A train that derailed in western Arizona was carrying corn syrup, the railroad said, after the county sheriff's office said it may have been carrying hazardous materials.

MOHAVE COUNTY, Ariz. -- A train that derailed in western Arizona Wednesday evening was carrying corn syrup, the railroad said, after the county sheriff's office said it may have been carrying hazardous materials.

""BNSF Railway can confirm that a train carrying corn syrup derailed"" around 7:40 p.m., company spokesperson Lena Kent told CNN in an email. ""There were no injuries as a result of the derailment and preliminarily reports indicate there are no hazardous materials involved.""

A spokesperson for the Mohave County Sheriff's Office earlier said the train was reportedly carrying hazardous materials.

No spills have been reported, though there are washes running through the area from recent storms, Anita Mortensen, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office, said.

The derailment occurred near milepost 9 of Interstate 40, Mortensen said, which is a rural, non-residential area. The highway exit is home to a handful of truck stops and is about 20 miles north of Lake Havasu City.

An estimated eight cars derailed and are blocking the main track, according to Kent. The cause of the derailment is under investigation and it's not clear when the track will reopen, the freight railroad company said.

The derailment comes a week after another train careened off the tracks in rural West Virginia, injuring three crew members and spilling diesel fuel into a nearby river, and over a month after a fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, released potentially hazardous chemicals into the air, soil and water and required extensive cleanup efforts.

The National Transportation Safety Board has been notified of the incident and is responding to investigate, Mortensen said.

CNN has sought comment from the NTSB.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described what the train was carrying. It was carrying corn syrup, but no hazardous materials, according to BNSF Railway.

(KABC) -- New details emerged Thursday as the investigation continued into the cause of a derailment that occurred after a passenger train struck a water truck in Moorpark.

The driver of the truck was a Ventura County Public Works Agency employee who was providing dust control to nearby workers at the time of the collision on Wednesday morning, according to investigators. The crew was cleaning up a debris basin.

Why the vehicle was in the path of the train, which had about 200 people onboard, remained unclear.

The crash occurred shortly before 11:30 near Los Angeles Avenue and Gabbert Road. Several of the train cars were dislodged from the tracks but all of them remained upright.

Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday night after an Amtrak train was derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

Sixteen people were transported to a hospital after the collision. The train occupants sustained minor injuries, while the driver was taken to a trauma center.

On Thursday afternoon, crews were seen installing new tracks at the crash site as train service remained suspended.

Oxnard resident Ricky Williams, who commutes to downtown Los Angeles, said the trip usually takes him an hour and 40 minutes on the train. On Thursday he was forced to drive to the Moorpark station, which lengthened his commute to more than two hours.

""For me, it's not frustrating at all because I've been doing this for over 10 years,"" Williams said.

No estimate has been given by Amtrak of when train service will resume at the location.

The pilot was the sole occupant onboard, and was pulled from the aircraft - moments before the train came crashing in. The Los Angeles Police Department posted body camera footage of the incident as it was unfolding showing the officers pulling the pilot to safety.

According to a tweet posted by the LAPD Valley Bureau, the plane had lost power and crashed onto the tracks.

The pilot was taken to the hospital in an unknown condition. No other injuries were reported.

The damaged plane remained on or near Metrolink Antelope Valley line train tracks, and all train movement was restricted in that area, the LAFD added. One or more lanes of San Fernando Road and Osborne Street were closed in the area while crews investigated the crash and conducted cleanup operations.

The incident remains under investigation.

The fatal incident happened around 6 a.m. behind the Burbank Animal Shelter on North Victory Place.

The train service was suspended while police investigated. Passengers were taken off the train as part of the investigation.

Investigators say they spoke with the conductor of the Metrolink train, who remained at the scene after the collision. Neither drugs nor alcohol were believed to be contributing factors regarding the conductor.

After speaking with witnesses and reviewing surveillance video, it was determined the man intentionally positioned himself across the train tracks as the train was approaching. The train, which was traveling southbound, was unable to stop and struck the man.

The conductor and passengers did not sustain any injuries.

Metrolink said it's offering a $50 reimbursement for all those passengers on Train 100 to find their own alternate transportation.

The locomotive initially caught fire but the flames were eventually extinguished, according to a Union Pacific spokesperson.

The derailment happened around 7:30 a.m. near 5th and K streets in Colton, on a stretch of track just south of the 10 Freeway, east of Rancho Avenue. Police and firefighters responded to the scene.

There was just lumber on board, but the Colton Fire Department had to quickly put out a small fire that started near one of the engines.

Within a couple of hours, contractors were already on scene working to clean up the mess.

Union Pacific officials added an unknown amount of diesel was spilled.

A contracted worker who was assisting in the cleanup was injured in the process and was taken to a hospital.

""They were trying to move that car over there, and they put the hook on a spot that wasn't real strong on the car, so the tractor ripped it off and the chain hit him, so I'm pretty sure it broke his arm,"" a witness said about how the injury happened.

No other injuries were reported.

The derailment happened at a point where some tracks take a left-hand turn to go under the freeway and head north, while other tracks continue east. It's unclear which direction the train was headed.

There are several homes that back right up to the tracks, but they weren't impacted.

A pair of hikers had a frighteningly close encounter with a mountain lion while on a trail in Orange County.

""We have feral donkeys in the canyon here,"" explained Redlands spokesperson Carl Baker. ""There's a water source on the other side of the tracks that attracts them. So they are either crossing a busy road or railroad tracks.""

Meanwhile, Janet O'Connor, who owns the Sundance Ranch on the San Bernardino County line, says more needs to be done to curb the donkey population, which she says is overwhelming the community and making roadways unsafe for drivers and other animals.

""I mean I am an animal lover. I have horses and burros, but something has to be done so this doesn't happen all the time,"" she said.

Both Riverside and San Bernardino Counties have experienced challenges with wild donkeys.

In response to the latest incident San Bernardino County said in a statement that reads in part, ""The Animals Are First Fund (ARFF), San Bernardino County's non-profit charitable organization, is in negotiations with DonkeyLand Rescue to schedule the next phase of the burro sterilization project.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Officials in San Francisco are promising a full investigation after a frightening video was released showing a woman getting her finger caught in a closing train door and dragged onto the tracks under the train.

In the surveillance video, the woman can be seen walking down the stairs at the city's Embarcadero station on April 12 when she tries to get on the Muni train as the doors are closing. It appears as though her hand gets stuck in the door as it is closing. She can be seen talking to an employee standing on the platform just feet away, but the train starts moving and she is dragged off the platform and under the train.

The woman was reportedly injured, but officials have not said how seriously.

The video was first acquired by the San Francisco Examiner.

""The door closed with less than a half an inch of space between the door and the door jam when she reached her hand in the door,"" Paul Rose, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency spokesperson, said in an interview with San Francisco ABC station KGO.

The SFMTA, which operates the train line, recently purchased new Muni train cars, including the one involved in the accident.

""These trains, and doors are safe,"" Rose said. ""They operate as designed, they were certified by CPUC [ California Public Utilities Commission ] and they've gone through six months of tests before we put them in service.""

The CPUC has said it will investigate the doors and the pin system, according to KGO.

""I heard shouting behind me, and I didn't know what was going on, but there was a commotion and I was scared honestly,"" eyewitness Will Hayworth told KGO. ""She was trying to keep up with this train and this new Muni car was dragging her by her hand. ...

""There clearly needs to be some different sensors on the doors or some way for riders to be able to see it in a different way,"" Haney said. ""My understanding is that some of the operators actually flagged that this was an issue and they were concerned about it.""

Crews had to fight the creek's fast-moving currents to pull riders from the partially submerged rail car, Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly said.

""It was dark, wet, it was raining. It was very chaotic,"" Kelly said. ""This is an absolute miracle that no one was killed, no passengers or first responders.""

Four people were seriously hurt, while 10 others had minor injuries, Kelly said.

The Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) No. 10 commuter train was traveling from San Jose to Stockton when the first two cars went off the tracks near Niles Canyon Road in Sunol, a rural area of Alameda County about 45 miles east of San Francisco.

Altamont Corridor Express train official Steve Walker said the first car was carrying six passengers and one crew member when it fell into Alameda Creek.

Walker told San Jose television station KNTV the second car behind it also derailed but remained upright.

He said three more cars behind, including the locomotive, stayed on the tracks.

Images posted on Twitter by Alameda County Fire Department showed that car on its side about half-submerged in the creek water.

Passengers were evacuated and checked by paramedics. The uninjured riders were transported to the Alameda County Fair in Pleasanton, the department said.

Altamont Corridor Express said it sent buses to take passengers to their destinations. The company also said it was cancelling all train service on the line Tuesday.

Felicia Smith was just three weeks shy of her 25th birthday when the tragedy happened.

Candles were lit and balloons were sent into the sky during the vigil for her. Hymns were also sung to remember the 24-year-old. She died Monday when she slipped off a platform and was hit by an oncoming train in Sylmar.

""I wish I could have shown her that I'm doing good because that's all she wanted,"" one of Smith's sisters said.

Smith leaves behind an identical twin sister, Alicia. The pair shared an inseparable bond.

The mother and godmother of Felicia Smith, a 24-year-old woman who died after falling off a platform and being hit by a train in Sylmar, got together to remember the kind, ambitious person she was.

Family members said Smith was working and going to school to become a social worker. She was someone who was always looking to help others.

She was described as ambitious and raised by a village of women. Her mother and godmother got together earlier Wednesday to comfort one another before the vigil.

Jennifer Miller Smith said her daughter helped her go back to school.

SUNOL, Calif. -- Crews are working to clear the scene after a commuter train struck a tree and derailed in Northern California, plunging its lead car into a rain-swollen creek and sending passengers scrambling in the dark to get out of the partially submerged car.

The Ace Train was traveling from San Jose to Stockton when it derailed in Alameda County Monday night. It was a chaotic scene with emergency rescuers jumping into the chilly creek to rescue passengers. Rescuers said you could hear screams over the radio.

There were more than 200 people on board the train. Nine people were injured and two of the victims remain hospitalized. All of the injured are expected to survive.

All ACE Train service was canceled for Tuesday.

Seeing the derailed train in the light of day was a shock for workers as they arrived at the scene Tuesday morning, with many saying they felt like they were looking at the set of a movie.

""If my rig would get stuck I would call the police right away and let them know, 'Hey! Can they stop this train?'"" said truck driving student Charles Piggee.

Driving instructors at United Driving School in Riverside say that's right.

At every railroad crossing, you'll find an equipment box with the crossing location and a phone number on it. If you get stuck, instructors advise calling that number immediately.

""That lets them know exactly what crossing you're at and they can get a hold of the train and tell them what to do,"" said truck driving supervisor Wayne Ewing.

Driving students are also taught to never shift gears with a manual transmission while crossing the tracks. That's to prevent you from accidentally stalling and getting stuck. Above all else, instructors say you should always remember the potential danger.

""You can't beat a train. There's just no beating a train. It could be your life and it could be someone else's life as well,"" said truck driving instructor Amber Simmons.

The identity of the victim was not yet released. The 40 passengers in the Union Station-bound train were not injured and were removed from the subway train.

The incident prompted a disruption of service between the Hollywood and Vine stop and Vermont and Santa Monica stop. Metro said bus shuttles were requested and replaced trains in that route. It was unclear how long the transit closure would last.

The crash was caught on dashcam video by another driver who sent the footage using #abc7eyewitness.

Los Angeles County firefighters came across a car on the tracks at Marquardt and Rosecrans avenues shortly after 6 p.m. They contacted dispatchers, but before the train could be stopped, a BNSF freight train came barreling down the tracks.

""We are at Rosecrans and Marquardt. We have a vehicle trapped on the tracks. I need you to shut down the La Mirada Burlington Northern Railroad line through this area,"" a dispatcher said.

The train struck the vehicle, but no one was inside the car. Firefighters requested an ambulance as a precaution.

The result? The car was remarkably still largely intact, but it left a trail of parts across the intersection during its rough ride.

The driver, who by then was sitting in a nearby ambulance, was unharmed but shaken.

She told Eyewitness News she is a Thousand Oaks resident visiting a friend in the area. She meant to turn right onto the road, but accidentally drove onto the train tracks and got stuck -- something police said actually happens fairly often at the crossing.

The woman called 911, realizing she was stuck. The responding officers frantically tried to warn trains in the area but, clearly, they weren't able to get word out in time.

Train service for Metrolink and BNSF was temporarily delayed in the area, but resumed later after the wreckage of the vehicle was towed.

(KABC) -- A 54-year-old truck driver from Yuma, Arizona was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run after a Metrolink train headed toward Los Angeles struck his large pickup truck, which was hauling a trailer, on the tracks in Oxnard Tuesday. No fatalities were reported, Oxnard police said.

Ventura County Line Train 102 crashed at about 5:40 a.m. near 5th Street and Rice Avenue. The vehicle caught fire after the crash.

Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez managed to flee the scene, Oxnard fire officials said. An officer spotted Ramirez walking on Rice Avenue about 1.62 miles south of the accident and determined that he was the driver.

""It appeared that he was very distressed. The person appeared to be disoriented and on the phone,"" Oxnard Assistant Police Chief Jason Benites said.

Ramirez was not injured, but was taken to Ventura County Medical Center for observation. He was arrested following his release from the hospital. He has a valid driver's license, police said.

Benites said the 2005 Ford-450 pickup truck appeared to be traveling southbound on 5th Street, and in attempting to make a right turn onto a street, instead turned onto railroad tracks and got stuck. It was unclear if the area was part of his regular route.

PHOTOS: Metrolink commuter train derails in Oxnard

Before the crash, the train was leaving from the Oxnard station. With two miles of straight tracks, the driver of the train was able to spot the vehicle on the tracks early and pulled the brakes and provided warning signals. Authorities said the train had been going eastbound slower than 79 mph cruising speed.

Upon impact, five cars derailed, including three seen on their side and two upright, fire officials said.

""The whole truck was just up in flames, or car, I didn't know what it was. It was a fireball,"" Ted Maloney said. He immediately went inside the train car to help passengers. Maloney found a sweater and wrapped it around the neck of a female victim, who was bleeding.

""I just held her hand and comforted her and told her help was on the way,"" Maloney said.

A total of 49 people were on the train, including 46 passengers and three crew members. Authorities say 28 people were taken to area hospitals, with four in critical condition. One of the four in critical condition was the train engineer. The conductor and his assistant were treated and released.

""Patients have complained of dizziness, of headaches, of lower back pain, of pains related to being bumped, thrown, hit and so forth,"" said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer at Ventura County Medical Center.

Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten credited crash safety technology to softening the blow of the collision. About two-thirds of the Metrolink fleet is 5 years old or less and is equipped with the technology.

""The front end of the cab car is designed to crumple by nature to help absorb the energy of that collision,"" Lustgarten said.

The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate the crash.

"" [ Federal Railroad Administration investigators ] will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the factors that contributed to this accident. Safety must be every railroad's absolute top priority and we will establish what lapses, if any, occurred and order any necessary corrective actions,"" a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration said.

Experts will investigate if the crossing arms were working properly. They will also check the train's recorders. Authorities are optimistic the train had inward and outward facing cameras.

Approximately 24 freight trains and four passenger trains pass through the track near 5th Street and Rice Avenue per day, said Constance Gordon, a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission.

There have been 11 incidents on this specific crossing in the last 10 years, not including the incident which occurred Tuesday. The last incident occurred on June 3, 2014. Gordon said two people were killed.

The train tracks appeared to be heavily damaged following the crash Tuesday, which caused delays and cancellations for Metrolink and Amtrak trains. Amtrak train service between Los Angeles and Goleta was suspended for Tuesday.

Regularly scheduled Metrolink service continued between Union Station in Los Angeles and Moorpark. Buses were provided for passengers traveling beyond Moorpark, with stops at Camarillo, Oxnard and east Ventura.

Repairs could take several months, Lustgarten said.

Eight of the 28 people transported to local area hospitals were admitted. Four of them remain in critical condition in an intensive care unit. Twenty patients were treated at the emergency rooms and released.

Twenty-two patients were checked out by medical personnel at the accident scene near 5th Street and Rice Avenue and released, said Ventura County Emergency Medical Services administrator Steve Carroll.

""There was a need at one point to calm him and sedate him,"" he said.

Wong says the train engineer is showing positive signs and complete coherence.

""He certainly recognized his son, who was at the bedside. He was very encouraged. He was squeezing his hand,"" Wong said. ""He was, you know, able to answer some very deeper questions about things about his medications, about things in his past, and so certainly he was there mentally which was really encouraging to us as staff.""

A veteran of the train system tells Eyewitness News the control cab is like a tin can. There is little to protect the engineer.

The driver of the vehicle involved in the collision, Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona was taken to the Ventura County Medical Center for observation. He underwent several tests that doctors would not disclose and was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run following his release from the hospital.

""It appeared that he was very distressed. The person appeared to be disoriented and on the phone,"" Oxnard Assistant Police Chief Jason Benites said.

Wong said the victims suffered injuries typical of high-speed accidents, including head trauma, back injuries and broken bones, but nothing life-threatening.

""He was working on his laptop when suddenly he felt a very violent jerking motion, so quick that he wasn't able to even grab onto the seat or anything around him, but he was thrown against the side of the train at that point.""

https://abc7.com/13436972,train crash,2,2023-06-29,Amtrak train partially derails after water truck obstructs tracks in Moorpark; 16 injured,"Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday night after an Amtrak train was derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

MOORPARK, Calif. (KABC) -- Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday evening after an Amtrak train derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

Officials said a total of 16 people were injured, including the driver of the water truck, but there were no serious injuries. If train cars had actually toppled over completely, officials believe there would have been a lot more people injured.

""We're very lucky today that the trains stayed on the wheels,"" said Andy Vansciver of Ventura County Fire. ""Obviously, it was derailed but it stayed vertical. I think that really limited the amount of injuries we had.""

AIR7 HD was above the scene and captured the train with several of its cars off the tracks.

People could also be seen on ambulance stretchers. One couple was headed to the hospital after one of them suffered an arm injury.

The train was traveling westbound and filled with more than 200 people at the time at the crash. Some of the passengers spoke with Eyewitness News about the ordeal.

""Yeah, I was listening to an audio tape when and I was laying back on the sofa, and all of a sudden, we hit very hard and things were flying around,"" said Debbie Welsford of Anaheim. ""Our luggage, my cup, the water ... everything was just flying around the room and we realized we hit something so we came out and looked and saw the water tank.""

""It was very brief. Felt the train make impact and, you know, flew me forward in the car,"" said Matthew Roberts of Paso Robles. ""Immediately got up to see if everyone around me was ok. The car filled with a lot of dust and it took about 30 seconds for the train to come to a stop and we assessed the situation, made sure everyone was ok, and got to the exit and that was it.""

The water truck was delivering water to local ranches in the rural area when it got in the way of the train. The driver was talking with police before being taken to the hospital. It's unclear why the water truck was in the train's way.

Officials were bussing the uninjured passengers to the Moorpark Senior Center where they could be reunited with loved ones. Amtrak worked with passengers to help them get to their final destination.

The train was set to stop in Oxnard on its way to Seattle.

The tracks themselves have been damaged due to the collision as well and it was unclear how people who use the line to and from work would be able to travel home Wednesday night.

Amtrak released the following statement on the crash:

""On June 28, 2023, Amtrak train 14 was traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle at approx. 11:15 a.m. PT when it struck a water truck obstructing the tracks at Moorpark, California. There were approximately 198 passengers and 13 crew onboard who were evacuated from the train, with no reports of serious injuries. The train derailed as a result of the impact but remained upright. Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements. Amtrak, in coordination with local authorities, is conducting a full investigation.""

Amtrak services between Ventura and Los Angeles have been suspended since the train is on the track that connects the two.

SOUTH LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Two people were injured and an SUV was split in half following a horrific crash involving a Metro Blue Line train in South Los Angeles Thursday afternoon, according to authorities.

L.A. Fire Department officials say the crash was reported just before 3:45 p.m. in the 1600 block of E. Vernon Avenue, near Vernon Station.

Footage from the scene showed the vehicle severely damaged and squeezed between the train and a small fence.

Preliminary information indicates the driver made a left turn in front of the train, resulting in the collision. Firefighters extricated a woman from the vehicle and transported her to a hospital in unknown condition.

Dozens of passengers were on board the train at the time of the crash, but none were apparently hurt. A pedestrian, who was not hit by the train, suffered a minor injury and was also transported to a hospital.

Shuttle buses transported passengers between Slauson and Washington stations due to the crash, according to Metro.

It's unknown when the portion of the train route impacted by the crash will reopen.

LOS ANGELES (CNS) -- A former locomotive engineer at the Port of Los Angeles was sentenced to three years behind bars Wednesday for intentionally running a train at full speed off the tracks near the Navy hospital ship Mercy, claiming the vessel was docked at the port as part of a possible ""government takeover.''

Eduardo Moreno of San Pedro, 46, pleaded guilty last year to a federal charge of committing a terrorist attack and other violence against railroad carriers and mass transportation systems.

No one was injured in the March 31, 2020, incident and the USNS Mercy was not damaged. The train leaked fuel that required a hazardous-materials cleanup.

An engineer deliberately ran a train off the tracks at high speed in Los Angeles in an attempt to damage the USNS Mercy hospital ship, prosecutors say.

In an interview with FBI agents, Moreno stated that he ran the train off the track out of a desire ""to wake people up'' because the Mercy was ""suspicious'' and not ""what they say it's for,'' according to documents filed in Los Angeles federal court.

The crash was witnessed by a California Highway Patrol officer, who took Moreno into custody as he fled the scene, federal prosecutors said.

The officer reported seeing ""the train smash into a concrete barrier at the end of the track, smash into a steel barrier, smash into a chain-link fence, slide through a parking lot, slide across another lot filled with gravel and smash into a second chain-link fence,'' according to court papers.

When the CHP officer contacted Moreno, he made a series of spontaneous statements, including, ""You only get this chance once. The whole world is watching. I had to. People don't know what's going on here. Now they will,'' according to court filings.

In his first interview with port police, Moreno admitted crashing the train, saying he was suspicious of the Mercy and believed it had an alternate purpose related to COVID-19, such as a ""government takeover,'' prosecutors said.

Moreno said he acted alone and had not pre-planned the attack. While admitting to intentionally derailing and crashing the train, he said he knew it would bring media attention and ""people could see for themselves,'' referring to the Mercy, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

The L.A. Port Police reviewed video recorded from the locomotive's cab, officials said. One video shows the train clearly moving at a high rate of speed before crashing through various barriers and coming into close proximity to three occupied vehicles. A second video shows Moreno in the cab holding a lighted flare, according to prosecutors.

SAN PEDRO, LOS ANGELES (CNS) -- A former locomotive engineer at the Port of Los Angeles on Thursday pleaded guilty to a federal terrorism charge for intentionally running a train at full speed off the tracks near the Navy hospital ship Mercy last year, claiming the vessel was docked at the port as part of a conspiracy, possibly a ""government takeover.''

Eduardo Moreno of San Pedro, 45, entered his plea to a charge of committing a terrorist attack and other violence against railroad carriers and mass transportation systems, which carries a potential prison sentence of up to 20 years and lifetime supervised release, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

However, Moreno's plea agreement states that the government intends to seek a sentence of about six-and-a-half years and restitution of $700,000 to be paid to Pacific Harbor Line, the railroad company at the port.

SAN PEDRO, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- An engineer deliberately ran a train off the tracks at high speed near the Port of Los Angeles in an attempt to crash into the USNS Mercy hospital ship, prosecutors say.

The Pacific Harbor Line train derailed Tuesday, running through the end of the track and crashing through barriers, finally coming to rest about 250 yards from the docked naval ship.

Federal prosecutors allege train engineer Eduardo Moreno, 44, of San Pedro intended to hit the ship, saying he thought it was ""suspicious"" and did not believe ""the ship is what they say it's for.'""

The train crashed into a concrete barrier at the end of the track, smashed through a steel barrier and a chain-link fence, slid through one parking lot and then a second lot filled with gravel and hit a second chain-link fence. It came to rest after passing under a ramp leading to the Vincent Thomas Bridge. The train remained in that position Wednesday.

No one was injured in the derailment, but the train leaked fuel that required a hazmat response.

The U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy received its first patients Sunday after docking at the Port of Los Angeles.

Authorities say Moreno admitted to crashing the train intentionally, but said he did not plan it out in advance. It is believed that he acted alone.

He allegedly made statements to a CHP officer that included ""You only get this chance once. The whole world is watching. I had to. People don't know what's going on here. Now they will.""

Officials say video from inside the train's cab shows Moreno holding a lighted flare during the incident.

Moreno has been charged with one count of train wrecking, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison.

The Mercy arrived at the Port of Los Angeles this weekend.

The Navy hospital ship was brought in to handle non-coronavirus patients, to help ease the burden of local hospitals that are surging with COVID-19 cases.

The ship has about 1,000 hospital beds, with some 800 active-duty doctors, nurses and medical staff on board.

SAN PEDRO, LOS ANGELES (CNS) -- Bail was denied today for a Port of Los Angeles train engineer charged with running a locomotive at full speed off the end of rail tracks near the USNS Mercy hospital ship, claiming the vessel was docked at the port for nefarious purposes.

During a brief hearing, Eduardo Moreno was ordered detained pending trial after a federal magistrate judge determined that the 44-year-old San Pedro man posed a danger to the community, as well as a flight risk.

Moreno was not in court because he waived his appearance at certain court hearings. His attorney did not oppose the government's motion for detention. Moreno is expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles federal court on May 7.

The U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy received its first patients Sunday after docking at the Port of Los Angeles.

He is charged in a criminal complaint with one federal count of train wrecking, which carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Moreno was arrested Tuesday and turned over to FBI agents early Wednesday morning.

According to the criminal complaint, Moreno admitted in two separate interviews with law enforcement authorities that he intentionally derailed and crashed the train near the Mercy on Tuesday afternoon. Moreno ran the train off the end of tracks and crashed through a series of barriers before coming to rest more than 250 yards from the Mercy, prosecutors allege.

No one was injured and the Mercy was not damaged. The train leaked fuel that required a hazardous materials cleanup. The train crash was witnessed by a California Highway Patrol officer, who took Moreno into custody as he fled the scene, federal prosecutors said.

The CHP officer who witnessed the crash reported seeing the train smash into a concrete barrier at the end of the track, smash into a steel barrier, smash into a chain-link fence, slide through a parking lot, slide across another lot filled with gravel and smash into a second chain-link fence,'' according to the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.

An engineer deliberately ran a train off the tracks at high speed in an attempt to damage the USNS Mercy hospital ship, prosecutors say.

When the CHP officer contacted Moreno, he made a series of spontaneous statements, including, You only get this chance once. The whole world is watching. I had to. People don't know what's going on here. Now they will,'' according to court papers.

In his first interview with port police, Moreno admitted crashing the train, saying he was suspicious of the Mercy and believed it had an alternate purpose related to COVID-19, such as a government takeover,'' prosecutors said.

Moreno allegedly stated that he acted alone and had not pre-planned the attack. While admitting to intentionally derailing and crashing the train, he said he knew it would bring media attention and people could see for themselves,'' referring to the Mercy, according to the affidavit.

In a second interview with FBI agents, Moreno said that he did it out of the desire to wake people up,''' according to the affidavit. Moreno stated that he thought that the U.S.N.S. Mercy was suspicious and did not believe the ship is what they say it's for,''' according to court documents.

The L.A. Port Police reviewed video recorded from the locomotive's cab. One video shows the train clearly moving at a high rate of speed before crashing through various barriers and coming into close proximity to three occupied vehicles. A second video shows Moreno in the cab holding a lighted flare, according to the affidavit.

The Mercy docked at the port on March 27. Its 1,000 hospital beds are to be used as a relief valve for Southland hospitals overrun with coronavirus patients.

Flames engulf Metrolink train after crash on tracks in Santa Fe Springs

A recreational vehicle that was left on train tracks in Santa Fe Springs was struck by a Metrolink train and burst into flames Friday morning.

""We got buffeted around pretty good, and it felt like we might derail for a second or two,"" train passenger Mike Lozano said.

Shortly after the collision, a freight train arrived on the parallel tracks.

""You could hear it coming, and it was coming really fast, you could tell,"" Lozano said.

Another passenger said he braced for potential impact as he heard the sound of the freight train quickly approaching.

""That was honestly the longest few seconds of my life, like when I heard the train horn coming, I was just looking around, everyone was looking around, are we even going to be safe? Do they know that this just happened? Because it sounded like they didn't,"" Ryan Hajek described.

The freight train ran over debris from the crash before coming to a stop as the fire from the Metrolink train started to spread.

AIR7 HD was over the scene, where dozens of evacuated passengers waited in a nearby parking lot while crews battled the flames. Four passengers who suffered minor injuries were treated and later released, according to officials.

""The hit was such an impact on the train,"" passenger Rosalind Carter said. ""I remember being flung into the seat next to me, I hit my head, it was just pretty traumatic.""

A man who said he was a Metrolink passenger told Eyewitness News that a train crashed into a vehicle slammed on the brakes as it was approaching the intersection in Santa Fe Springs.

The crash caused significant train delays and cancellations. Metrolink offered ticket reimbursements for some customers and advised affected passengers to find their own transportation as ""alternate"" transportation was limited.

Many passengers who frequently ride the train said the crash could've been a lot worse but were thankful for the quick response of Metrolink employees and first responders.

https://abc7.com/4213656,train crash,6,2018-09-11,Metrolink touts safety changes on 10-year anniversary of devastating crash,"Metrolink has invested in safety changes on its trains to prevent deadly crashes.

CHATSWORTH, Calif. (KABC) -- Wednesday marks 10 years since the deadliest crash in Metrolink's history.

Twenty-five people were killed and more than 100 others were injured when a Metrolink commuter train collided head-on with a freight train near Chatsworth, crumbling passenger cars and leading to desperate rescues in the fiery rubble.

Now, a decade later, Metrolink's CEO Art Leahy, showed Eyewitness News the safety changes that have been made on every Metrolink train since, so a deadly crash like that never happens again.

""It's horrific,"" Leahy said, describing the crash scene 10 years ago. ""It creates images in your mind that will never go away.""

The commuter rail line had a $200 million dollar computer system called Positive Train Control installed three years ago. The system sounds an alert if there is a stopped or oncoming train on the same track.

Alerts also sound if the engineer is going too fast for an upcoming curve. If the engineer doesn't react to the alert, the PTC computer takes over, and slows the train down. Leahy said PTC would have prevented the Chatsworth crash had it been installed 10 years ago.

""What would have happened is our train would have detected the presence of the freight train that was stopped,"" Leahy said. ""In addition to that, on the freight train there would have been PTC which would have detected the presence of our train, and both trains would have stopped before they collided.""

Leahy said PTC would have even kicked in while the Metrolink engineer at the controls a decade ago was distracted. According to investigators, the engineer was texting moments before the deadly crash. Cameras are now clearly present above where the train engineers sit.

""So if something unusual happens in the train, we can go back and look at the video and see what was going on,"" Leahy said.

The CEO also said he has not been made aware of a single engineer using a phone on the job during his four years as CEO of Metrolink.

There are also new crash emergency management cars on the trains that can absorb energy better during impact, helping to redistribute the force of a crash.

Amid the changes, Congress has also issued a deadline for all trains nationwide to have PTC installed by the end of 2018 -- a deadline Leahy said will likely pass without everyone on board.

""I'm not sure at all that every railroad will have PTC,"" Leahy said. ""There's been a great deal of resistance because of high cost.""

He believes the cost for the system is justified to save lives and make sure another deadly crash never happens again.",TRAIN CRASH/TRANSPORTATION/TRAINS/TRAIN SAFETY,https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/4216381_091118-kabc-4pm-metrolink-anniversary-vid.jpg?w=1600,"Ten years since the deadliest crash in its history, Metrolink has invested in safety changes on its trains to prevent crashes."

(KABC) -- National Transportation Safety Board investigators are revealing more about Tuesday's Metrolink train crash in Oxnard. This as a lawyer for the driver who abandoned his pickup truck on the tracks speaks out.

The repair work is done but the investigation is far from over. NTSB says it's unclear if the pickup truck hit by the Metrolink train was stuck on the tracks at the point of impact.

About 2,100 crossing accidents occur each year, but Tuesday's derailment drew NTSB attention because the truck was found having driven down the tracks. Investigators are expected to remain on scene for five to seven days.

""Our objective is to collect perishable evidence,"" said Robert Sumwalt with the National Transportation Safety Board. ""We are not here to speculate. We never speculate at the NTSB. We're not here on scene to determine the cause of the accident. We're not here on scene to analyze. I know everybody wants to know what happened, and we will determine that, but our goal here is to collect that information that will go away with the passage of time.""

As part of the investigation, NTSB plans to do a sight distance test, which means they will set up a mock situation to see how far down the track each person could actually see from both the train and pickup truck.

The NTSB is also looking at video and data equipment on the train that captured the fiery crash and should give investigators a big boost to the search for a cause. The video is now being examined at the agency's Washington home. Their investigation will likely take months to complete.

PHOTOS: Metrolink commuter train derails in Oxnard

Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, 55, of Yuma, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of felony hit-and-run after a Metrolink train headed toward Los Angeles struck his large pickup truck, which was hauling a trailer, on the tracks in Oxnard. He remains in custody in lieu of $150,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday.

Information from the control cab showed the train engineer managed to hit the brakes early, but could not avoid the crash. Sumwalt said the train was traveling under the speed limit of 79 mph.

Ramirez's lawyer Ron Bamieh called the collision an ""accident."" At the time, Ramirez was driving his company's truck and trailer. He has been employed by the same produce trucking company, The Grower's Company, Inc., for 12 years.

""The arrest of Mr. Ramirez is the unfortunate result of law enforcement attempting to cast blame on a man who was caught in a tragic situation with no way to stop the oncoming tragedy. He does not know how or why the truck he was driving stopped on the tracks, and wishes there was something he could have done to prevent this accident,"" Bamieh said.

Bamieh added that his office's investigation showed that Ramirez's truck did become ""entangled and unable to move off the railroad tracks. The truck and the trailer were somehow stuck.""

Ramirez accidentally drove onto the tracks and made the situation worse by continuing forward in an attempt to get enough speed to get his wide pickup over the rails, Bamieh said. When that effort failed, he tried to push the truck and then fled before impact.

""He hits his high beams trying to do something. He's screaming. He realizes, 'I can't do anything,' and then he tries to run so he doesn't get killed,"" Bamieh said. ""He saw the impact, yes, it was a huge explosion.""

Oxnard police say they found Ramirez 1.62 miles south of the crash site and that Ramirez did not call 911 or make an immediate effort to call for help. But Bamieh said Ramirez, who doesn't speak English well, tried to get help from a passerby, tried calling his employer and eventually reached his son to help him speak with police.

""I think his first reaction was to try to find help on foot,"" Bamieh said. ""He's not familiar with the area. When he found out there was nobody around or there was nobody who could help, that's when he called his son to ask to help. He was very nervous. He was very upset. He was in shock and he was trying to find the best way to help people.""

Ramirez has been married for 30 years and has two children, his lawyer said. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence.

About 50 people were on board. Twenty-eight people were taken to five nearby area hospitals, including four in critical condition. No fatalities were reported.

Six patients remain hospitalized at Ventura County Medical Center Wednesday, including three patients listed in critical condition.

The Metrolink train engineer suffered severe injuries to his chest and heart, said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer at Ventura County Medical Center.

""Around 10 a.m., he had a turn for the worse. His heart actually stopped. He had a cardiac arrest,"" Wong said. ""Thankfully, he was already within the ICU and he was immediately responded to. Resuscitation efforts were undertaken. His heart came back and yet again stopped once again within minutes of the first arrest. Continued efforts were made and actually they were able to bring back his heart.""

A 44-year-old female remains hospitalized at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks.

On Wednesday, clean-up efforts continued. All derailed cars had been removed from scene. Track repairs were complete by late-Wednesday morning.

Several Metrolink commuters on Wednesday traveled regularly on the same line of the train that had crashed the day prior.

""First, was shocked and actually also blessed that I wasn't on the train, but more shocked to the people on the train. I feel bad for the people who were injured,"" Camarillo resident Gavin Gobuyan said.

""Right now, I'm getting kind of nervous, but it's in God's hands. You just ride and try to deal with it and hopefully get to your destination,"" Camarillo resident Ken Villa said.

""Everyone associated with Metrolink extends our most heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and co-workers.""

Metrolink said Steele had worked in the rail industry for more than 40 years and was the longest tenured engineer among Metrolink operators.

The collision on Feb. 24 remains under investigation.

Oxnard police said in a statement that the death ""changes the dimension of the on-going investigation.""

Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, the truck driver involved in the crash, was released from custody Thursday after the Ventura County District Attorney's Office announced that no charges would be filed against him at this time.

The D.A.'s office said it would wait for the completion of the investigation before any formal filing decision.

Ramirez's truck, which was pulling a trailer, was stopped on the tracks, causing a Metrolink commuter train to crash into the vehicle and derail. The National Transportation Safety Board said the train was going about 56 mph at the time of collision.

Dozens of people were injured.

Ramirez's lawyer Ron Bamieh has previously said his client accidentally drove onto the tracks and became stuck, so the 55-year-old ran for his life.

The full investigation of the collision is expected to take several months to complete.

CAMARILLO, Calif. (KABC) -- An Amtrak train with 85 people on board hit a vehicle that was stuck on the tracks near Pleasant Valley Road and Fifth Street in Camarillo Sunday, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said. No injuries were reported.

Deputies say the two occupants of the vehicle exited the car before it was hit by the train at about 8 p.m., just a few miles away from the site of last week's derailment.

The vehicle ended up in a ditch following the collision. It wasn't immediately clear why it had stopped on the tracks. It was raining heavily at the time.

The passengers on board the train were assessed by emergency personnel at the scene.

OXNARD, Calif. (KABC) -- The truck driver involved in the Metrolink crash in Oxnard was released from custody Thursday night, hours after the Ventura County District Attorney's Office announced that no charges would be filed against him.

The district attorney is expected to wait for the completion of local and federal investigations before any formal filing decision.

""While charges will not be filed at this time, the arrest of Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez by the Oxnard Police Department was clearly appropriate and lawful,"" the district attorney's office released in a statement.

Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, 55, will be able to return home to Yuma, Arizona, but will return on May 4 to talk to investigators.

""My father and the rest of my family are praying for everyone's speedy recovery. Our concern and thoughts are with the victims of the accident,"" Ramirez's son Daniel Sanchez said.

Jose Ramirez, the truck driver involved in a Metrolink crash in Oxnard, is released from custody on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015.

On Tuesday, Ramirez's truck, which was pulling a trailer, was stopped on the tracks, causing a Metrolink commuter train to crash into the vehicle and derail. Dozens of people were injured, but no one was killed.

The National Transportation Safety Board revealed preliminary information from their investigation during a press conference Thursday afternoon.

Based on data recorder on the train, the horn sounded off 12 seconds before impact, the throttle was moved to idle 11 seconds before impact and the emergency brake was pulled eight seconds before impact. At the time of collision, the train was going about 56 mph, said Robert Sumwalt with NTSB.

Sumwalt noted these numbers may change slightly when the final investigation is released.

Based on camera footage, all signals were working properly. As the train was approached the crossing, the truck's headlights and emergency flashers were on and the driver's door was open, Sumwalt said.

The truck appeared to be straddling the rail and facing the train at an angle, but the trailer did not appear to be straddling the rail at all, Sumwalt said. Only the trailer was engulfed in flames after the crash.

Ramirez's lawyer Ron Bamieh has previously said his client accidentally drove onto the tracks and became stuck. Ramirez allegedly continued forward in an attempt to get enough speed to get his wide pickup over the rails and tried to push the truck, but wasn't able to and fled before impact.

Ramirez was scheduled to be in the Oxnard area for six weeks to service farm equipment. Ramirez's son told investigators that his father was not familiar to the area.

In the coming weeks, investigators plan to obtain cell phone records to see if Ramirez was using an electronic mapping device.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A 31-year-old USC film student was severely injured after a Metro train crashed into his car at the intersection of Exposition Boulevard and Watt Way near the school on Saturday.

Jacob Fadley, the driver of a silver 2013 Hyundai Sonata, was attempting to make a left turn onto Watt Way and into USC when the eastbound train crashed into the car. Authorities initially reported that the train had crashed into two cars.

Investigators said the violent impact wedged the car between a light pole and the train, pushing it from the tracks and crashing onto Exposition Boulevard.

""Obviously there's a signal for the train and a signal for the car. He turned in front of the train,"" said Dilijiet Sandhu, a Metro spokesman, noting the driver went against the signal.

Firefighters and paramedics were dispatched to the scene at 10:48 a.m. Three train cars were derailed during the crash.

Fadley, a Navy veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, had to be extracted from the car with the Jaws of Life, said Donald Frazeur, Los Angeles Fire Department assistant chief.

Authorities said 21 people were injured. Ten commuters suffering minor injuries, Fadley and the train operator were transported to a nearby hospital.

The train operator, identified as Kenneth Goss, has 29 years of experience and was released from the hospital Saturday night.

Metro officials were using buses to take passengers between the Vermont and 23rd Street station on the rail line. The full line was expected to reopen by Sunday morning as crews worked into the night to move the derailed train back onto the tracks.

There were no passengers on the Union Pacific train, but multiple cars containing iron ore derailed, officials said.

According to Union Pacific officials, 55 train cars, including two locomotives, derailed at 8:30 a.m., local time.

One locomotive suffered a minor leak, which is being investigated by hazmat officials, county fire officials said.

There were no injuries and no active fires, as well as no threat to the public or the environment, San Bernardino County Fire tweeted.

In a statement to ABC News, Union Pacific confirmed that the derailed cars did have iron ore, which spilled, but that it isn't hazardous and that there were no hazardous materials on the train.

""The crew was not in the cab at the time of the derailment and there was uncontrolled train movement,"" Union Pacific said in a statement. ""The crew was not injured.""

The derailment is currently being investigated, Union Pacific said.

The incident comes more than a month after a Norfolk Southern foreign train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, releasing vinyl chloride, ethyl acrylate and isobutylene into the environment.

Norfolk Southern officials had conducted a controlled burn of toxic chemicals from the train a few days after the derailment, which worried residents who expressed concerns they were exposed to high levels of the colorless gas vinyl chloride, which easily burns and is associated with an increased risk of several cancers, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Earlier this month, 28 cars of another Norfolk Southern train derailed near Springfield, Ohio, but no hazardous materials were involved, officials said.

The four empty tankers were previously carrying diesel exhaust fluid and an additive commonly used in wastewater treatment, according to Clark County, Ohio officials.

According to the United States Geological Survey, iron ore is important for steel production as it is the source of primary iron for steel and iron industries around the world.

In December, a Union Pacific freight train carrying iron ore derailed in Southern California, according to the Associated Press. There were no reported injuries.
