A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 14 others.

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident that took place some 497 miles away as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said that of the 15 people affected in Tuesday’s crash, three were seriously injured. Five others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 11 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash.

While Spain’s high-speed rail network runs smoothly, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues, though accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, about 35 minutes from Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator Adif said the containment wall probably collapsed because of heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week.

More bodies discovered in Sunday derailment

Antonio Sanz, the regional health minister of Andalusia, where Sunday’s accident occurred, told Spanish media that the official toll had risen after another corpse was discovered in a severely damaged car.

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl survived the wreck without major injury, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people were treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Malaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” said Johnson, sitting in a wheelchair because of bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

Carriages came off tracks

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif.

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Farther along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

‘All hypotheses are open’

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident that Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence [of the derailment],” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.

At this time, “all hypotheses are open,” Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska said during a news conference. Accident investigators will analyze “the rails at the point where the derailment began and inspect the wheels” of the first train in a laboratory, he added.

The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train belonged to Spain’s public train company, Renfe.

Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and had passed a safety check on Jan. 15.

Puente and Renfe President Álvaro Fernández said that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 155 mph and “human error could be ruled out.”

The accident shook a nation that leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport.

“It is undoubtedly a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Puente told Spanish national radio RNE on Tuesday when asked about the damage to the reputation of the rail system.

Royals visit scene

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the scene of the accident, where they greeted emergency workers as well as some residents who had helped in the initial stages of the rescue. Afterward, they went to a hospital in Cordoba where many of the injured remain under care.

“We are all responsible for not looking away when the debris of a catastrophe is being cleared away,” Letizia told reporters after the visit.

Spain’s Civil Guard is collecting DNA samples from family members who fear they have loved ones among the unidentified dead.

High-speed trains resumed service Tuesday from Madrid to Sevilla and Malaga, the largest cities in Andalusia, Spain’s most populous region, but passengers had to travel a stretch of the journey by buses provided by the rail service. Puente said normal train service won’t resume until early February.

","Emergency crews respond after a commuter train derailed when a retaining wall collapsed onto the tracks in Gelida, Spain, on Jan. 20, 2026.

This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here .

A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 14 others.

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident that took place some 497 miles away as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said that of the 15 people affected in Tuesday’s crash, three were seriously injured. Five others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 11 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash.

While Spain’s high-speed rail network runs smoothly, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues, though accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, about 35 minutes from Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator Adif said the containment wall probably collapsed because of heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week.

Antonio Sanz, the regional health minister of Andalusia, where Sunday’s accident occurred, told Spanish media that the official toll had risen after another corpse was discovered in a severely damaged car.

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl survived the wreck without major injury, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people were treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Malaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” said Johnson, sitting in a wheelchair because of bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif.

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Farther along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident that Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence [of the derailment],” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.

At this time, “all hypotheses are open,” Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska said during a news conference. Accident investigators will analyze “the rails at the point where the derailment began and inspect the wheels” of the first train in a laboratory, he added.

The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train belonged to Spain’s public train company, Renfe.

Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and had passed a safety check on Jan. 15.

Puente and Renfe President Álvaro Fernández said that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 155 mph and “human error could be ruled out.”

The accident shook a nation that leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport.

“It is undoubtedly a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Puente told Spanish national radio RNE on Tuesday when asked about the damage to the reputation of the rail system.

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the scene of the accident, where they greeted emergency workers as well as some residents who had helped in the initial stages of the rescue. Afterward, they went to a hospital in Cordoba where many of the injured remain under care.

“We are all responsible for not looking away when the debris of a catastrophe is being cleared away,” Letizia told reporters after the visit.

Spain’s Civil Guard is collecting DNA samples from family members who fear they have loved ones among the unidentified dead.

High-speed trains resumed service Tuesday from Madrid to Sevilla and Malaga, the largest cities in Andalusia, Spain’s most populous region, but passengers had to travel a stretch of the journey by buses provided by the rail service. Puente said normal train service won’t resume until early February.

Spanish airline Iberia added more flights to southern cities until Sunday to help stranded travelers. Some bus companies also reinforced their services in the south.

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

The officer said that the girl had managed to escape from one of the train carriages most affected by the crash, La Vanguardia reported, adding that he did not notice her bare feet until about an hour after initially finding her. She told the officer that she had to take off her shoes before climbing through the broken window, because they had gotten caught between pieces of iron debris inside the carriage when it derailed, according to the newspaper.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.

""There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,"" Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.

Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 41 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.

Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, the town hall said. But The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.

Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.

Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.

""She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,"" the mayor said.","6-year-old girl is sole survivor of family killed in Spanish train wreck, found after escaping through broken window

","The roar was deafening inside the train car as it hurtled off the tracks, then slid down a steep slope, ripping open its frame. And then, amid the twisted metal of the wreckage, the cries of the injured and the silence of the dead.

Surrounded by bodies after the train accident in southern Spain, one little girl somehow emerged virtually unscathed.

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

The officer said that the girl had managed to escape from one of the train carriages most affected by the crash, La Vanguardia reported, adding that he did not notice her bare feet until about an hour after initially finding her. She told the officer that she had to take off her shoes before climbing through the broken window, because they had gotten caught between pieces of iron debris inside the carriage when it derailed, according to the newspaper.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.

""There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,"" Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.

Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 41 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.

Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, the town hall said. But The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.

Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.

Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.

""She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,"" the mayor said."

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.

Sunday’s collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.

“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.

Here’s a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.

34 years

The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.

Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France.

The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.

Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.

3,900 kilometers

The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.

Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.

Spain’s commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.

Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.

7 vs. 2½ hours

The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.

On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.

Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.

The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.

Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.

Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.

“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.

“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”

The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change.

One crash

The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”

Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”

One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.

Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn’t designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.

Three companies

The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.

Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.

The first private company to get into Spain’s high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.

It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it’s working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.

The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.

Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.

The first private company to get into Spain’s high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.

It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it’s working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.

Spain’s high-speed train crash casts a shadow over a world-class rail system
BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.
Sunday’s collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.
“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.
Here’s a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.
34 years
The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.
Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France.
The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.
Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
3,900 kilometers
The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.
Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.
Spain’s commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.
Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.
7 vs. 2½ hours
The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.
On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.
Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.
The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.
Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.
Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.
“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.
“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”
The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change.
One crash
The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”
Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.
Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”
One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.
Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn’t designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident, which took place about 500 miles away, as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said of the 37 people affected by Tuesday’s crash, five were seriously injured. Six others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 20 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash, and that the injured were taken to hospitals in the area. Regional firefighters said most of the injured had ridden in the first train car.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez acknowledged the Barcelona area crash, writing on X: “All my affection and solidarity with the victims and their families.”

While Spain’s high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, and at least until Sunday had been a source of confidence, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues. However, accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, located about 35 minutes outside Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator ADIF said the containment wall most likely collapsed due to heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week. Commuter train service was canceled along the line, it said.

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. (1:45 p.m. ET) when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Málaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif. Authorities were still recovering more bodies on Tuesday.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people had been treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Málaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” Jonsson, sitting in a wheelchair due to bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown, told reporters. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl who survived the wreck was virtually unscathed, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

The mayor of their hometown called her survival a “miracle.”

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Further along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident, which Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.","BARCELONA, Spain — A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing at least one person and injuring 37 others.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Further along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident, which Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.","Create your free profile or log in to save this article

BARCELONA, Spain — A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing at least one person and injuring 37 others.

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident, which took place about 500 miles away, as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said of the 37 people affected by Tuesday’s crash, five were seriously injured. Six others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 20 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash, and that the injured were taken to hospitals in the area. Regional firefighters said most of the injured had ridden in the first train car.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez acknowledged the Barcelona area crash, writing on X: “All my affection and solidarity with the victims and their families.”

While Spain’s high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, and at least until Sunday had been a source of confidence, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues. However, accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, located about 35 minutes outside Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator ADIF said the containment wall most likely collapsed due to heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week. Commuter train service was canceled along the line, it said.

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. (1:45 p.m. ET) when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Málaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif. Authorities were still recovering more bodies on Tuesday.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people had been treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Málaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” Jonsson, sitting in a wheelchair due to bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown, told reporters. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl who survived the wreck was virtually unscathed, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

It comes as investigators are learning more about what might have caused the deadliest crash in the history of the country’s high-speed rail system.

What caused the disaster?

Investigators have found a broken joint in the tracks. It is a key failure point that may have triggered the disaster, according to a report from Reuters.

Reuters reports that a source briefed on the investigation said on-site technicians analyzing the rails identified some wear on the joint between sections of the rail which had “been there for some time.” They say that created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track.

Police say the three rear cars of one train, carrying roughly 300 passengers, jumped the tracks Sunday night and crossed onto the opposite line. It slammed into the front of an oncoming train carrying nearly 200 passengers, causing both trains to flip.

Spanish Transportation Minister Óscar Puente said investigators are trying to determine whether a break in a section of track was “the cause or the consequences” of the derailment, according to a New York Times report. He cautioned that at this time, any theories are just speculation because investigators were still working.

The president of Spain’s Railway Accident Investigation Commission, Íñigo Barrón, said in an interview with Spanish broadcaster RTVE that so far, it does not appear the crash was caused by human error or any problems with the signals.

“What always plays a part in a derailment is the interaction between the track and the vehicle, and that is what the commission is currently [looking into],” he said.

Worst crash in rail line’s history

Spain’s high-speed rail service is relatively young. It took off in 1992, ahead of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Regional authorities said Monday night that 41 people are still hospitalized, 12 of them in intensive care.

Authorities have set up tents to collect DNA samples from families as they work to identify victims and notify relatives. Search and rescue operations are still underway.

It comes as investigators are learning more about what might have caused the deadliest crash in the history of the country’s high-speed rail system.

Investigators have found a broken joint in the tracks. It is a key failure point that may have triggered the disaster, according to a report from Reuters.

Reuters reports that a source briefed on the investigation said on-site technicians analyzing the rails identified some wear on the joint between sections of the rail which had “been there for some time.” They say that created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track.

Police say the three rear cars of one train, carrying roughly 300 passengers, jumped the tracks Sunday night and crossed onto the opposite line. It slammed into the front of an oncoming train carrying nearly 200 passengers, causing both trains to flip.

Spanish Transportation Minister Óscar Puente said investigators are trying to determine whether a break in a section of track was “the cause or the consequences” of the derailment, according to a New York Times report. He cautioned that at this time, any theories are just speculation because investigators were still working.

The president of Spain’s Railway Accident Investigation Commission, Íñigo Barrón, said in an interview with Spanish broadcaster RTVE that so far, it does not appear the crash was caused by human error or any problems with the signals.

“What always plays a part in a derailment is the interaction between the track and the vehicle, and that is what the commission is currently [looking into],” he said.

Spain’s high-speed rail service is relatively young. It took off in 1992, ahead of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

This marks the first deadly crash in the high-speed rail line’s nearly 34-year history.

It is not, however, the worst train crash in Spanish history. In 2013, 80 people were killed when a non-high-speed train derailed."

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.

“There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,” Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.

Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 41 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.

Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, officials said. But The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.

Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.

Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.

“She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,” the mayor said.","The roar was deafening inside the train car as it hurtled off the tracks, then slid down a steep slope, ripping open its frame.

Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.
Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.

Surrounded by bodies after the train accident in southern Spain, one little girl somehow emerged virtually unscathed.

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.

Why it matters: That opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

Why now: Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

Full Story

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Flowers, signs and mementos are seen Monday at a makeshift memorial in the area where Alex Pretti was shot dead by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. On January 24, federal agents shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway. Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images )

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

The Los Angeles Metro Board voted to develop a 14-mile-long subway through the Santa Monica Mountains. It’s one of the first significant steps in what city and county leaders are describing as the region's most consequential transit project and perhaps one of the most important in the country.
The train: The transportation agency’s board approved a route for the train that could see as many as 124,000 rides between the Valley and Westside per day and reduce the total amount people would otherwise travel by car by nearly 800,000 miles a day.
Celebration tempered by words of caution: The historic vote to move the Sepulveda Transit Corridor forward didn’t happen without warnings about funding for the multi-billion dollar project and the need to keep communities engaged throughout the design process.
Read on … to hear more about the train that could one day take you off the 405 Freeway.
The Los Angeles Metro Board unanimously voted Thursday to proceed with developing a 14-mile-long subway under the Santa Monica Mountains. It’s one of the first significant steps in what city and county leaders are describing as the region's most consequential transit project and perhaps one of the most important in the country.
Metro staff said in a report to its board that it has secured funding through county tax measures for about 14% of the $24.2 billion it’s preliminarily estimated to cost to build the route, which will involve extensive tunneling. They added the cost estimate would be updated as further refinements are made, but having this amount of funding secured is “not uncommon” for projects early on in development.
Still, leaders underscored that while the need for a rail link between the Valley and Westside couldn’t be overstated, staff for the countywide transportation agency should remain mindful of financial constraints and push for cost reductions through the next several years before shovels hit the ground.
“Ambition matters, dreaming big matters, but honesty matters too,” L.A. City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky, who also is a member of the Metro Board, said during Thursday’s meeting. “We can't afford to approve transformative projects without being clear about the path to funding and delivery.”
The price tag certainly is “eye-popping” and Metro’s “largest project to date,” as Ray Sosa, the chief planning officer for the agency, recently wrote in an op-ed about the project.
With today’s vote progressing the project, the Metro Board enthusiastically endorsed the investment, for now, in theory.
The project and selected route
The Sepulveda Transit Corridor, as the project is known, was conceived to relieve Angelenos of the sometimes 90-minute drive between the Valley and Westside via the 405 Freeway, provide a crucial artery to connect with other regional rail and bus routes and link residential areas to job centers.
In June 2025, Metro released its draft environmental review of five different subway and monorail options. Of the more than 8,000 public comments Metro received, fewer than 70 expressed opposition to the project as a whole, according to agency staff.
Metro staff in January published its recommendation to move forward with further study of a modified version of one of the subway options.
That’s what the transportation agency’s board approved Thursday.
The route is projected to see as many as 124,000 rides per day and reduce the total amount people would otherwise travel by car by nearly 800,000 miles a day.
An end-to-end trip on the proposed route between Valley and the Westside is slated to take 20 minutes, with trains arriving every 2.5 minutes at peak times.
Station locations for the proposed train would connect to the Metro D, E and East San Fernando Valley rail lines, the Metrolink stop in Van Nuys and also the G bus rapid-transit line. Crucially, the route also will stop at UCLA, which over the years had become a non-negotiable necessity among students and other advocates of the train.
“Higher education deserves to be easily accessible for everyone,” Mariela Diaz, a UCLA commuter student who described herself as low income, said at the meeting Thursday. “Future UCLA students deserve to have their first on-campus station.”
As it’s currently planned, there wouldn’t be a stop providing direct access to the Getty Center, for which the museum had been publicly campaigning.
L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who has a seat on the Metro Board, asked Thursday that agency staff report back on “transportation alternatives to address fast and last-minute connections to the Getty Center.”
Report details economic benefits
A report from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation details how construction would generate as much as $40 billion in economic output and spur more than $16 billion in labor income countywide.
You can read the full report, commissioned by L.A. City Councilmember Nithya Raman’s office, here.
Leaders urge continued engagement and not to compromise on vision
Today’s vote directed Metro staff to focus on the proposed route for forthcoming technical and environmental analyses and clearances, as well as to further refine design and cost estimates.
There also will be continued community engagement.
Yaroslavsky amended the item the board approved Thursday to include language asking Metro staff to, among other tasks, report back on a community engagement plan focused on the communities that might be impacted by tunneling or construction and to maintain a publicly accessible outreach calendar.
Metro’s final environmental documents, which will be the culmination of the continued engagement and study, will be subject to future approval from the board.
When construction starts, the focus will first be on the middle segment of the train running from the G-line stop in Van Nuys to the future D-line stop in Westwood.
The additional segments on the north and south sides of the route would be built afterward.

Big Bear’s famous bald eagle couple, Jackie and Shadow, now have a pair of eggs to look after.
Why now: Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.
Why it matters: More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie laid the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.

Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.
More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie welcomed the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.
The season so far
Jackie laid the first egg around 4:30 p.m. Friday, with Shadow stopping by to see it for the first time about 10 minutes later, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley records.
Jackie tends to lay eggs three days apart, and the second egg arrived right on schedule.
Jackie could be seen rousing and puffing up her feathers about a half-hour before laying the second egg. She made a high-pitched whistling tea kettle noise a little before 5 p.m. Monday.
Officials from Friends of Big Bear Valley have told LAist those behaviors are signs an egg is imminent.
“She looks almost royal, because all of her feathers are out and it's just — I cry,” Jenny Voisard, the organization’s media and website manager, said with a laugh last week. “It's usually pretty amazing.”
The eagle pair typically takes turns caring for their eggs. Shadow visited the nest for nearly three hours across nine incubation “daddy duty” sessions on Sunday, according to organization records.
What’s ahead for the nest
Jackie has laid up to three eggs in a clutch, including in each of the past two seasons, so fans could see another egg arrive this week.
A clutch refers to the group of eggs laid in each nesting attempt. Bald eagles generally have one clutch per season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. A second clutch is possible if the eggs don’t make it through the early incubation process.
For example, Jackie laid a second clutch in February 2021 after the first round of eggs was broken or destroyed by ravens the month before.
The Big Bear eagles also practice delayed incubation, which is when Jackie and Shadow don’t apply their full body heat to the eggs until the whole clutch is laid.
Waiting to incubate full time helps the eggs hatch closer together, making the chicks more similar in size and age, which the organization says gives them a better chance of survival.
Jackie and Shadow successfully delayed incubation for their trio of eggs last season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. Sunny and Gizmohatched and later went on to fledge, or fly away from the nest for the first time, last summer.
Chicks? Chicks soon??
Once egg-laying is over, the chick countdown is on.
Jackie and Shadow's usual incubation time is around 35 to 39 days, starting when the eagles begin to fully incubate their clutch, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley.
Last season, the first egg hatched at around 40 days old, the second egg hatched around 38 days old and the third egg around 39 days old.
“Pip Watch” — short for pipping, which is the first hole an eaglet makes as it emerges from its egg — is typically announced by Friends of Big Bear Valley before chicks break through each season.
Last year’s Pip Watch kicked off in March, a few days before the first chick hatched in the nest.

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights announced a new lawsuit Monday against federal immigration agencies for claims detainees at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center lack basic necessities and medical care.
Who is involved: Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
What they want to change: ”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
A history of issues: In court documents, CHIRLA pointed to reports by government and nonprofit agencies that showed problems in previous years, including a DHS Office of Inspector General report from 2018 that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights announced a new lawsuit Monday against federal immigration agencies for claims of inhumane conditions at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County.
The organization claims people detained in the Adelanto facility lack drinkable water, healthy food, clean clothes, places to sleep and access to medical care. Failing to provide these basic necessities, CHIRLA says in court documents, amounts to punishment — violating detainees rights to due process.
“ We are really at a moment where we are seeing a human rights crisis right before our eyes,” CHIRLA policy director Jeanette Zanipatin said at a news conference Monday. “And the detention centers, especially the one at Adelanto, is where we are seeing it unfold in real time.”
Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
ICE and Homeland Security have not responded to LAist about the case or claims in this article.
A question of constitutional rights
When CHIRLA announced the lawsuit on Monday, Zanipatin said there has been “a long history of unsafe and abusive conditions” at the Adelanto facility. She referenced a July 2025 report from the nonprofit Disability Rights California that found conditions at the facility were “dangerous and inadequate for all people, especially for those with disabilities.”
Court documents filed by CHIRLA also reference previous reports that found issues at the facility, including a 2018 report from the DHS Office of Inspector General that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”
Those issues included findings of nooses in detainees’ cells, improper use of disciplinary segregation and inadequate medical care.
“Based on interviews with detainees and medical staff and a review of independent reports,” the report states, “we concluded that detainees do not have timely access to proper medical care.”
CHIRLA claims in their lawsuit that Adelanto leadership rejected the findings of the inspector general report and took no corrective action.
The concerns raised by CHIRLA as they announced the lawsuit closely resemble the findings of Disability Rights California, which also claimed detainees were not provided adequate medical care, food, water or clean clothing. The organization also reported that some people had limited access to communication with their loved ones.
Huerta claimed that the conditions in the Adelanto facility are poor by design.
“ Adelanto, like most ICE prisons, is engineered to be so punishing, so relentlessly soul crushing, that people abandon their rights and accept deportation even when they have strong asylum claims or a clear pathway to legal status,” Huerta said.
He said 32 people died while detained by ICE nationwide in 2025, and at least 6 more have died in January. Two people died at Adelanto last fall, Huerta said.
Family members speak out
Mariel Garcia told LAist she would call her father, Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, nearly every day. That ended when he was detained by immigration agents in Costa Mesa on Oct. 14.
Garcia-Aviles had a work permit, his daughter said, but he was detained and taken to Adelanto. She said she tried many times to ask the facility staff to allow her to call her father, or even to get an update on his condition, but she was never able to talk to him again.
Worried, she said she got a call from the staff at Adelanto.
“ They called me the day he was passing away,” Garcia told LAist, “They're like, go tell your family and friends to come and say their last goodbyes because your father's in critical condition.”
Her brother, Gabriel Garcia, said that when they arrived at the hospital their father was intubated and “lifeless."" Still, he said, there were law enforcement officers standing outside the hospital room.
Garcia-Aviles died Oct. 23 at age 56.
Jose Ayala also talked about the loss of his brother, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, while he was detained in the Adelanto facility.
“ He was there for about a month and we knew nothing of his condition,” Ayala said at Monday’s press conference, “just that he was sick and that he wasn't getting any help when he asked.”
Ayala said his family learned of his brother’s death when the police came and knocked at their door. He said staff at Adelanto did not tell them Ayala-Uribe had been hospitalized or that he needed a surgery, which ICE said in a news release was for an abscess.
Ayala told LAist that he was able to talk with his brother over the phone a couple of times when he was detained, and Ayala-Uribe was joking with him about the poor conditions of the facility causing him to lose weight.
“ One of the last things he told me,” Ayala recalled, “was, ‘We'll see who comes out skinnier.’”
He said his brother was 39 when he died on Sept. 22, 2025.
CHIRLA alleges in court documents that staff at Adelanto were aware Ayala-Uribe was having a potentially life-threatening medical emergency three days before his death, but he was taken back to his cell after being seen by the facility’s medical team.
An ICE news release said Ayala-Uribe “was evaluated by an on-call medical provider Sept. 18, provided medication, and returned to his dormitory,” but did not mention the severity of his condition.
The cause of both deaths remain under investigation, CHIRLA said in an accompanying news release.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.
Why now: Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.
Why it matters: That opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.
Read on... for what this means for the Friday deadline.
The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.
Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.
But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.
""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""
Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.
Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.
At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.
That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.
""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.
After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.
Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown
The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.
Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.
The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.
""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""
Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.
A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.
""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""
Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.
Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown
Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.
Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.
Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.
But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.
""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""
Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""
Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.
Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.
Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.
The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Timespoll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.
Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake
The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.
Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.
Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.
""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""
Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

Topline:
Ex-Olympian Ryan Wedding appeared in court Monday in Santa Ana where he pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing him of running a billion-dollar drug trafficking ring and orchestrating multiple killings.
Why now: Wedding was taken into custody last week in Mexico City. Mexican officials say he turned himself in at the U.S. Embassy there, according to the Associated Press. But the AP also reported Wedding's lawyer said Monday that he actually did not surrender to law enforcement, but had been living in Mexico and was arrested.
The backstory: Wedding is accused of moving as much as 60 tons of cocaine between various locations in South and North America, and that he used Los Angeles as his primary point of distribution. The charges also tie him to the 2023 killing of two members of a Canadian family as retaliation for a stolen drug shipment, a 2024 killing over a drug debt and the killing of a witness in Colombia who was set to testify against him. Wedding was an Olympic snowboarder with Team Canada during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. He appeared in just one event, the men's parallel giant slalom, where he finished 24th. Last March, Wedding was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list.
What's next: Wedding's trail has tentatively been scheduled to start on March 24.","

The train: The transportation agency’s board approved a route for the train that could see as many as 124,000 rides between the Valley and Westside per day and reduce the total amount people would otherwise travel by car by nearly 800,000 miles a day.
Celebration tempered by words of caution: The historic vote to move the Sepulveda Transit Corridor forward didn’t happen without warnings about funding for the multi-billion dollar project and the need to keep communities engaged throughout the design process.
Read on … to hear more about the train that could one day take you off the 405 Freeway.
The Los Angeles Metro Board unanimously voted Thursday to proceed with developing a 14-mile-long subway under the Santa Monica Mountains. It’s one of the first significant steps in what city and county leaders are describing as the region's most consequential transit project and perhaps one of the most important in the country.
Metro staff said in a report to its board that it has secured funding through county tax measures for about 14% of the $24.2 billion it’s preliminarily estimated to cost to build the route, which will involve extensive tunneling. They added the cost estimate would be updated as further refinements are made, but having this amount of funding secured is “not uncommon” for projects early on in development.
Still, leaders underscored that while the need for a rail link between the Valley and Westside couldn’t be overstated, staff for the countywide transportation agency should remain mindful of financial constraints and push for cost reductions through the next several years before shovels hit the ground.
“Ambition matters, dreaming big matters, but honesty matters too,” L.A. City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky, who also is a member of the Metro Board, said during Thursday’s meeting. “We can't afford to approve transformative projects without being clear about the path to funding and delivery.”
The price tag certainly is “eye-popping” and Metro’s “largest project to date,” as Ray Sosa, the chief planning officer for the agency, recently wrote in an op-ed about the project.
With today’s vote progressing the project, the Metro Board enthusiastically endorsed the investment, for now, in theory.
The project and selected route
The Sepulveda Transit Corridor, as the project is known, was conceived to relieve Angelenos of the sometimes 90-minute drive between the Valley and Westside via the 405 Freeway, provide a crucial artery to connect with other regional rail and bus routes and link residential areas to job centers.
In June 2025, Metro released its draft environmental review of five different subway and monorail options. Of the more than 8,000 public comments Metro received, fewer than 70 expressed opposition to the project as a whole, according to agency staff.
Metro staff in January published its recommendation to move forward with further study of a modified version of one of the subway options.
That’s what the transportation agency’s board approved Thursday.
The route is projected to see as many as 124,000 rides per day and reduce the total amount people would otherwise travel by car by nearly 800,000 miles a day.
An end-to-end trip on the proposed route between Valley and the Westside is slated to take 20 minutes, with trains arriving every 2.5 minutes at peak times.
Station locations for the proposed train would connect to the Metro D, E and East San Fernando Valley rail lines, the Metrolink stop in Van Nuys and also the G bus rapid-transit line. Crucially, the route also will stop at UCLA, which over the years had become a non-negotiable necessity among students and other advocates of the train.
“Higher education deserves to be easily accessible for everyone,” Mariela Diaz, a UCLA commuter student who described herself as low income, said at the meeting Thursday. “Future UCLA students deserve to have their first on-campus station.”
As it’s currently planned, there wouldn’t be a stop providing direct access to the Getty Center, for which the museum had been publicly campaigning.
L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who has a seat on the Metro Board, asked Thursday that agency staff report back on “transportation alternatives to address fast and last-minute connections to the Getty Center.”
Report details economic benefits
A report from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation details how construction would generate as much as $40 billion in economic output and spur more than $16 billion in labor income countywide.
You can read the full report, commissioned by L.A. City Councilmember Nithya Raman’s office, here.
Leaders urge continued engagement and not to compromise on vision
Today’s vote directed Metro staff to focus on the proposed route for forthcoming technical and environmental analyses and clearances, as well as to further refine design and cost estimates.
There also will be continued community engagement.
Yaroslavsky amended the item the board approved Thursday to include language asking Metro staff to, among other tasks, report back on a community engagement plan focused on the communities that might be impacted by tunneling or construction and to maintain a publicly accessible outreach calendar.
Metro’s final environmental documents, which will be the culmination of the continued engagement and study, will be subject to future approval from the board.
When construction starts, the focus will first be on the middle segment of the train running from the G-line stop in Van Nuys to the future D-line stop in Westwood.
The additional segments on the north and south sides of the route would be built afterward.

Big Bear’s famous bald eagle couple, Jackie and Shadow, now have a pair of eggs to look after.
Why now: Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.
Why it matters: More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie laid the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.
Big Bear’s famous bald eagle couple, Jackie and Shadow, now have a pair of eggs to look after.
Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.
More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie welcomed the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.
The season so far
Jackie laid the first egg around 4:30 p.m. Friday, with Shadow stopping by to see it for the first time about 10 minutes later, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley records.
Jackie tends to lay eggs three days apart, and the second egg arrived right on schedule.
Jackie could be seen rousing and puffing up her feathers about a half-hour before laying the second egg. She made a high-pitched whistling tea kettle noise a little before 5 p.m. Monday.
Officials from Friends of Big Bear Valley have told LAist those behaviors are signs an egg is imminent.
“She looks almost royal, because all of her feathers are out and it's just — I cry,” Jenny Voisard, the organization’s media and website manager, said with a laugh last week. “It's usually pretty amazing.”
The eagle pair typically takes turns caring for their eggs. Shadow visited the nest for nearly three hours across nine incubation “daddy duty” sessions on Sunday, according to organization records.
What’s ahead for the nest
Jackie has laid up to three eggs in a clutch, including in each of the past two seasons, so fans could see another egg arrive this week.
A clutch refers to the group of eggs laid in each nesting attempt. Bald eagles generally have one clutch per season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. A second clutch is possible if the eggs don’t make it through the early incubation process.
For example, Jackie laid a second clutch in February 2021 after the first round of eggs was broken or destroyed by ravens the month before.
The Big Bear eagles also practice delayed incubation, which is when Jackie and Shadow don’t apply their full body heat to the eggs until the whole clutch is laid.
Waiting to incubate full time helps the eggs hatch closer together, making the chicks more similar in size and age, which the organization says gives them a better chance of survival.
Jackie and Shadow successfully delayed incubation for their trio of eggs last season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. Sunny and Gizmohatched and later went on to fledge, or fly away from the nest for the first time, last summer.
Chicks? Chicks soon??
Once egg-laying is over, the chick countdown is on.
Jackie and Shadow's usual incubation time is around 35 to 39 days, starting when the eagles begin to fully incubate their clutch, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley.
Last season, the first egg hatched at around 40 days old, the second egg hatched around 38 days old and the third egg around 39 days old.
“Pip Watch” — short for pipping, which is the first hole an eaglet makes as it emerges from its egg — is typically announced by Friends of Big Bear Valley before chicks break through each season.
Last year’s Pip Watch kicked off in March, a few days before the first chick hatched in the nest.

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights announced a new lawsuit Monday against federal immigration agencies for claims detainees at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center lack basic necessities and medical care.
Who is involved: Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
What they want to change: ”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
A history of issues: In court documents, CHIRLA pointed to reports by government and nonprofit agencies that showed problems in previous years, including a DHS Office of Inspector General report from 2018 that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights announced a new lawsuit Monday against federal immigration agencies for claims of inhumane conditions at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County.
The organization claims people detained in the Adelanto facility lack drinkable water, healthy food, clean clothes, places to sleep and access to medical care. Failing to provide these basic necessities, CHIRLA says in court documents, amounts to punishment — violating detainees rights to due process.
“ We are really at a moment where we are seeing a human rights crisis right before our eyes,” CHIRLA policy director Jeanette Zanipatin said at a news conference Monday. “And the detention centers, especially the one at Adelanto, is where we are seeing it unfold in real time.”
Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
ICE and Homeland Security have not responded to LAist about the case or claims in this article.
A question of constitutional rights
When CHIRLA announced the lawsuit on Monday, Zanipatin said there has been “a long history of unsafe and abusive conditions” at the Adelanto facility. She referenced a July 2025 report from the nonprofit Disability Rights California that found conditions at the facility were “dangerous and inadequate for all people, especially for those with disabilities.”
Court documents filed by CHIRLA also reference previous reports that found issues at the facility, including a 2018 report from the DHS Office of Inspector General that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”
Those issues included findings of nooses in detainees’ cells, improper use of disciplinary segregation and inadequate medical care.
“Based on interviews with detainees and medical staff and a review of independent reports,” the report states, “we concluded that detainees do not have timely access to proper medical care.”
CHIRLA claims in their lawsuit that Adelanto leadership rejected the findings of the inspector general report and took no corrective action.
The concerns raised by CHIRLA as they announced the lawsuit closely resemble the findings of Disability Rights California, which also claimed detainees were not provided adequate medical care, food, water or clean clothing. The organization also reported that some people had limited access to communication with their loved ones.
Huerta claimed that the conditions in the Adelanto facility are poor by design.
“ Adelanto, like most ICE prisons, is engineered to be so punishing, so relentlessly soul crushing, that people abandon their rights and accept deportation even when they have strong asylum claims or a clear pathway to legal status,” Huerta said.
He said 32 people died while detained by ICE nationwide in 2025, and at least 6 more have died in January. Two people died at Adelanto last fall, Huerta said.
Family members speak out
Mariel Garcia told LAist she would call her father, Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, nearly every day. That ended when he was detained by immigration agents in Costa Mesa on Oct. 14.
Garcia-Aviles had a work permit, his daughter said, but he was detained and taken to Adelanto. She said she tried many times to ask the facility staff to allow her to call her father, or even to get an update on his condition, but she was never able to talk to him again.
Worried, she said she got a call from the staff at Adelanto.
“ They called me the day he was passing away,” Garcia told LAist, “They're like, go tell your family and friends to come and say their last goodbyes because your father's in critical condition.”
Her brother, Gabriel Garcia, said that when they arrived at the hospital their father was intubated and “lifeless."" Still, he said, there were law enforcement officers standing outside the hospital room.
Garcia-Aviles died Oct. 23 at age 56.
Jose Ayala also talked about the loss of his brother, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, while he was detained in the Adelanto facility.
“ He was there for about a month and we knew nothing of his condition,” Ayala said at Monday’s press conference, “just that he was sick and that he wasn't getting any help when he asked.”
Ayala said his family learned of his brother’s death when the police came and knocked at their door. He said staff at Adelanto did not tell them Ayala-Uribe had been hospitalized or that he needed a surgery, which ICE said in a news release was for an abscess.
Ayala told LAist that he was able to talk with his brother over the phone a couple of times when he was detained, and Ayala-Uribe was joking with him about the poor conditions of the facility causing him to lose weight.
“ One of the last things he told me,” Ayala recalled, “was, ‘We'll see who comes out skinnier.’”
He said his brother was 39 when he died on Sept. 22, 2025.
CHIRLA alleges in court documents that staff at Adelanto were aware Ayala-Uribe was having a potentially life-threatening medical emergency three days before his death, but he was taken back to his cell after being seen by the facility’s medical team.
An ICE news release said Ayala-Uribe “was evaluated by an on-call medical provider Sept. 18, provided medication, and returned to his dormitory,” but did not mention the severity of his condition.
The cause of both deaths remain under investigation, CHIRLA said in an accompanying news release.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.
Why now: Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.
Why it matters: That opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.
Read on... for what this means for the Friday deadline.
The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.
Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.
But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.
""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""
Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.
Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.
At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.
That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.
""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.
After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.
Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown
The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.
Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.
The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.
""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""
Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.
A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.
""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""
Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.
Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown
Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.
Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.
Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.
But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.
""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""
Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""
Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.
Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.
Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.
The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Timespoll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.
Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake
The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.
Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.
Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.
""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""
Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

Topline:
Ex-Olympian Ryan Wedding appeared in court Monday in Santa Ana where he pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing him of running a billion-dollar drug trafficking ring and orchestrating multiple killings.
Why now: Wedding was taken into custody last week in Mexico City. Mexican officials say he turned himself in at the U.S. Embassy there, according to the Associated Press. But the AP also reported Wedding's lawyer said Monday that he actually did not surrender to law enforcement, but had been living in Mexico and was arrested.
The backstory: Wedding is accused of moving as much as 60 tons of cocaine between various locations in South and North America, and that he used Los Angeles as his primary point of distribution. The charges also tie him to the 2023 killing of two members of a Canadian family as retaliation for a stolen drug shipment, a 2024 killing over a drug debt and the killing of a witness in Colombia who was set to testify against him. Wedding was an Olympic snowboarder with Team Canada during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. He appeared in just one event, the men's parallel giant slalom, where he finished 24th. Last March, Wedding was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list.
What's next: Wedding's trail has tentatively been scheduled to start on March 24.","

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

The crash took place near Adamuz in the southern Andalusia region late Sunday night, when a high-speed train operated by private rail company Iryo, going to Madrid from Malaga, derailed, straying into the path of an oncoming train operated by Spain's public Renfe network, which also derailed.

The cause of the crash remains a mystery, though investigators say they will focus on coach six of the Iryo train, which they believe was the first to derail. The Guardia Civil national police force asked for that carriage to be left where it came to a rest so it can be examined.

Rail experts ""extremely surprised"" by crash on straight track

""There are many pieces of the puzzle we must fit together,"" Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente told the country's Onda Cero radio network Tuesday.

Puente called the crash ""extremely strange"" on Monday because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May, adding that ""all the railway experts are extremely surprised.""

""Nothing seems to suggest anything was wrong with it,"" he said Tuesday. ""Three trains passed 20 minutes before ... ""When I say that the accident is strange, it couldn't be stranger.""

Investigators studying the scene of the accident found a broken joint on the rails, which likely created a gap that widened as trains passed over it, the Reuters news agency said Tuesday, citing a source briefed on the initial investigation. The faulty joint could prove key to determining the cause of the accident, the source said.

Puente, however, warned against drawing any conclusions based on ""mere speculation.""

""When the train went off the rails, it produced a ton of fractures in the track, for about 200 meters [yards]. And so for the first fracture in the track, the key is to determine — and currently no expert can say for certain — if this fracture was a cause or a consequence,"" he told Onda Cero.

""That is the crux of this whole thing, or one of them, knowing what came first — the fracturing of the track and then the derailment, or if the derailment caused the fracture in the track,"" Puente said, adding that if there was an issue with the track before the crash, investigators would still ""have to find out why.""

Spain's chief high-speed train engineer Álvaro Aznar told CBS News on Monday that the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash, but authorities have stressed that it could take weeks, if not longer, to know for sure.

Officials have ruled out sabotage and human error, saying both trains were travelling under the speed limit for the section of track.

""The possibility of sabotage was never considered,"" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a press conference following a weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""There has never been any element suggesting otherwise.""

Spain's worst train accident in recent times occurred in 2013 when 80 people died after a train derailed in the northwest of the country. Investigators found that the train was traveling 111 mph in a 50 mph zone when it left the tracks.

Death toll could still climb as recovery work continues

Local residents were among the first on the scene of the crash Sunday night.

""There were people with missing limbs,"" said Gonzalo Sanchez, who shuttled survivors to safety on his four-wheeler. ""They were crying. Nobody was born to see this.""

""I think we did all we could,"" another Adamuz resident, who identified himself only as Antonio, told the El Pais newspaper. ""The sad thing is we couldn't do more.""

The death toll from the accident climbed to 41 on Monday evening after the body of another passenger was found in one of the Iryo train carriages, according to the the regional government.

More than 120 people were injured and 39, including four children, were still hospitalized on Tuesday as the nation began three days of mourning.

Across the country, public buildings flew flags at half-mast, while television anchors wore black, and cabinet ministers cut back public appearances.

Rescue crews began using heavy machinery to lift some of the worst damaged train coaches off the damaged section of track on Monday, to give better access to the site.

Juan Manuel Moreno, the head of the Andalusia region's government, said Monday that it would take another 24-48 hours ""to know with certainty how many deaths have resulted from this terrible accident.""

Around 35 families were still desperately waiting for news of missing loved ones on Monday, Fran Vicente, a Red Cross psychologist, told El Pais, saying: ""What they're suffering is brutal.""

The crash took place near Adamuz in the southern Andalusia region late Sunday night, when a high-speed train operated by private rail company Iryo, going to Madrid from Malaga, derailed, straying into the path of an oncoming train operated by Spain's public Renfe network, which also derailed.

The cause of the crash remains a mystery, though investigators say they will focus on coach six of the Iryo train, which they believe was the first to derail. The Guardia Civil national police force asked for that carriage to be left where it came to a rest so it can be examined.

Rail experts ""extremely surprised"" by crash on straight track

""There are many pieces of the puzzle we must fit together,"" Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente told the country's Onda Cero radio network Tuesday.

Puente called the crash ""extremely strange"" on Monday because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May, adding that ""all the railway experts are extremely surprised.""

""Nothing seems to suggest anything was wrong with it,"" he said Tuesday. ""Three trains passed 20 minutes before ... ""When I say that the accident is strange, it couldn't be stranger.""

Investigators studying the scene of the accident found a broken joint on the rails, which likely created a gap that widened as trains passed over it, the Reuters news agency said Tuesday, citing a source briefed on the initial investigation. The faulty joint could prove key to determining the cause of the accident, the source said.

Puente, however, warned against drawing any conclusions based on ""mere speculation.""

""When the train went off the rails, it produced a ton of fractures in the track, for about 200 meters [yards]. And so for the first fracture in the track, the key is to determine — and currently no expert can say for certain — if this fracture was a cause or a consequence,"" he told Onda Cero.

""That is the crux of this whole thing, or one of them, knowing what came first — the fracturing of the track and then the derailment, or if the derailment caused the fracture in the track,"" Puente said, adding that if there was an issue with the track before the crash, investigators would still ""have to find out why.""

Spain's chief high-speed train engineer Álvaro Aznar told CBS News on Monday that the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash, but authorities have stressed that it could take weeks, if not longer, to know for sure.

Officials have ruled out sabotage and human error, saying both trains were travelling under the speed limit for the section of track.

""The possibility of sabotage was never considered,"" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a press conference following a weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""There has never been any element suggesting otherwise.""

Spain's worst train accident in recent times occurred in 2013 when 80 people died after a train derailed in the northwest of the country. Investigators found that the train was traveling 111 mph in a 50 mph zone when it left the tracks.

Death toll could still climb as recovery work continues

Local residents were among the first on the scene of the crash Sunday night.

""There were people with missing limbs,"" said Gonzalo Sanchez, who shuttled survivors to safety on his four-wheeler. ""They were crying. Nobody was born to see this.""

""I think we did all we could,"" another Adamuz resident, who identified himself only as Antonio, told the El Pais newspaper. ""The sad thing is we couldn't do more.""

The death toll from the accident climbed to 41 on Monday evening after the body of another passenger was found in one of the Iryo train carriages, according to the the regional government.

More than 120 people were injured and 39, including four children, were still hospitalized on Tuesday as the nation began three days of mourning.

Across the country, public buildings flew flags at half-mast, while television anchors wore black, and cabinet ministers cut back public appearances.

Rescue crews began using heavy machinery to lift some of the worst damaged train coaches off the damaged section of track on Monday, to give better access to the site.

Juan Manuel Moreno, the head of the Andalusia region's government, said Monday that it would take another 24-48 hours ""to know with certainty how many deaths have resulted from this terrible accident.""

","A commuter train hit a collapsed retaining wall near Barcelona on Tuesday, killing one person and injuring at least 37 people, according to officials in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain.

Juanma Moreno, the president of Andalusia, the southern Spanish region where the accident happened, confirmed the new death toll in an afternoon press conference. Efforts to recover the bodies from the two wrecked train cars continued, he added.

The impact tossed the second train's lead carriages off the track, sending them plummeting down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno said earlier in the day, describing the wreckage as a ""mass of twisted metal"" with bodies likely still to be found inside. Some passengers were catapulted through windows and their bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno previously said.

The crash occurred Sunday at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.

The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said, adding that it appeared the largest number of the deaths occurred in those carriages.

Authorities said all the survivors had been rescued in the early morning.

Moreno said Monday morning that emergency services were still searching what he described as a mass of twisted metal where the smashed carriages had derailed.

""It is likely (that there will be more dead people found) when you look at the mass of metal that is there. The firefighters have done a great job, but unfortunately when they get the heavy machinery to lift the carriages it is probable we will find more victims.""

""Here at ground zero, when you look at this mass of twisted iron, you see the violence of the impact.""

Video and photos showed twisted train cars lying on their sides under floodlights. Passengers reported climbing out of smashed windows, with some using emergency hammers to break the windows, according to Salvador Jiménez, a journalist for Spanish broadcaster RTVE, who was on board one of the derailed trains.

He told the network by phone Sunday that ""there was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed.""

Spanish police said 159 people were injured. Andalusia's regional emergency services said 41 people remained hospitalized on Monday, 12 of whom were in intensive care units. Another 81 passengers were discharged by late Monday afternoon, authorities said.

The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about about 230 miles south of Madrid.

In Adamuz, a sports center was turned into a makeshift hospital and the Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. Members of Spain's civil guard and civil defense worked on site throughout the night.

Spain's chief high-speed train engineer, Álvaro Aznar, told CBS News the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash.

Puente called the crash ""a truly strange"" incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the private company Iryo while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, was part of Spain's public train company Renfe.

When asked by reporters how long an inquiry into the crash's cause could take, he said it could be a month.

Spain has the largest high-speed rail network in Europe for trains moving over 155 mph, with more than 1,900 miles of track, according to the European Union.

The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024.

Train services between Madrid and cities in Andalusia were canceled for Monday.

King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain said Sunday they were ""following with great concern the serious accident between two high-speed trains in Adamuz.""

""We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,"" the royal palace said on X.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X that she was following ""the terrible news"" from Cordoba.

""Tonight you are in my thoughts,"" she wrote in Spanish.

Spanish police said Monday that at least 40 people are confirmed dead in a high-speed train collision the previous night in the south of the country, as efforts to recover the bodies continue with authorities expecting the death toll to rise.Juanma Moreno, the president of Andalusia, the southern Spanish region where the accident happened, confirmed the new death toll in an afternoon press conference. Efforts to recover the bodies from the two wrecked train cars continued, he added.The impact tossed the second train's lead carriages off the track, sending them plummeting down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno said earlier in the day, describing the wreckage as a ""mass of twisted metal"" with bodies likely still to be found inside. Some passengers were catapulted through windows and their bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno previously said.  The crash occurred Sunday at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif. The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said, adding that it appeared the largest number of the deaths occurred in those carriages.


Authorities said all the survivors had been rescued in the early morning.

Moreno said Monday morning that emergency services were still searching what he described as a mass of twisted metal where the smashed carriages had derailed. ""It is likely (that there will be more dead people found) when you look at the mass of metal that is there. The firefighters have done a great job, but unfortunately when they get the heavy machinery to lift the carriages it is probable we will find more victims."" ""Here at ground zero, when you look at this mass of twisted iron, you see the violence of the impact."" 


Video and photos showed twisted train cars lying on their sides under floodlights. Passengers reported climbing out of smashed windows, with some using emergency hammers to break the windows, according to Salvador Jiménez, a journalist for Spanish broadcaster RTVE, who was on board one of the derailed trains. He told the network by phone Sunday that ""there was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed.""Spanish police said 159 people were injured. Andalusia's regional emergency services said 41 people remained hospitalized on Monday, 12 of whom were in intensive care units. Another 81 passengers were discharged by late Monday afternoon, authorities said. The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about about 230 miles south of Madrid. In Adamuz, a sports center was turned into a makeshift hospital and the Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. Members of Spain's civil guard and civil defense worked on site throughout the night.Spain's chief high-speed train engineer, Álvaro Aznar, told CBS News the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash.Puente called the crash ""a truly strange"" incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the private company Iryo while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, was part of Spain's public train company Renfe. 


When asked by reporters how long an inquiry into the crash's cause could take, he said it could be a month. Spain has the largest high-speed rail network in Europe for trains moving over 155 mph, with more than 1,900 miles of track, according to the European Union. The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024. Train services between Madrid and cities in Andalusia were canceled for Monday.King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain said Sunday they were ""following with great concern the serious accident between two high-speed trains in Adamuz.""""We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,"" the royal palace said on X.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X that she was following ""the terrible news"" from Cordoba.

Visiting Las Vegas, Nevada, is a regular occurrence for many Southern California residents. Whether it's a road trip to experience some of the more family-friendly attractions or a long weekend for a bachelor/bachelorette party, few are strangers to Sin City. The only drag is the (typically) four-hour drive it takes to get there if you're venturing from the Los Angeles area. Flying is easily the quickest mode of transportation, with a typical flight not taking much longer than an hour, but getting through airport traffic, TSA, and waiting to take off, you might as well drive.

You could take a train, but a five-hour train ride is worse than four hours in a car. With no high-speed rail to speak of, those are the only options. However, for six years, Brightline West has been working to make a high-speed train from L.A., California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, a reality, and now there's an end date in sight. It won't be complete until late 2029, which is worse than the original 2028 projection, but to have a train that can travel 200 mph — significantly faster than any Amtrak trains – and get passengers to Sin City in roughly two hours, it will be a welcome wait.

Brightline West's all-electric train will travel on a 218-mile track that will connect to Metrolink's system that traverses the downtown Los Angeles area, but the flagship station will be in Las Vegas. There will be additional stations in Apple Valley, Hesperia, and Rancho Cucamonga.

The history of this high-speed rail

Brightline is a well-known company name around Central and South Florida, as its trains run daily from Miami to Orlando. In 2018, it bought the company Express West, opening up a pathway for Brightline to make its debut on the West Coast. California approved a rail line that would travel from Victorville, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2020, which Brightline West would oversee. Unfortunately, Covid-19 forced the company to push construction back to 2022, pushing the U.S. further behind the rest of the world in high-speed rail.

Then, in 2023, the Federal Department of Transportation decided to help get the ball rolling and awarded $3 billion to Brightline West. Former President Joe Biden even visited the site where the flagship station in Vegas will be to say, ""It's on track to be completed by the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles,"" per Fox5 Las Vegas on YouTube.

Brightline West finally broke ground in 2024 and spent 2025 conducting field work to prepare maintenance facilities, as well as the median along Interstate 15, where the rail will be positioned. As of 2026, the parking structure for the Vegas station is well underway, with a good chunk of it completed. Once the company finally has the median of the I-15 and the land around it prepared, it will be able to place the rail.

It won't be complete until late 2029, which is worse than the original 2028 projection, but to have a train that can travel 200 mph — significantly faster than any Amtrak trains – and get passengers to Sin City in roughly two hours, it will be a welcome wait.

Brightline West's all-electric train will travel on a 218-mile track that will connect to Metrolink's system that traverses the downtown Los Angeles area, but the flagship station will be in Las Vegas. There will be additional stations in Apple Valley, Hesperia, and Rancho Cucamonga.

The history of this high-speed rail

Brightline is a well-known company name around Central and South Florida, as its trains run daily from Miami to Orlando. In 2018, it bought the company Express West, opening up a pathway for Brightline to make its debut on the West Coast. California approved a rail line that would travel from Victorville, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2020, which Brightline West would oversee. Unfortunately, Covid-19 forced the company to push construction back to 2022, pushing the U.S. further behind the rest of the world in high-speed rail.

Then, in 2023, the Federal Department of Transportation decided to help get the ball rolling and awarded $3 billion to Brightline West. Former President Joe Biden even visited the site where the flagship station in Vegas will be to say, ""It's on track to be completed by the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles,"" per Fox5 Las Vegas on YouTube.

Brightline West finally broke ground in 2024 and spent 2025 conducting field work to prepare maintenance facilities, as well as the median along Interstate 15, where the rail will be positioned. As of 2026, the parking structure for the Vegas station is well underway, with a good chunk of it completed. Once the company finally has the median of the I-15 and the land around it prepared, it will be able to place the rail.

Visiting Las Vegas, Nevada, is a regular occurrence for many Southern California residents. Whether it's a road trip to experience some of the more family-friendly attractions or a long weekend for a bachelor/bachelorette party, few are strangers to Sin City. The only drag is the (typically) four-hour drive it takes to get there if you're venturing from the Los Angeles area. Flying is easily the quickest mode of transportation, with a typical flight not taking much longer than an hour, but getting through airport traffic, TSA, and waiting to take off, you might as well drive.

Sunday's collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.
“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.
Here's a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.
34 years
The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.
Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France.
The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.
Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
3,900 kilometers
The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.
Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.
Spain's commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.
Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.
7 vs. 2½ hours
The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.
On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.
Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.
The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.
Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.
Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.
“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.
“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”
The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change.
One crash
The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”
Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.
Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”
One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.
Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn't designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.
Three companies
The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.
Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.
The first private company to get into Spain's high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.
It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it's working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.
This story has been corrected to show that Ouigo was the first private company to operate a high-speed train, not Iryo.","

The official death toll from Sunday’s accident rose to 41 by late Monday, the head of Andalucia's regional government, Juan Manuel Moreno, said.

But officials warned that that count may not be definitive, with emergency workers still probing for bodies among what Moreno called ""a twisted mass of metal.""

Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Spanish national television RTVE late on Monday that search teams believe they have found three more bodies still trapped in the wreckage. Those bodies are not included in the official count, the minister said.

The crash happened at 7:45 pm on Sunday when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails.

It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.

The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a 4-metre slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of metres from the crash site, Moreno said.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the incident that Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente has called ""strange"" since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

But Puente said late on Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.

""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the accident site near the town of Adamuz on Monday, where he declared three days of mourning with flags lowered on all public buildings and navy vessels.

Paramedics rushed the severely injured pedestrian to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The driver involved in the crash stayed at the scene and cooperated with authorities.

The incident remains under investigation.

Sweet Lawyers extends its heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of the man who lost his life in this tragic incident. We hope they find comfort and strength during this difficult time.

When a Fatal Accident Changes Life Forever

Losing a loved one in a sudden crash is devastating. The grief can feel overwhelming, and for many families, that emotional pain is compounded by unexpected financial pressures—medical bills, funeral expenses, and the loss of income or support your loved one once provided.

In moments like these, it’s important to know that you are not alone. A wrongful death claim can help families find a sense of justice and financial stability after an unimaginable loss. While no legal action can ever replace the person you’ve lost, it can provide accountability and help protect your family’s future.

Wrongful death claims can help families recover compensation for:

Funeral and burial expenses

Medical costs related to final care

Lost income and future financial support

Loss of companionship and emotional suffering

Beyond financial relief, pursuing a claim is often about accountability. Whether a crash was caused by distracted driving, speeding, or another form of negligence, holding the responsible party accountable can help bring closure and reduce the risk of similar tragedies happening to others.

At Sweet Lawyers, we understand how overwhelming this time can be. Our experienced wrongful death and personal injury attorneys have spent decades supporting families through some of life’s most difficult moments. We approach every case with care, respect, and a deep commitment to justice.

We take on the legal burden so you can focus on what matters most—healing, honoring your loved one’s memory, and finding peace.

You don’t have to carry this weight alone. If your loved one was killed in a car accident, contact Sweet Lawyers at (800) 674-7852 for a free, confidential consultation.

We’re available 24/7, ready to listen, guide you through your options, and fight for the justice your family deserves.","74-Year-Old Pedestrian Killed in Early-Morning Beverly Grove Crash

“One Battle After Another” has been the favorite since the season’s first poll, lo those many months ago. Bolstered by its long string of critics’ group wins, it’s now a consensus pick, one of many in Round 3. “Hamnet” and “Sinners” have been in the second and third positions that whole time, with the rest of the field vacillating wildly behind them. “Marty Supreme” has to be the hottest contender, with “Frankenstein” and “Train Dreams” confidently taking up favored positions. Among international contenders, “The Secret Agent’s” momentum culminated in foreign-language film wins at LAFCA, CCA and the reconstituted Globes. However …

It’s our perennial duty to point out that the critics’ groups have virtually no overlap with the academy. The Globes have been particularly poor at matching the eventual best -picture winner, scoring just under 50% over the last 35 years in that regard. So take “Battle’s” one-win-after-another season so far with a grain of salt.

Still, the drama for the panelists seems to be about which less-ballyhooed contenders might squeak out noms: “For a surprise pick, I’d edge toward ‘Blue Moon’ sneaking in,” says Robert Daniels. “I’m thinking we could see three foreign-language entries here for the first time ever,” opines Dave Karger. And Katie Walsh writes, “Taking a little bit of a swing here, and subbing in Spain’s Oscar entry ‘Sirāt’ for ‘Avatar.’”

When this awards season started, who would have pegged neither the “Avatar” nor the “Wicked” sequel to make the projected nominees list?

The Globes have been particularly poor at matching the eventual best -picture winner, scoring just under 50% over the last 35 years in that regard. So take “Battle’s” one-win-after-another season so far with a grain of salt.

Still, the drama for the panelists seems to be about which less-ballyhooed contenders might squeak out noms: “For a surprise pick, I’d edge toward ‘Blue Moon’ sneaking in,” says Robert Daniels. “I’m thinking we could see three foreign-language entries here for the first time ever,” opines Dave Karger. And Katie Walsh writes, “Taking a little bit of a swing here, and subbing in Spain’s Oscar entry ‘Sirāt’ for ‘Avatar.’”

When this awards season started, who would have pegged neither the “Avatar” nor the “Wicked” sequel to make the projected nominees list?

Elizabeth Taylor was born in London to a prominent American couple, grew up in Los Angeles, became a film star at an early age and eventually married U.S. Sen. John Warner, among others.

It was about 70 years ago that Hudson and Taylor, along with other actors, converged on a small town in Albemarle County to film the movie “Giant,” based on a novel that was published in 1952.

The movie opens with a bucolic scene of horses roaming through the countryside as a train, with Hudson on board, arrives at the station in Keswick, located just a few miles east of Charlottesville. The old station in rural Albemarle County was standing in for Ardmore, an unincorporated part of Prince George’s County, Maryland, that was part of the novel.

“The majestic, rolling green-hilled pastures of the area (with white picket fences) were lovingly viewed as his train pulled into the station at Ardmore,” according to filmsite.org of the movie, which also starred James Dean.

Jordan “Bick” Benedict Jr. (Hudson), after being picked up at the station, is the passenger in a car when he spots socialite Leslie Lynnton (Taylor) riding one of the horses through the countryside. He is smitten (for Taylor, and maybe the horse, who knows) and turns out the driver of the car is the father of Taylor’s character.

“That sure is a beautiful animal,” says Hudson.

The building in Keswick is no longer a train station, but has been used in the past as a school. It closed as a train station in 1967, according to piedmontsub.com.

The plot of the movie is that Hudson’s character is a rich farmer in Texas who comes to Maryland to buy a prized horse – and he meets the Taylor character on the trip. They marry, move back to a large ranch in Texas, where minority workers are not treated well and all kinds of drama ensues.

The movie was released on Oct. 10, 1956, in New York City. (On the same day, the New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in Brooklyn in the seventh and deciding game of the World Series.)

The film, in 2005, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally historically or aesthetically significant.”

The other huge star in the movie was Indiana native Dean (the “Rebel Without a Cause” star), who died in a car accident at the age of 24 in California just a few months after filming and prior to the release of “Giant.” Another star was Dennis Hopper, who was also a filmmaker and photographer.

One of the minor actors was Jane Withers, who was born in Atlanta nearly 100 years ago – on April 12, 1926. She passed in 2021, while New York City native Sal Mineo, who also appeared in “Giant,” died about 50 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1976.

Amazingly, some of the less-known actors in the film are still alive, according to Wikipedia: Carroll Baker, 94, who was born in 1931 in Johnstown, Pa., and Elsa Cardenas, 93, who was born in Mexico.

“Carroll Baker was born into a Catholic family, the daughter of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, a traveling salesman,” according to mabumbe.com. “Of Irish and Polish descent, Baker faced early challenges when her parents separated when she was eight years old, leading her, her mother, and younger sister to relocate to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Despite financial hardships, Baker was active in her school’s debate team, marching band, and musicals during her time at Greensburg Salem High School. At 18, the family moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she attended St. Petersburg Junior College. Her early experiences as a magician’s assistant and professional dancer laid the foundation for her future in the performing arts.”

Soon after, she moved to New York City to launch her career.

The movie is noted, by some sources, as having several gay actors, including Hudson, though that was not common knowledge during the 1950s. Hudson was born Nov. 17, 1925 and died in 1985. Taylor, married to Warner from 1976-82, passed in Los Angeles in 2011 at the age of 79.","Rock Hudson was born in Illinois just over 100 years ago and became one of the leading men among Hollywood actors.

The other huge star in the movie was Indiana native Dean (the “Rebel Without a Cause” star), who died in a car accident at the age of 24 in California just a few months after filming and prior to the release of “Giant.” Another star was Dennis Hopper, who was also a filmmaker and photographer.

One of the minor actors was Jane Withers, who was born in Atlanta nearly 100 years ago – on April 12, 1926. She passed in 2021, while New York City native Sal Mineo, who also appeared in “Giant,” died about 50 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1976.

Amazingly, some of the less-known actors in the film are still alive, according to Wikipedia: Carroll Baker, 94, who was born in 1931 in Johnstown, Pa., and Elsa Cardenas, 93, who was born in Mexico.

“Carroll Baker was born into a Catholic family, the daughter of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, a traveling salesman,” according to mabumbe.com. “Of Irish and Polish descent, Baker faced early challenges when her parents separated when she was eight years old, leading her, her mother, and younger sister to relocate to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Despite financial hardships, Baker was active in her school’s debate team, marching band, and musicals during her time at Greensburg Salem High School. At 18, the family moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she attended St. Petersburg Junior College. Her early experiences as a magician’s assistant and professional dancer laid the foundation for her future in the performing arts.”

Soon after, she moved to New York City to launch her career.

The movie is noted, by some sources, as having several gay actors, including Hudson, though that was not common knowledge during the 1950s. Hudson was born Nov. 17, 1925 and died in 1985. Taylor, married to Warner from 1976-82, passed in Los Angeles in 2011 at the age of 79.","Rock Hudson was born in Illinois just over 100 years ago and became one of the leading men among Hollywood actors.

Elizabeth Taylor was born in London to a prominent American couple, grew up in Los Angeles, became a film star at an early age and eventually married U.S. Sen. John Warner, among others.

It was about 70 years ago that Hudson and Taylor, along with other actors, converged on a small town in Albemarle County to film the movie “Giant,” based on a novel that was published in 1952.

The movie opens with a bucolic scene of horses roaming through the countryside as a train, with Hudson on board, arrives at the station in Keswick, located just a few miles east of Charlottesville. The old station in rural Albemarle County was standing in for Ardmore, an unincorporated part of Prince George’s County, Maryland, that was part of the novel.

“The majestic, rolling green-hilled pastures of the area (with white picket fences) were lovingly viewed as his train pulled into the station at Ardmore,” according to filmsite.org of the movie, which also starred James Dean.

Jordan “Bick” Benedict Jr. (Hudson), after being picked up at the station, is the passenger in a car when he spots socialite Leslie Lynnton (Taylor) riding one of the horses through the countryside. He is smitten (for Taylor, and maybe the horse, who knows) and turns out the driver of the car is the father of Taylor’s character.

“That sure is a beautiful animal,” says Hudson.

The building in Keswick is no longer a train station, but has been used in the past as a school. It closed as a train station in 1967, according to piedmontsub.com.

The plot of the movie is that Hudson’s character is a rich farmer in Texas who comes to Maryland to buy a prized horse – and he meets the Taylor character on the trip. They marry, move back to a large ranch in Texas, where minority workers are not treated well and all kinds of drama ensues.

The collision set off a chain of derailments and secondary impacts involving three trains, leaving 11 people dead and roughly 180 others injured, one of the region’s most devastating commuter-rail tragedies.

The southbound Metrolink train involved was Ventura County Line train #100, operating in push-pull service with a cab car leading. A Jeep Cherokee had been driven onto the railroad right of way and abandoned on the track a short distance beyond the grade crossing, and the train hit it at around the start of the rush hour. Investigators later treated the vehicle’s placement on the track as a criminal act, and the driver survived.

The impact did not end at the point of collision. Debris from the vehicle and the forces involved contributed to Metrolink #100 derailing, and the derailed consist then struck an unoccupied Union Pacific gravel/work train that had been left standing on a siding nearby. The sequence continued as the Metrolink train jackknifed and collided with passing Metrolink train #901 traveling in the opposite direction, derailing equipment across multiple tracks.

Witness accounts and official summaries described a chaotic scene in darkness and early light, with wrecked cars, twisted metal, and a fire burning near the front of the commuter consist. Passengers were forced to find their way out through damaged cars while emergency calls poured in. Some of the first help came from workers at the nearby Costco, who climbed the perimeter fence, brought fire extinguishers, and assisted victims before the full emergency response was in place.

The response quickly expanded into a major multi-agency operation, with large numbers of fire and medical units converging from surrounding jurisdictions. Helicopters were used as part of the response, and investigators and rescuers worked the site as both an accident scene and a crime scene. The scale of the casualties and the complexity of three derailed trains made the work of searching, triage, and recovery both urgent and prolonged.

In the months and years that followed, the crash became inseparable from the criminal case against Juan Manuel Álvarez, who was accused of leaving the Jeep on the track. In 2008, he was convicted of 11 counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances and one count of arson, and he was sentenced to 11 consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Each January 26, the date endures as a grim marker for commuters and rail workers alike: a reminder of how a single act on the tracks can ripple outward into irreversible loss.","On This Day in 2005, Glendale Train Crash

The circumstances leading up to the collision were not immediately released, and the incident remains under investigation.

The Kern County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as Gerardo Becerra Perez, a resident of Shafter. Law enforcement officials said Perez was hit by a train near the intersection of South Beech Avenue and East Los Angeles Avenue.

SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities.

CRASH INVESTIGATION NEEDED

Each year, hundreds of lives are lost in train-related incidents across the United States, many occurring at crossings with limited warning signs, faulty signals, or inadequate fencing. According to the National Safety Council, railroad fatalities reached 954 in 2024, reflecting a 1% decrease from the revised 2023 total of 967.

Candice Bond, a seasoned train accident attorney, emphasized the importance of conducting an independent investigation promptly following a fatal crash to help preserve critical evidence for a victim’s family.

“An experienced attorney can help shield grieving families from large railroad companies, which often deploy their own investigative teams and have extensive resources to defend against claims,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal.

“Acting quickly is crucial in these cases to ensure that all evidence is properly examined,” Bond added.

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

Pending the outcome of the investigation, surviving family members of Gerardo Becerra Perez may have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim. In such cases, families may seek compensation for loss of companionship, emotional distress, and the pain and suffering caused by the sudden loss of a loved one.

“The emotional toll following the unexpected death of a family member can be devastating,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal.

“A wrongful death attorney can closely monitor the investigation while working to protect the legal rights and interests of the victim’s family,” Formica said.","SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities.

And then, amid the twisted metal of the wreckage, the cries of the injured and the silence of the dead.
Surrounded by bodies after the train accident in southern Spain, one little girl somehow emerged virtually unscathed.
Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.
Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.
“There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,” Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.
Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 42 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.
Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, the town hall said. but The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.
Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.
Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.
“She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,” the mayor said.","

She has been identified as Elinor Peace Steffy, a 22-year-old Sacramento resident who taught at the Hawkins School of the Performing Arts in Folsom and was traveling for work at the time of her death, according to the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office.

Steffy was waiting for a light rail train on Thursday, Jan. 22, when a vehicle veered off the roadway and crashed into the station’s boarding area. Emergency responders confirmed she died at the scene.

At just 22, Steffy had already made a meaningful imprint on the community as an artist, educator and organizer who brought people together through creativity and compassion. Family members and friends described her as deeply giving and endlessly encouraging, often referring to her as “a true mover of love” for the way she unconditionally supported others and inspired those around her.

That sentiment is echoed in a memorial fundraiser launched by her family, which reflects on Steffy’s devotion to service and her ability to uplift everyone she encountered.

“We are raising funds in Elinor’s name to continue her legacy. We will be opening a non-profit organization to pursue these goals,” the family shared, noting that the planned organization will help provide dance education, master classes, workshops, and cultural exchange experiences for Sacramento youth.

On Sunday, the Hawkins School of Performing Arts also spoke about in regards to the tragedy that took the life of their beloved staff member.

“She was deeply loved and will always be cherished by her Hawkins family, and her presence will be profoundly missed by all who knew her,” the school included in its statement.

In addition to her work in dance education, Steffy and her family also helped open and operate the locally owned restaurant Good Eats Sacramento, located near the Curtis Park neighborhood, further extending her presence in the community through small business and service.

The fatal collision occurred shortly before 3 p.m. at the intersection of Folsom Boulevard and Iron Point Road, where multiple 911 calls reported a vehicle leaving Folsom Boulevard, crossing the intersection and entering the light rail station parking area. According to emergency personnel, the vehicle struck a tree before continuing toward the boarding platform, where Steffy, who was reportedly waiting to board the train, was struck and killed.

Responding units from the Folsom Fire Department and Folsom Police Department arrived to find a Tesla precariously lodged onto the light rail platform structure. A second victim, the driver of the vehicle, sustained injuries and was transported to UC Davis Medical Center with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. Authorities confirmed the fatality was a bystander and not an occupant of the vehicle.

Light rail service through the area was shut down for several hours as emergency crews worked the scene and investigators documented the crash. Folsom Police said the incident remains under active investigation and no additional information has been released regarding the cause of the collision. While details are very limited at this time, authorities noted that preliminary findings do not point to alchohol as a factor at this time.

“Before we release a cause or before we release information about the accident. We want to make sure that we have looked at everything. In a fatal collision, that means sometimes weeks and weeks, sometimes even months of work checking every possible angle and gathering all the information that we can get,” said Folsom Police Commander Andrew Bates.

Details regarding memorial services will be shared by family members at a later time. Those wishing to contribute to the memorial fundraising effort in honor of Elinor Peace Steffy can do so online here.

Images courtesy ","The young woman killed in a tragic traffic collision at a Folsom light rail station last week was a beloved local dance instructor whose passion for teaching, creativity and connection touched countless others across the region.

She has been identified as Elinor Peace Steffy, a 22-year-old Sacramento resident who taught at the Hawkins School of the Performing Arts in Folsom and was traveling for work at the time of her death, according to the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office.

Steffy was waiting for a light rail train on Thursday, Jan. 22, when a vehicle veered off the roadway and crashed into the station’s boarding area. Emergency responders confirmed she died at the scene.

At just 22, Steffy had already made a meaningful imprint on the community as an artist, educator and organizer who brought people together through creativity and compassion. Family members and friends described her as deeply giving and endlessly encouraging, often referring to her as “a true mover of love” for the way she unconditionally supported others and inspired those around her.

That sentiment is echoed in a memorial fundraiser launched by her family, which reflects on Steffy’s devotion to service and her ability to uplift everyone she encountered.

“We are raising funds in Elinor’s name to continue her legacy. We will be opening a non-profit organization to pursue these goals,” the family shared, noting that the planned organization will help provide dance education, master classes, workshops, and cultural exchange experiences for Sacramento youth.

On Sunday, the Hawkins School of Performing Arts also spoke about in regards to the tragedy that took the life of their beloved staff member.

“She was deeply loved and will always be cherished by her Hawkins family, and her presence will be profoundly missed by all who knew her,” the school included in its statement.

In addition to her work in dance education, Steffy and her family also helped open and operate the locally owned restaurant Good Eats Sacramento, located near the Curtis Park neighborhood, further extending her presence in the community through small business and service.

The fatal collision occurred shortly before 3 p.m. at the intersection of Folsom Boulevard and Iron Point Road, where multiple 911 calls reported a vehicle leaving Folsom Boulevard, crossing the intersection and entering the light rail station parking area. According to emergency personnel, the vehicle struck a tree before continuing toward the boarding platform, where Steffy, who was reportedly waiting to board the train, was struck and killed.

Responding units from the Folsom Fire Department and Folsom Police Department arrived to find a Tesla precariously lodged onto the light rail platform structure. A second victim, the driver of the vehicle, sustained injuries and was transported to UC Davis Medical Center with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. Authorities confirmed the fatality was a bystander and not an occupant of the vehicle.

Light rail service through the area was shut down for several hours as emergency crews worked the scene and investigators documented the crash.

Deadly Crash Shuts Down Folsom Light Rail

A deadly crash shuts down Folsom light rail near Iron Point Station on Thursday afternoon, January 22, 2026, disrupting Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) service. A vehicle struck the station ramp and overturned onto the tracks, blocking service between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom stations.

Folsom police confirmed that a pedestrian was killed, and another individual was transported to a hospital for treatment. SacRT crews inspected the tracks for damage before resuming normal service around 8 p.m., with a bus bridge in place to maintain transit along the affected route.

Footage from the scene showed the sedan resting at an angle across the tracks, with damage to the station parking lot, indicating a violent collision through the area prior to impacting the tracks.

Deadly Crash Shuts Down Folsom Light Rail
A deadly crash shuts down Folsom light rail near Iron Point Station on Thursday afternoon, January 22, 2026, disrupting Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) service. A vehicle struck the station ramp and overturned onto the tracks, blocking service between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom stations.
Folsom police confirmed that a pedestrian was killed, and another individual was transported to a hospital for treatment. SacRT crews inspected the tracks for damage before resuming normal service around 8 p.m., with a bus bridge in place to maintain transit along the affected route.
Footage from the scene showed the sedan resting at an angle across the tracks, with damage to the station parking lot, indicating a violent collision through the area prior to impacting the tracks.

The disaster on January 18 saw a train derail and collide with another train in Adamuz, a city near Cordoba. It was the deadliest train crash in Spain since 2013, and one of the worst in Europe in recent history.

The families of the deceased will receive €216,000 each within three months, according to Transport Minister Oscar Puente.

The compensation package includes €72,000 in tax-exempt government aid and a €72,000 advance insurance payment, as well as a further €72,000 from passengers' mandatory travel insurance.

For those injured in the crash, payments will range from €2,400 to €84,000 depending on the severity of the injuries, according to Puente.

""We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

""Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain.""

Transport minister under pressure

Puente has come under increasing public scrutiny following the Adamuz crash, compounded by a string of other railway incidents that same week. A train driver died after a crash in Catalonia, while there were two other accidents without fatalities.

The main opposition People’s Party has called for the transport minister's resignation, while Spanish media report that he is under preliminary investigation for a possible criminal offence linked to the accident.

Puente told reporters on Tuesday that he had a ""clear conscience"" and was doing ""my job as best I can"".

""I am acting according to my conscience, my sense of duty, and I will take the decisions I have to take,"" he said, adding that he would demonstrate ""with deeds, not words"" the government's commitment to the crash victims.

Explanations about what caused the Adamuz crash have been scant so far, with an official investigation underway, but some details have started to emerge.

Spain’s rail accident investigating body CIAF said that a fracture in the rail appeared to have been present before the derailment. What caused the apparent fracture isn’t known, investigators said, not ruling out any possibilities.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of national railway company Renfe, has said that ""human error could be ruled out"".

Puente told reporters on Tuesday that he had a ""clear conscience"" and was doing ""my job as best I can"".
""I am acting according to my conscience, my sense of duty, and I will take the decisions I have to take,"" he said, adding that he would demonstrate ""with deeds, not words"" the government's commitment to the crash victims.

Explanations about what caused the Adamuz crash have been scant so far, with an official investigation underway, but some details have started to emerge.
Spain’s rail accident investigating body CIAF said that a fracture in the rail appeared to have been present before the derailment. What caused the apparent fracture isn’t known, investigators said, not ruling out any possibilities.
Álvaro Fernández, the president of national railway company Renfe, has said that ""human error could be ruled out"".
Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for high-speed trains, with more than 3,900km of track, says the International Union of Railways. Crashes causing injury or death are uncommon.

","The Spanish government said on Tuesday it would award €20 million in compensation to the victims of last week’s high-speed train crash in southern Spain, which killed 45 people and injured at least 150.

The disaster on January 18 saw a train derail and collide with another train in Adamuz, a city near Cordoba. It was the deadliest train crash in Spain since 2013, and one of the worst in Europe in recent history.

The families of the deceased will receive €216,000 each within three months, according to Transport Minister Oscar Puente.

The compensation package includes €72,000 in tax-exempt government aid and a €72,000 advance insurance payment, as well as a further €72,000 from passengers' mandatory travel insurance.

For those injured in the crash, payments will range from €2,400 to €84,000 depending on the severity of the injuries, according to Puente.

""We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

""Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain.""

The incident, which also left 152 people injured, occurred near the town of Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, approximately 370 kilometers south of the capital, Madrid.

The tragic event unfolded around 7:45 PM (18:45 GMT) when the rear section of a train carrying approximately 300 passengers from Malaga to Madrid derailed. This section then violently struck an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another city in southern Spain, according to details provided by rail operator Adif.

Transport Minister Oscar Puente confirmed on Monday that the death toll stood at 39, cautioning that this figure was not final. Of the 152 injured passengers, five are reported to be in critical condition, while an additional 24 sustained serious injuries, authorities stated.

Extensive Emergency Response Mobilized

In the immediate aftermath, a comprehensive emergency response was launched. Members of Spain’s Civil Guard and civil defense units worked through the night at the crash site, focusing on rescue and recovery efforts. The local sports center in Adamuz was swiftly converted into a makeshift hospital to manage the influx of casualties.

The Spanish Red Cross established a dedicated help center, offering crucial assistance to emergency services personnel and providing a point of contact for individuals seeking information about the victims. AvandaTimes noted that the coordinated response highlighted the scale of the disaster and the immediate need for extensive support.

Investigation Underway, Cause Undetermined

Minister Puente stated early on Monday that the precise cause of the collision remained unknown. He elaborated on the mechanics of the crash, explaining that the rear section of the first train, after derailing, impacted the front of the second train, which subsequently knocked its initial two carriages off the track and down a 4-meter (13-foot) slope.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez conveyed his deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the devastating accident, underscoring the national grief following the incident.

KELSO, WA, (January 17, 2026) - The Kelso Police Department is investigating a train-pedestrian crash on Jan. 17 that claimed the life of a Hoquiam man.

Joshua Lewis died on Saturday, Jan. 17 after being struck by an Amtrak train under the Cowlitz Way Bridge in Kelso, police say.

Joshua P. Lewis, 38, of Hoquiam died after he was struck by an Amtrak train under the Cowlitz Way Bridge underpass near N. First Avenue and Church Street in Kelso, the Cowlitz County Coroner's Office said. The coroner's office was notified at 5:11 p.m. Saturday.

Lewis was fatally struck by the Amtrak train, the coroner's office said. The cause and manner of death were not released, and the coroner stated no additional information would be provided.

The train was the Coast Starlight, which runs between Los Angeles and Seattle, authorities said. No passengers were injured. The train was delayed 3 hours and 30 minutes.

The Kelso Police Department detective division is investigating the incident.

TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION Based on recent federal data , railroad-related incidents in the United States result in roughly 950 deaths and more than 6,500 injuries each year. These incidents include train–pedestrian strikes, trespassing cases, employee injuries, passenger incidents, and highway-rail grade-crossing crashes. Train and rail-related accidents can occur for many reasons, including human error, track defects, mechanical failures, signal or communication issues, and unauthorized access to rail beds. These possibilities will all be considered by investigators. Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, said in such cases, it's also imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer to protect the rights of a victim. “Train crashes are often complex, and many factors can play a role in these types of accidents,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “A skilled attorney can protect the family of a victim from train companies, which often send their own investigators to crash sites and possess a variety of resources they can utilize in an attempt to defend their negligence. Your lawyer will advocate for you by hiring expert witnesses, locating witnesses to the crash, and reviewing applicable insurance coverage, while carefully guiding you through the legal process and vigorously protecting your best interests.”

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM Pending results of the investigation, the family of Joshua Lewis may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of love and companionship, pain, suffering and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident. “The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand just what families are forced to go through, and having their rights protected is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that their legal rights and best interests are protected.”

Probe finds work carried out during live rail operations with no warning to railway authorities or the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). Contract termination goes to the board on January 29.

The Minister of Transport, under Deputy Prime Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, is moving to terminate construction contracts with the Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd consortium after an initial probe found a contract breach. The investigation found work was carried out while passenger trains were operating, despite clear prohibitions. Investigators also found no communication between the contractor and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) on the day of the disaster. Thirty people were killed and 66 injured when part of an overhead crane collapsed onto passenger carriages of an express train. The proposal to terminate the contract will go before the SRT board this Thursday.

The Ministry of Transport has released the results of its fact-finding investigation into the crane collapse that struck a train in Sikhiu district, Nakhon Ratchasima. As a result, the ministry is preparing to submit a proposal to terminate the contract with Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited to the State Railway of Thailand board.

The contract is the first phase of the Thailand–China high-speed rail route, which was undertaken by the leading Thai firms in partnership with the China Railway Group (CREC).

The findings were announced on January 23, 2026, following a seven-day deadline ordered by the Prime Minister. Accordingly, the investigation was completed within the mandated timeframe and presented without delay. The announcement was made at a press conference chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn.

Senior Transport officials brief the media as committee reviews two crane incidents under Ministry

Senior officials from multiple agencies attended the briefing. These included Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Chayatham Phromsorn, senior ministry executives, and representatives from the State Railway of Thailand and the Department of Highways.

In addition, the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport attended in his capacity as chairman of the fact-finding committee.

The committee investigated two separate crane incidents under the Ministry of Transport’s oversight. The first involved a crane collapse onto a train at a construction site in Sikhiu district. This site forms part of the Thai–Chinese high-speed rail project under contracts 3–4. The second incident involved a crane falling onto a vehicle on Rama 2 Road during construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway.

Mr Phipat said the Prime Minister instructed that the Sikhiu incident be treated as urgent. Therefore, a fact-finding investigation was ordered immediately. The directive required completion within seven days. January 23 marked the final day of that deadline.

Investigation finds crane support base fell during active rail operations beneath construction site

According to the investigation, the object that struck the train was part of the crane’s front support base. Specifically, the component became unbalanced while being moved. As a result, it fell from the structure. At the same time, a train was passing beneath the construction area.

Crucially, investigators found that construction was underway while train services were operating. However, the contract clearly prohibits work above the railway during active train operations. Instead, work is permitted only when train movement is suspended.

Moreover, the contract requires advance notification to railway stations. This notification must be made via radio communication. The purpose is to allow stations to suspend or delay trains until the work area is cleared.

The investigation found no evidence of such communication. In particular, no radio records showed any notification from the construction site on the day of the incident. Consequently, the train entered the construction zone as scheduled.

Failure to notify railway station cited as a critical breach leading to contract termination process

As a result, the crane component fell onto the train, causing a serious accident. Mr Phipat said this failure to notify the station constituted a critical breach of contract conditions. Therefore, evidence was found to incriminate Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

Mr Phipat said the failure was a central issue in determining contract termination. Accordingly, the Ministry of Transport is preparing to submit the matter to the State Railway of Thailand board. He emphasised that the authority to terminate contracts rests with the board, as SRT is a state enterprise.

The proposal will be submitted to the SRT board on January 29. Before that, the matter will be reviewed by the SRT legal subcommittee. Following this process, the board will make a formal decision.

“We know where the error occurred,” Mr Phipat said. He stated that the contract clearly required advance notification. However, the construction site failed to comply.

Anan Pothinimdaeng, Deputy Governor and Acting Governor of the State Railway of Thailand, provided further details. He said the January 14 incident revealed clear deficiencies in safety measures stipulated in the contract.

State Railway confirms lack of radio notice allowed train to enter the construction zone unprotected

Mr Anan explained that contractors must notify stations by radio at least one day in advance. In some cases, notification can be given up to seven days prior. This procedure allows trains to wait until construction areas are cleared.

However, a review of communication logs found no such notification. Consequently, the train moved into the construction area without warning. This directly led to the accident, he said.

Mr Anan confirmed that SRT is preparing to submit the case to its legal subcommittee. Subsequently, the issue will be placed on the agenda of the January 29 board meeting.

Meanwhile, the damaged railway section in Sikhiu district has been repaired. Following inspections, train services have resumed along the affected stretch.

Regarding casualties, officials confirmed that initial compensation has been paid. Specifically, 66 injured individuals received assistance. In addition, families of 30 people killed in the incident have received initial compensation.

Rama 2 Road crane collapse investigation continues as authorities await final conclusions

In contrast, the investigation into the Rama 2 Road incident remains ongoing. Mr Phipat said no final conclusion has yet been reached. Preliminary findings suggest the crane fell after working hours.

The Rama 2 incident occurred during the construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway. A crane collapsed onto a vehicle travelling on the roadway below, causing structural damage to the bridge.

Mr Piyapong Chiwatnakulpaishal, Director-General of the Department of Highways, addressed the situation. He said the Department of Highways, the Ministry of Transport, and the Engineering Institute of Thailand jointly assessed the site.

Following discussions, the agencies agreed to fully close the main road at the construction area. As a result, the affected section of Rama 2 Road will be closed to traffic for 60 days.

Damaged bridge sections will be demolished. In addition, remaining hazardous structures will be cleared. These include sections affected by the collapse of a low-profile girder.

Meanwhile, parallel lanes will be opened for public use. These lanes will accommodate traffic while demolition and clearing operations proceed.

High-risk construction zones faced accelerated deadlines after stability analysis flags collapse

Mr Piyapong said construction is also being accelerated at high-risk points along the bridge crossing the Tha Chin River. These areas involve extensive scaffolding and structural supports.

The Engineering Institute of Thailand conducted an initial stability analysis. The analysis found that prolonged instability posed a collapse risk. Therefore, urgent completion of work was recommended.

As a result, construction in these areas must be completed within 60 days. Delays would increase safety risks, according to the institute.

Mr Piyapong said the suspension of work also serves as a punitive measure. Specifically, it reduces the contractor’s remaining construction time. Moreover, the contractor cannot request additional compensation.

Originally, the project was scheduled to open in April. However, delays caused by the incident will push the opening back. If work is not completed by May 2026, penalties will apply.

Daily fines and possible termination considered as the Highways Department moves to enforcement

The penalty rate is set at 0.25 per cent of the contract value per day. The contract is valued at 1.8 billion baht. Therefore, the daily fine amounts to approximately 4.7 million baht.

Meanwhile, the Department of Highways is preparing for possible contract termination. To that end, a three-party committee has been established.

The committee includes the Department of Highways, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Department of the Comptroller General. It will examine legal conditions and termination rights.

However, if the contractor resumes work, strict conditions will apply. First, the construction site must be fully safe. Second, all machinery must be inspected and fitted with additional alarm sensors.

Third, a new and reliable team of engineers and workers must be appointed. Fourth, the Engineering Institute of Thailand must oversee work continuously. Finally, progress must be reported publicly.

Permanent Secretary Chayatham Phromsorn addressed broader enforcement measures. He said contractor grading, point deductions, demotion, and blacklisting fall under the Ministry of Finance.

Transport ministry pushes contractor penalties despite limits on downgrade authority

These mechanisms are administered by the Comptroller General’s Department. Although relevant regulations already exist, procedural details remain pending.

Nevertheless, Mr Chayatham said the Ministry of Transport has pursued construction safety measures for over three years. Systems, documentation and oversight guidelines were already developed.

However, authority to downgrade contractors remains limited. Such actions must comply with central criteria.

Despite this, the ministry will not wait for full central approval. Accordingly, a separate committee has been established to expedite implementation.

Meanwhile, new penalties have been added to construction contracts under transport agencies. These focus on projects involving serious accidents resulting in death.

Italian-Thai Development accepts responsibility. Firm outlines compensation and safety checks

Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited responded to the findings through Senior Executive Vice President Sumet Surabotsopon. He said the company accepts responsibility for the investigation results.

Mr Sumet said ITD is ready for scrutiny at every stage. He confirmed that initial assistance was paid immediately to injured parties and families of the deceased.

He said compensation exceeding one million baht per person has been prepared. This is in addition to insurance payments and compensation from the State Railway of Thailand.

Mr Sumet said all equipment and machinery met engineering standards. Load-bearing capacity was regularly checked. Rented cranes were inspected by consultants and site supervisors.

Company denies legal action plans as internal penalties reviewed and investigations continue

He said the incidents may have resulted from deficiencies in operational procedures. Nevertheless, the company is ready to accept responsibility. He said the incidents do not reflect all Italian-Thai projects. Instead, they relate to specific operational circumstances.

Mr Sumet denied reports that the company plans to sue the government. He said such claims were untrue. He also confirmed the company’s liquidity remains normal. Accordingly, financial issues have not affected safety standards or material quality. He said a central safety committee oversees all project sites.

He added that a special task force is reviewing internal penalties for negligence. He requested an opportunity to improve operations. The Ministry of Transport said investigations into both incidents remain ongoing. Further legal and administrative action will depend on final determinations.

Probe finds work carried out during live rail operations with no warning to railway authorities or the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). Contract termination goes to the board on January 29.
The Minister of Transport, under Deputy Prime Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, is moving to terminate construction contracts with the Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd consortium after an initial probe found a contract breach. The investigation found work was carried out while passenger trains were operating, despite clear prohibitions. Investigators also found no communication between the contractor and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) on the day of the disaster. Thirty people were killed and 66 injured when part of an overhead crane collapsed onto passenger carriages of an express train. The proposal to terminate the contract will go before the SRT board this Thursday.
The Ministry of Transport has released the results of its fact-finding investigation into the crane collapse that struck a train in Sikhiu district, Nakhon Ratchasima. As a result, the ministry is preparing to submit a proposal to terminate the contract with Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited to the State Railway of Thailand board.
The contract is the first phase of the Thailand–China high-speed rail route, which was undertaken by the leading Thai firms in partnership with the China Railway Group (CREC).
The findings were announced on January 23, 2026, following a seven-day deadline ordered by the Prime Minister. Accordingly, the investigation was completed within the mandated timeframe and presented without delay. The announcement was made at a press conference chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn.
Senior Transport officials brief the media as committee reviews two crane incidents under Ministry
Senior officials from multiple agencies attended the briefing. These included Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Chayatham Phromsorn, senior ministry executives, and representatives from the State Railway of Thailand and the Department of Highways.
In addition, the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport attended in his capacity as chairman of the fact-finding committee.
The committee investigated two separate crane incidents under the Ministry of Transport’s oversight. The first involved a crane collapse onto a train at a construction site in Sikhiu district. This site forms part of the Thai–Chinese high-speed rail project under contracts 3–4. The second incident involved a crane falling onto a vehicle on Rama 2 Road during construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway.
Mr Phipat said the Prime Minister instructed that the Sikhiu incident be treated as urgent. Therefore, a fact-finding investigation was ordered immediately. The directive required completion within seven days. January 23 marked the final day of that deadline.
Investigation finds crane support base fell during active rail operations beneath construction site
According to the investigation, the object that struck the train was part of the crane’s front support base. Specifically, the component became unbalanced while being moved. As a result, it fell from the structure. At the same time, a train was passing beneath the construction area.
Crucially, investigators found that construction was underway while train services were operating. However, the contract clearly prohibits work above the railway during active train operations. Instead, work is permitted only when train movement is suspended.
Moreover, the contract requires advance notification to railway stations. This notification must be made via radio communication. The purpose is to allow stations to suspend or delay trains until the work area is cleared.
The investigation found no evidence of such communication. In particular, no radio records showed any notification from the construction site on the day of the incident. Consequently, the train entered the construction zone as scheduled.
Failure to notify railway station cited as a critical breach leading to contract termination process
As a result, the crane component fell onto the train, causing a serious accident. Mr Phipat said this failure to notify the station constituted a critical breach of contract conditions. Therefore, evidence was found to incriminate Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.
Mr Phipat said the failure was a central issue in determining contract termination. Accordingly, the Ministry of Transport is preparing to submit the matter to the State Railway of Thailand board. He emphasised that the authority to terminate contracts rests with the board, as SRT is a state enterprise.
The proposal will be submitted to the SRT board on January 29. Before that, the matter will be reviewed by the SRT legal subcommittee. Following this process, the board will make a formal decision.
“We know where the error occurred,” Mr Phipat said. He stated that the contract clearly required advance notification. However, the construction site failed to comply.
Anan Pothinimdaeng, Deputy Governor and Acting Governor of the State Railway of Thailand, provided further details. He said the January 14 incident revealed clear deficiencies in safety measures stipulated in the contract.
State Railway confirms lack of radio notice allowed train to enter the construction zone unprotected
Mr Anan explained that contractors must notify stations by radio at least one day in advance. In some cases, notification can be given up to seven days prior. This procedure allows trains to wait until construction areas are cleared.
However, a review of communication logs found no such notification. Consequently, the train moved into the construction area without warning. This directly led to the accident, he said.
Mr Anan confirmed that SRT is preparing to submit the case to its legal subcommittee. Subsequently, the issue will be placed on the agenda of the January 29 board meeting.
Meanwhile, the damaged railway section in Sikhiu district has been repaired. Following inspections, train services have resumed along the affected stretch.
Regarding casualties, officials confirmed that initial compensation has been paid. Specifically, 66 injured individuals received assistance. In addition, families of 30 people killed in the incident have received initial compensation.
Rama 2 Road crane collapse investigation continues as authorities await final conclusions
In contrast, the investigation into the Rama 2 Road incident remains ongoing. Mr Phipat said no final conclusion has yet been reached. Preliminary findings suggest the crane fell after working hours.
The Rama 2 incident occurred during the construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway. A crane collapsed onto a vehicle travelling on the roadway below, causing structural damage to the bridge.
Mr Piyapong Chiwatnakulpaishal, Director-General of the Department of Highways, addressed the situation. He said the Department of Highways, the Ministry of Transport, and the Engineering Institute of Thailand jointly assessed the site.
Following discussions, the agencies agreed to fully close the main road at the construction area. As a result, the affected section of Rama 2 Road will be closed to traffic for 60 days.
Damaged bridge sections will be demolished. In addition, remaining hazardous structures will be cleared. These include sections affected by the collapse of a low-profile girder.
Meanwhile, parallel lanes will be opened for public use. These lanes will accommodate traffic while demolition and clearing operations proceed.
High-risk construction zones faced accelerated deadlines after stability analysis flags collapse
Mr Piyapong said construction is also being accelerated at high-risk points along the bridge crossing the Tha Chin River. These areas involve extensive scaffolding and structural supports.
The Engineering Institute of Thailand conducted an initial stability analysis. The analysis found that prolonged instability posed a collapse risk. Therefore, urgent completion of work was recommended.
As a result, construction in these areas must be completed within 60 days. Delays would increase safety risks, according to the institute.
Mr Piyapong said the suspension of work also serves as a punitive measure. Specifically, it reduces the contractor’s remaining construction time. Moreover, the contractor cannot request additional compensation.
Originally, the project was scheduled to open in April. However, delays caused by the incident will push the opening back. If work is not completed by May 2026, penalties will apply.
Daily fines and possible termination considered as the Highways Department moves to enforcement
The penalty rate is set at 0.25 per cent of the contract value per day. The contract is valued at 1.8 billion baht. Therefore, the daily fine amounts to approximately 4.7 million baht.
Meanwhile, the Department of Highways is preparing for possible contract termination. To that end, a three-party committee has been established.
The committee includes the Department of Highways, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Department of the Comptroller General. It will examine legal conditions and termination rights.
However, if the contractor resumes work, strict conditions will apply. First, the construction site must be fully safe. Second, all machinery must be inspected and fitted with additional alarm sensors.
Third, a new and reliable team of engineers and workers must be appointed. Fourth, the Engineering Institute of Thailand must oversee work continuously. Finally, progress must be reported publicly.
Permanent Secretary Chayatham Phromsorn addressed broader enforcement measures. He said contractor grading, point deductions, demotion, and blacklisting fall under the Ministry of Finance.
Transport ministry pushes contractor penalties despite limits on downgrade authority
These mechanisms are administered by the Comptroller General’s Department. Although relevant regulations already exist, procedural details remain pending.
Nevertheless, Mr Chayatham said the Ministry of Transport has pursued construction safety measures for over three years. Systems, documentation and oversight guidelines were already developed.
However, authority to downgrade contractors remains limited. Such actions must comply with central criteria.
Despite this, the ministry will not wait for full central approval. Accordingly, a separate committee has been established to expedite implementation.
Meanwhile, new penalties have been added to construction contracts under transport agencies. These focus on projects involving serious accidents resulting in death.
Italian-Thai Development accepts responsibility. Firm outlines compensation and safety checks
Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited responded to the findings through Senior Executive Vice President Sumet Surabotsopon. He said the company accepts responsibility for the investigation results.
Mr Sumet said ITD is ready for scrutiny at every stage. He confirmed that initial assistance was paid immediately to injured parties and families of the deceased.
He said compensation exceeding one million baht per person has been prepared. This is in addition to insurance payments and compensation from the State Railway of Thailand.
Mr Sumet said all equipment and machinery met engineering standards. Load-bearing capacity was regularly checked. Rented cranes were inspected by consultants and site supervisors.

The Minister of Transport, under Deputy Prime Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, is moving to terminate construction contracts with the Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd consortium after an initial probe found a contract breach. The investigation found work was carried out while passenger trains were operating, despite clear prohibitions. Investigators also found no communication between the contractor and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) on the day of the disaster. Thirty people were killed and 66 injured when part of an overhead crane collapsed onto passenger carriages of an express train. The proposal to terminate the contract will go before the SRT board this Thursday.

The Ministry of Transport has released the results of its fact-finding investigation into the crane collapse that struck a train in Sikhiu district, Nakhon Ratchasima. As a result, the ministry is preparing to submit a proposal to terminate the contract with Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited to the State Railway of Thailand board.

The contract is the first phase of the Thailand–China high-speed rail route, which was undertaken by the leading Thai firms in partnership with the China Railway Group (CREC).

The findings were announced on January 23, 2026, following a seven-day deadline ordered by the Prime Minister. Accordingly, the investigation was completed within the mandated timeframe and presented without delay. The announcement was made at a press conference chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn.

Senior Transport officials brief the media as committee reviews two crane incidents under Ministry

Senior officials from multiple agencies attended the briefing. These included Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Chayatham Phromsorn, senior ministry executives, and representatives from the State Railway of Thailand and the Department of Highways.

In addition, the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport attended in his capacity as chairman of the fact-finding committee.

The committee investigated two separate crane incidents under the Ministry of Transport’s oversight. The first involved a crane collapse onto a train at a construction site in Sikhiu district. This site forms part of the Thai–Chinese high-speed rail project under contracts 3–4. The second incident involved a crane falling onto a vehicle on Rama 2 Road during construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway.

Mr Phipat said the Prime Minister instructed that the Sikhiu incident be treated as urgent. Therefore, a fact-finding investigation was ordered immediately. The directive required completion within seven days. January 23 marked the final day of that deadline.

Investigation finds crane support base fell during active rail operations beneath construction site

According to the investigation, the object that struck the train was part of the crane’s front support base. Specifically, the component became unbalanced while being moved. As a result, it fell from the structure. At the same time, a train was passing beneath the construction area.

Crucially, investigators found that construction was underway while train services were operating. However, the contract clearly prohibits work above the railway during active train operations. Instead, work is permitted only when train movement is suspended.

Moreover, the contract requires advance notification to railway stations. This notification must be made via radio communication. The purpose is to allow stations to suspend or delay trains until the work area is cleared.

The investigation found no evidence of such communication. In particular, no radio records showed any notification from the construction site on the day of the incident. Consequently, the train entered the construction zone as scheduled.

Failure to notify railway station cited as a critical breach leading to contract termination process

As a result, the crane component fell onto the train, causing a serious accident. Mr Phipat said this failure to notify the station constituted a critical breach of contract conditions. Therefore, evidence was found to incriminate Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

Mr Phipat said the failure was a central issue in determining contract termination. Accordingly, the Ministry of Transport is preparing to submit the matter to the State Railway of Thailand board. He emphasised that the authority to terminate contracts rests with the board, as SRT is a state enterprise.

The proposal will be submitted to the SRT board on January 29. Before that, the matter will be reviewed by the SRT legal subcommittee. Following this process, the board will make a formal decision.

“We know where the error occurred,” Mr Phipat said. He stated that the contract clearly required advance notification. However, the construction site failed to comply.

Anan Pothinimdaeng, Deputy Governor and Acting Governor of the State Railway of Thailand, provided further details. He said the January 14 incident revealed clear deficiencies in safety measures stipulated in the contract.

State Railway confirms lack of radio notice allowed train to enter the construction zone unprotected

Mr Anan explained that contractors must notify stations by radio at least one day in advance. In some cases, notification can be given up to seven days prior. This procedure allows trains to wait until construction areas are cleared.

However, a review of communication logs found no such notification. Consequently, the train moved into the construction area without warning. This directly led to the accident, he said.

Mr Anan confirmed that SRT is preparing to submit the case to its legal subcommittee. Subsequently, the issue will be placed on the agenda of the January 29 board meeting.

Meanwhile, the damaged railway section in Sikhiu district has been repaired. Following inspections, train services have resumed along the affected stretch.

Regarding casualties, officials confirmed that initial compensation has been paid. Specifically, 66 injured individuals received assistance. In addition, families of 30 people killed in the incident have received initial compensation.

Rama 2 Road crane collapse investigation continues as authorities await final conclusions

In contrast, the investigation into the Rama 2 Road incident remains ongoing. Mr Phipat said no final conclusion has yet been reached. Preliminary findings suggest the crane fell after working hours.

The Rama 2 incident occurred during the construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway. A crane collapsed onto a vehicle travelling on the roadway below, causing structural damage to the bridge.

Mr Piyapong Chiwatnakulpaishal, Director-General of the Department of Highways, addressed the situation. He said the Department of Highways, the Ministry of Transport, and the Engineering Institute of Thailand jointly assessed the site.

Following discussions, the agencies agreed to fully close the main road at the construction area. As a result, the affected section of Rama 2 Road will be closed to traffic for 60 days.

Damaged bridge sections will be demolished. In addition, remaining hazardous structures will be cleared. These include sections affected by the collapse of a low-profile girder.

Meanwhile, parallel lanes will be opened for public use. These lanes will accommodate traffic while demolition and clearing operations proceed.

High-risk construction zones faced accelerated deadlines after stability analysis flags collapse

Mr Piyapong said construction is also being accelerated at high-risk points along the bridge crossing the Tha Chin River. These areas involve extensive scaffolding and structural supports.

The Engineering Institute of Thailand conducted an initial stability analysis. The analysis found that prolonged instability posed a collapse risk. Therefore, urgent completion of work was recommended.

As a result, construction in these areas must be completed within 60 days. Delays would increase safety risks, according to the institute.

Mr Piyapong said the suspension of work also serves as a punitive measure. Specifically, it reduces the contractor’s remaining construction time. Moreover, the contractor cannot request additional compensation.

Originally, the project was scheduled to open in April. However, delays caused by the incident will push the opening back. If work is not completed by May 2026, penalties will apply.

Daily fines and possible termination considered as the Highways Department moves to enforcement

The penalty rate is set at 0.25 per cent of the contract value per day. The contract is valued at 1.8 billion baht. Therefore, the daily fine amounts to approximately 4.7 million baht.

Meanwhile, the Department of Highways is preparing for possible contract termination. To that end, a three-party committee has been established.

The committee includes the Department of Highways, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Department of the Comptroller General. It will examine legal conditions and termination rights.

However, if the contractor resumes work, strict conditions will apply. First, the construction site must be fully safe. Second, all machinery must be inspected and fitted with additional alarm sensors.

Third, a new and reliable team of engineers and workers must be appointed. Fourth, the Engineering Institute of Thailand must oversee work continuously. Finally, progress must be reported publicly.

Permanent Secretary Chayatham Phromsorn addressed broader enforcement measures. He said contractor grading, point deductions, demotion, and blacklisting fall under the Ministry of Finance.

Transport ministry pushes contractor penalties despite limits on downgrade authority

These mechanisms are administered by the Comptroller General’s Department. Although relevant regulations already exist, procedural details remain pending.

Nevertheless, Mr Chayatham said the Ministry of Transport has pursued construction safety measures for over three years. Systems, documentation and oversight guidelines were already developed.

However, authority to downgrade contractors remains limited. Such actions must comply with central criteria.

Despite this, the ministry will not wait for full central approval. Accordingly, a separate committee has been established to expedite implementation.

Meanwhile, new penalties have been added to construction contracts under transport agencies. These focus on projects involving serious accidents resulting in death.

Italian-Thai Development accepts responsibility. Firm outlines compensation and safety checks

Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited responded to the findings through Senior Executive Vice President Sumet Surabotsopon. He said the company accepts responsibility for the investigation results.

Mr Sumet said ITD is ready for scrutiny at every stage. He confirmed that initial assistance was paid immediately to injured parties and families of the deceased.

He said compensation exceeding one million baht per person has been prepared. This is in addition to insurance payments and compensation from the State Railway of Thailand.

Mr Sumet said all equipment and machinery met engineering standards. Load-bearing capacity was regularly checked. Rented cranes were inspected by consultants and site supervisors.

Company denies legal action plans as internal penalties reviewed and investigations continue

He said the incidents may have resulted from deficiencies in operational procedures. Nevertheless, the company is ready to accept responsibility. He said the incidents do not reflect all Italian-Thai projects. Instead, they relate to specific operational circumstances.

Mr Sumet denied reports that the company plans to sue the government. He said such claims were untrue. He also confirmed the company’s liquidity remains normal. Accordingly, financial issues have not affected safety standards or material quality. He said a central safety committee oversees all project sites.

He added that a special task force is reviewing internal penalties for negligence. He requested an opportunity to improve operations. The Ministry of Transport said investigations into both incidents remain ongoing. Further legal and administrative action will depend on final determinations.

","Transport Ministry moves to terminate Italian-Thai contract after crane collapsed onto express train, killing 30 and injuring 66. Probe finds work carried out during live rail operations with no warning to railway authorities or the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). Contract termination goes to the board on January 29.

The Minister of Transport, under Deputy Prime Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, is moving to terminate construction contracts with the Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd consortium after an initial probe found a contract breach. The investigation found work was carried out while passenger trains were operating, despite clear prohibitions. Investigators also found no communication between the contractor and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) on the day of the disaster. Thirty people were killed and 66 injured when part of an overhead crane collapsed onto passenger carriages of an express train. The proposal to terminate the contract will go before the SRT board this Thursday.

The Ministry of Transport has released the results of its fact-finding investigation into the crane collapse that struck a train in Sikhiu district, Nakhon Ratchasima. As a result, the ministry is preparing to submit a proposal to terminate the contract with Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited to the State Railway of Thailand board.

The contract is the first phase of the Thailand–China high-speed rail route, which was undertaken by the leading Thai firms in partnership with the China Railway Group (CREC).

The findings were announced on January 23, 2026, following a seven-day deadline ordered by the Prime Minister. Accordingly, the investigation was completed within the mandated timeframe and presented without delay. The announcement was made at a press conference chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn.

Senior Transport officials brief the media as committee reviews two crane incidents under Ministry

Senior officials from multiple agencies attended the briefing. These included Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Chayatham Phromsorn, senior ministry executives, and representatives from the State Railway of Thailand and the Department of Highways.

In addition, the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport attended in his capacity as chairman of the fact-finding committee.

The committee investigated two separate crane incidents under the Ministry of Transport’s oversight. The first involved a crane collapse onto a train at a construction site in Sikhiu district. This site forms part of the Thai–Chinese high-speed rail project under contracts 3–4. The second incident involved a crane falling onto a vehicle on Rama 2 Road during construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway.

Mr Phipat said the Prime Minister instructed that the Sikhiu incident be treated as urgent. Therefore, a fact-finding investigation was ordered immediately. The directive required completion within seven days. January 23 marked the final day of that deadline.

According to the investigation, the object that struck the train was part of the crane’s front support base. Specifically, the component became unbalanced while being moved. As a result, it fell from the structure. At the same time, a train was passing beneath the construction area.

Crucially, investigators found that construction was underway while train services were operating. However, the contract clearly prohibits work above the railway during active train operations. Instead, work is permitted only when train movement is suspended.

Moreover, the contract requires advance notification to railway stations. This notification must be made via radio communication. The purpose is to allow stations to suspend or delay trains until the work area is cleared.

The investigation found no evidence of such communication. In particular, no radio records showed any notification from the construction site on the day of the incident. Consequently, the train entered the construction zone as scheduled.

Failure to notify railway station cited as a critical breach leading to contract termination process

As a result, the crane component fell onto the train, causing a serious accident. Mr Phipat said this failure to notify the station constituted a critical breach of contract conditions. Therefore, evidence was found to incriminate Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

Mr Phipat said the failure was a central issue in determining contract termination. Accordingly, the Ministry of Transport is preparing to submit the matter to the State Railway of Thailand board. He emphasised that the authority to terminate contracts rests with the board, as SRT is a state enterprise.

The proposal will be submitted to the SRT board on January 29. Before that, the matter will be reviewed by the SRT legal subcommittee. Following this process, the board will make a formal decision.

“We know where the error occurred,” Mr Phipat said. He stated that the contract clearly required advance notification. However, the construction site failed to comply.

Anan Pothinimdaeng, Deputy Governor and Acting Governor of the State Railway of Thailand, provided further details. He said the January 14 incident revealed clear deficiencies in safety measures stipulated in the contract.

State Railway confirms lack of radio notice allowed train to enter the construction zone unprotected

Mr Anan explained that contractors must notify stations by radio at least one day in advance. In some cases, notification can be given up to seven days prior. This procedure allows trains to wait until construction areas are cleared.

However, a review of communication logs found no such notification. Consequently, the train moved into the construction area without warning. This directly led to the accident, he said.

Mr Anan confirmed that SRT is preparing to submit the case to its legal subcommittee. Subsequently, the issue will be placed on the agenda of the January 29 board meeting.

Meanwhile, the damaged railway section in Sikhiu district has been repaired. Following inspections, train services have resumed along the affected stretch.

Regarding casualties, officials confirmed that initial compensation has been paid. Specifically, 66 injured individuals received assistance. In addition, families of 30 people killed in the incident have received initial compensation.

In contrast, the investigation into the Rama 2 Road incident remains ongoing. Mr Phipat said no final conclusion has yet been reached. Preliminary findings suggest the crane fell after working hours.

The Rama 2 incident occurred during the construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway. A crane collapsed onto a vehicle travelling on the roadway below, causing structural damage to the bridge.

Mr Piyapong Chiwatnakulpaishal, Director-General of the Department of Highways, addressed the situation. He said the Department of Highways, the Ministry of Transport, and the Engineering Institute of Thailand jointly assessed the site.

Following discussions, the agencies agreed to fully close the main road at the construction area. As a result, the affected section of Rama 2 Road will be closed to traffic for 60 days.

Damaged bridge sections will be demolished. In addition, remaining hazardous structures will be cleared. These include sections affected by the collapse of a low-profile girder.

Meanwhile, parallel lanes will be opened for public use. These lanes will accommodate traffic while demolition and clearing operations proceed.

Mr Piyapong said construction is also being accelerated at high-risk points along the bridge crossing the Tha Chin River. These areas involve extensive scaffolding and structural supports.

The Engineering Institute of Thailand conducted an initial stability analysis. The analysis found that prolonged instability posed a collapse risk. Therefore, urgent completion of work was recommended.

As a result, construction in these areas must be completed within 60 days. Delays would increase safety risks, according to the institute.

Mr Piyapong said the suspension of work also serves as a punitive measure. Specifically, it reduces the contractor’s remaining construction time. Moreover, the contractor cannot request additional compensation.

Originally, the project was scheduled to open in April. However, delays caused by the incident will push the opening back. If work is not completed by May 2026, penalties will apply.

Daily fines and possible termination considered as the Highways Department moves to enforcement

The penalty rate is set at 0.25 per cent of the contract value per day. The contract is valued at 1.8 billion baht. Therefore, the daily fine amounts to approximately 4.7 million baht.

Meanwhile, the Department of Highways is preparing for possible contract termination. To that end, a three-party committee has been established.

The committee includes the Department of Highways, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Department of the Comptroller General. It will examine legal conditions and termination rights.

However, if the contractor resumes work, strict conditions will apply. First, the construction site must be fully safe. Second, all machinery must be inspected and fitted with additional alarm sensors.

Third, a new and reliable team of engineers and workers must be appointed. Fourth, the Engineering Institute of Thailand must oversee work continuously. Finally, progress must be reported publicly.

Permanent Secretary Chayatham Phromsorn addressed broader enforcement measures. He said contractor grading, point deductions, demotion, and blacklisting fall under the Ministry of Finance.

These mechanisms are administered by the Comptroller General’s Department. Although relevant regulations already exist, procedural details remain pending.

Nevertheless, Mr Chayatham said the Ministry of Transport has pursued construction safety measures for over three years. Systems, documentation and oversight guidelines were already developed.

However, authority to downgrade contractors remains limited. Such actions must comply with central criteria.

Despite this, the ministry will not wait for full central approval. Accordingly, a separate committee has been established to expedite implementation.

Meanwhile, new penalties have been added to construction contracts under transport agencies. These focus on projects involving serious accidents resulting in death.

Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited responded to the findings through Senior Executive Vice President Sumet Surabotsopon. He said the company accepts responsibility for the investigation results.

Mr Sumet said ITD is ready for scrutiny at every stage. He confirmed that initial assistance was paid immediately to injured parties and families of the deceased.

He said compensation exceeding one million baht per person has been prepared. This is in addition to insurance payments and compensation from the State Railway of Thailand.

Mr Sumet said all equipment and machinery met engineering standards. Load-bearing capacity was regularly checked. Rented cranes were inspected by consultants and site supervisors.

He said the incidents may have resulted from deficiencies in operational procedures. Nevertheless, the company is ready to accept responsibility. He said the incidents do not reflect all Italian-Thai projects. Instead, they relate to specific operational circumstances.

Mr Sumet denied reports that the company plans to sue the government. He said such claims were untrue. He also confirmed the company’s liquidity remains normal. Accordingly, financial issues have not affected safety standards or material quality. He said a central safety committee oversees all project sites.

TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Based on recent federal data, railroad-related incidents in the United States result in roughly 950 deaths and more than 6,500 injuries each year. These incidents include train–pedestrian strikes, trespassing cases, employee injuries, passenger incidents, and highway-rail grade-crossing crashes.

Train and rail-related accidents can occur for many reasons, including human error, track defects, mechanical failures, signal or communication issues, and unauthorized access to rail beds.

All of these factors will be carefully reviewed as part of the investigation. Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, noted that in cases like this, it is also critical to have an independent inquiry conducted by a seasoned lawyer to help protect the rights of the victim’s family.

“Train crashes are often complex, and multiple elements can contribute to these incidents,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “A skilled attorney can safeguard a victim’s family from rail companies that deploy their own investigators to accident scenes and possess extensive resources to defend against negligence claims. Legal counsel can advocate by securing expert analysis, identifying witnesses, reviewing insurance coverage, and guiding families through the legal process while vigorously protecting their best interests.”

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

Pending results of the investigation, the family of Joshua Lewis may be entitled to pursue a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of love and companionship, pain, suffering, and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident.

“The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand what families are forced to go through, and having their rights protected is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that their legal rights and best interests are protected.”","KELSO, WA (January 17, 2026) – A Hoquiam man was killed Saturday evening after being struck by an Amtrak train under the Cowlitz Way Bridge in Kelso, authorities said.

A project once pitched as the future of transportation is now facing its biggest setback yet.

Or as Congressman Kevin Kiley calls it, the train to nowhere.

[RELATED] High-speed rail setback hits Central Valley after $4B funding loss

Across the Central Valley, unfinished pillars and concrete foundations sit for miles, a silent reminder of a project years behind schedule and billions of dollars overbudget.

""This is fantastic news for American taxpayers and California taxpayers, as the high-speed rail project is considered the largest public infrastructure failure in United States history,"" said Kiley.

A year ago, Congressman Kiley introduced legislation aimed at slashing federal funding.

And now that legislation has reached its destination.

""In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the House passed this measure as part of an appropriations bill that will soon be signed into law,"" said Kiley.

The project's impact has derailed more than just state and federal budgets.

Along the planned rail corridor, businesses say construction has forced relocations, disrupted daily operations, and created long-term uncertainty, all while progress on the rail line remains stalled.

As the date to the finish line keeps slipping back, the cost keeps rising.

""It was supposed to be done in 2020, and yet now, in 2026, no track has been laid despite spending $18 billion,"" said Kiley.

ESSEX COUNTY, NJ — Federal investigators have released preliminary findings from their investigation into a NJ Transit train derailment that recently took place in North Jersey.

The derailment took place in Montclair on the evening of Dec. 19, temporarily suspending rail service on a stretch of the Montclair-Boonton line. Authorities initially reported that 17 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Six people – each NJ Transit crew members – were hospitalized and later released. All 11 passengers declined medical transport. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released an update about their ongoing investigation into the derailment, which caused about $180,000 in damages.

According to the NTSB, the incident took place at 6:47 p.m. when an eastbound commuter train collided with a stopped commuter train that had 11 passengers on board. The eastbound train had one cab car, four passenger cars and one pushing locomotive. The other train had one cab car, two passenger cars and one pushing locomotive.

Both trains were crewed by one conductor, one engineer and one brakeman. Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were “dark and clear with no precipitation,” the NTSB reported.

Before the accident, both trains were westbound traveling on track 1. However, due to downed trees blocking the track – a result of a storm earlier that evening – NJ Transit rerouted the trains, having them turn back east and operate on track 2.

Here’s what happened next, the NTSB said:
“The struck train was stopped on track 2 waiting for a train ahead to depart Bay Street Station. The collision occurred in a sharp right-hand curve on a downhill grade with about 126 feet of limited sight distance when the standing train could first be seen … At the time of the collision, the striking train was operating on a stop and proceed signal indication that required movement under restricted-speed rules. The striking train collided with the stopped train at 17 mph. Three cars from the striking train derailed and one car from the struck train derailed.”
According to the NTSB, investigators at the scene inspected the track, signals and equipment, performed “sight-distance observations” using exemplar trains, reviewed event recorder data and performed interviews. Federal investigators have requested documents including the NJ Transit dispatcher radio and telephone recordings.
An investigation continues, the agency said last week.
“Future investigative activity will focus on NJ Transit’s internal oversight, operational procedure and Positive Train Control functionality on trains operating at restricted speed,” the NTSB added.

Before the accident, both trains were westbound traveling on track 1. However, due to downed trees blocking the track – a result of a storm earlier that evening – NJ Transit rerouted the trains, having them turn back east and operate on track 2. Here’s what happened next, the NTSB said:

“The struck train was stopped on track 2 waiting for a train ahead to depart Bay Street Station. The collision occurred in a sharp right-hand curve on a downhill grade with about 126 feet of limited sight distance when the standing train could first be seen … At the time of the collision, the striking train was operating on a stop and proceed signal indication that required movement under restricted-speed rules. The striking train collided with the stopped train at 17 mph. Three cars from the striking train derailed and one car from the struck train derailed.” According to the NTSB, investigators at the scene inspected the track, signals and equipment, performed “sight-distance observations” using exemplar trains, reviewed event recorder data and performed interviews. Federal investigators have requested documents including the NJ Transit dispatcher radio and telephone recordings. An investigation continues, the agency said last week. “Future investigative activity will focus on NJ Transit’s internal oversight, operational procedure and Positive Train Control functionality on trains operating at restricted speed,” the NTSB added.

Fruzsina De Cloedt reports.

A Saskatchewan man is calling for changes to a rail crossing in the community of Churchbridge, after losing his wife in a fatal train collision just a month after their wedding.

Alyssa and Matthew Thompson were wed in Mexico in November 2025. It was a joyous occasion, and things were looking up for the young couple. The pair bought a house in the town of Churchbridge, Sask., just down the street from their previous rental, with Matthew calling it fate.

Their new home was filled with life, and they shared it with Alyssa’s eight-year-old son and their many rescue cats.

“[Alyssa] was charismatic, full of life and energy and she was just a beautiful soul inside and out,” Matthew told CTV News.

Whenever time allowed, the family went hiking and they loved travelling together; little trinkets hanging from their living room walls serve as reminders.

The crash

The morning of Dec. 29, 2025, was like any other morning for the Thompson family, as Alyssa was getting ready to go to work.

“She worked at a care home, and she loved all there is to [it]. She really spent her whole life just caring for others more than she cared for herself,” he said.

Alyssa had asked Matthew to brew her coffee, then he kissed her goodbye as she left for work in her red SUV.

It was early in the morning and still dark outside. About 10 minutes later, Matthew received a text from his mother-in-law, who works at the nearby Langenburg Hospital.

“She’d heard that the ambulance got dispatched to a train accident, so I pretty much instantly just threw on my shoes and ran down the street, to the train there,” Matthew recalled.

The railroad crossing is one of two in Churchbridge, located at the end of their street, merely a few minutes from the house. There were already people on the scene of the accident, but the vehicle was out of sight.

“There was a guy standing there and I asked what kind of vehicle it was. He said it was a red SUV. And I said, ‘I think that’s my wife,’” Matthew said.

Matthew then climbed across the train to get to the other side of the tracks, but one of his acquaintances from the fire department told him not to go to the scene, confirming his fears.

“Nobody could really say anything at the time. I was asking, you know, ‘Is she responsive? Is she breathing and talking?’ type of things, but I don’t think anybody was really allowed to say [anything] until the police got there,” he said.

Matthew lost his wife that morning. Alyssa was 29 years old.

“It’s been three weeks, almost a month [since losing her]. And I still feel the same, you know ... empty,” he said.

Matthew was devastated and said he needed a few weeks to become “half normal.” He didn’t know much about the circumstances of the accident, so he reached out to the Canada Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) railway for details of the collision, wanting to know if any of the parties were at fault.

He says neither CPKC nor the RCMP Esterhazy detachment had any additional information for him, and he was not provided with the incident report either.

“They responded that they wouldn’t be releasing that information to me. I would just like some answers as towards what might have happened,” Matthew explained.

In particular, he wanted to know whether the train driver reduced speed and/or used its warning lights and sounds that morning.

A dangerous crossing

Matthew and Alyssa were aware that the crossing wasn’t equipped with lights, having lived in Churchbridge for the past four years. He told CTV News that they regularly reminded each other to be careful when passing through the intersection.

“If you stop behind the stop line, you see the house, you see the tree line, and you just see black,” he described the location. “It’s uphill, it’s slippery, it’s covered with ice most of the time.”

Matthew has been driving through it constantly when it’s dark outside, “to see what it is that she might have seen that morning.”

In his experience, drivers must get close to the tracks to see if there is a train approaching due to the obstructions, which is unsafe due to the icy surface.

“If there was a set of lights there, at least you’d know to not even pull out to look,” he added.

Calls for action

Following his wife’s death, Matthew asked the railway company to install lights at the crossing in an effort to prevent further tragedies. But he says he was told no.

“What amount of money is worth all the lives that it’s costed there?” he asked. “To me, there’s no price you could put on my wife’s life.”

According to Statistics Canada, the population of Churchbridge was just shy of 900 in 2021. Many of its residents work in the nearby towns, such as Yorkton and Esterhazy, generating a constant flow of traffic through its two railroad crossings.

CTV News reached out to both CPKC and the RCMP. While the RCMP confirmed the accident, they didn’t provide additional information.

In their response to CTV News, CPKC expressed its deepest sympathies to the family.

The railway company said the grade crossing regulations and standards are established by Transport Canada.

“The sight lines at the Lovel Street crossing are compliant with those regulations,” the statement read.

According to Transport Canada’s database, there had already been two accidents in the crossing where Alyssa lost her life. Almost exactly three years ago, a 41-year-old father was killed in a crash at the intersection. His two children were also injured.

“I’d like to hope that in the future something gets done about it, even a set of lights put in there so that we could prevent [fatal accidents] from happening to any other families in the future,” Matthew said.

The newlyweds had already booked their honeymoon for March, a trip Matthew and his stepson will go on together, bringing Alyssa’s ashes along to scatter at a place she would have loved very much.

“I think about the future, and it’s hard to imagine getting any sort of joy out of these goals we’ve made together,” he said. “When the person that I made the goals with isn’t with me anymore.”","A Saskatchewan man is calling for changes to a rail crossing in the community of Churchbridge, after losing his wife in a fatal train collision just a month after their wedding.

According to Transport Canada’s database, there had already been two accidents in the crossing where Alyssa lost her life. Almost exactly three years ago, a 41-year-old father was killed in a crash at the intersection. His two children were also injured.

“I’d like to hope that in the future something gets done about it, even a set of lights put in there so that we could prevent [fatal accidents] from happening to any other families in the future,” Matthew said.

The newlyweds had already booked their honeymoon for March, a trip Matthew and his stepson will go on together, bringing Alyssa’s ashes along to scatter at a place she would have loved very much.

“I think about the future, and it’s hard to imagine getting any sort of joy out of these goals we’ve made together,” he said. “When the person that I made the goals with isn’t with me anymore.”"

FOLSOM, Calif. — Family and friends are remembering a beloved dance instructor who died Thursday after she was struck by a driver at a Folsom light rail station.

Elinor Peace Steffy, 22, of Sacramento, died from blunt force injuries she suffered in the crash at Iron Point Road and Folsom Boulevard, Sacramento County Coroner's Office records show.

Over the weekend, her father James Weems said he received a call telling him his daughter had been struck by a driver at the Iron Point Light Rail Station. He visited the crash site Sunday night and struggled to understand how the car struck his daughter before ending up on the tracks, he said.

On Monday, he told ABC10 he hopes his daughter did not suffer.

""I hope she didn't see it coming. Because, I try to think about that. That's what I was trying to see last night. But I couldn't see it,"" Weems said.

He said her loss is still difficult to understand.

""I've tried to make some sort of sense of it and all that kind of stuff, but it's kind of hard,"" Weems said through tears.

Steffy was reportedly on her way to work as a dance instructor at the Hawkins School of Performing Arts in Folsom. Dance was part of her life from an early age, her father said.

Who was Elinor Steffy?

Elinor Steffy’s mother, Delcy, said the family is profoundly grieving the loss of their beloved daughter whose light shined brightly and impacted many people.

Steffy was well known in the local dance community, including at The Torch Club, where her friends said she was a regular on Sundays and recognized for her dance moves.

Abigail Gibson, Steffy's friend, said she brought energy wherever she went and was passionate about dance, the people she taught and the community she built.

""She was just the life of the party everywhere she went,"" Gibson said. ""It was kind of impossible to be in a bad mood around her. She was always moving, always singing, always dancing.""

Steffy's family is working to establish a nonprofit in her name to ensure her legacy continues, according to her friends.

The family has set up a GoFundMe to raise money for the nonprofit, which they said will support dance education, master classes, workshops and cultural exchange experiences for Sacramento youth.

Elijah Weber, another friend, said the plans are still taking shape.

""Everything is still all in the works. This is all very sudden, but right now we're trying to contribute all community funds to further her legacy, especially in the arts, specifically with dance and children, kind of furthering the love that she loved to give to everyone,"" Weber said.

Weems said his hope is that his daughter left a lasting impression on the children she taught and that their futures reflect the impact she had on them.

What is known about the crash?

A sedan collided with Steffy around 2:50 p.m. Thursday at the Iron Point Light Rail Station, authorities said.

The car was heading west, downhill and through a parking lot on Iron Point Road when it struck a raised platform and came to a rest at an angle on the light rail tracks, according to Folsom Police Department spokesman Cmdr. Andrew Bates.

Steffy was pronounced dead on scene, per law enforcement. The driver, identified as a woman, was taken to the hospital for injuries she suffered in the crash, Bates said.

Preliminary findings indicate alcohol does not appear to have been a factor in the crash, though the crash's cause remains under investigation, police said.

""Before we release a cause or before we release information about the accident, we want to make sure that we have looked at everything,"" Bates said. ""Unfortunately, in a fatal collision, that means sometimes weeks and weeks, sometimes even months of work checking every possible angle and gathering all the information that we can get.""

A bus bridge had been in place between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom light rail stations after the crash due to the blocked tracks, according to Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT).

“The Union Pacific team delivered our best ever full year across safety, service and operating excellence,” CEO Jim Vena said on the railroad’s earnings call on Tuesday morning. “As we close out the year, it’s clear the team is consistently delivering at the highest levels, and I’m confident that’s what we’ll continue to do.”

For the year, operating income rose 1%, to $9.8 billion, as revenue rose 1%, to $24.5 billion. Overall volume also was up 1%. Earnings per share grew 8%, to $11.09. The railroad’s operating ratio was 59.8%, an improvement of 0.1 points.

“We remain disciplined, setting the best ever full-year record for workforce productivity as we utilized 3% fewer employees to move 1% more volume,” Vena said.

Fourth-quarter volume declined 4% due to a 10% drop in premium traffic, which includes intermodal and automotive business.

Most of the intermodal decline was due to a 30% drop in international volume, which came down from record levels in 2024. Domestic intermodal volume had a record quarter and year, said Kenny Rocker, the railroad’s executive vice president of marketing and sales.

Bulk traffic, which includes coal, was up 3%, while industrial products traffic notched out a 1% quarterly gain.

Fourth-quarter operating income declined 5%, to $2.4 billion, as revenue declined 1%, to $6.08 billion. Earnings per share increased 7%, to $3.11. The railroad’s fourth-quarter operating ratio was 60.5%, a 1.8-point increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, as expenses increased 2%, to $3.68 billion.

Quarterly freight car velocity increased 9% to a record 239 car-miles per day. Average train speed was up 7%, while terminal dwell was down 9% to a record 19.8 hours. Average train length was a record, at 9,729 feet.

Eric Gehringer, executive vice president of operations, noted that the railroad had its lowest ever train accident and employee injury rates in 2025.

Chief Financial Officer Jennier Hamann says UP expects to hit the three-year financial targets outlined at its September 2024 investor day. For this year, UP forecasts earnings per share growth of around 5%, along with operating ratio improvement despite a muted economic outlook.

Rocker says UP has a positive outlook for coal, grain, and chemicals and plastics traffic this year. The railroad’s outlook is negative, however, for forest products, intermodal, and automotive.

UP’s $3.3 billion 2026 capital plan includes $1.9 on track maintenance, $600 million for capacity improvements and siding extensions, $400 million for locomotive modernizations, and $400 million for technology projects.

Zip Code","Spain aims to restart within 10 days full service on a key high-speed railway line where a collision between two trains killed 45 people, the transport minister said on Wednesday.
The January 18 disaster in the southern region of Andalusia -- one of Europe's deadliest such accidents this century -- partially shut the line linking Madrid and the city of Seville as investigators cleared the wreckage and collected evidence.
""Today we have received legal permission to proceed with the replacement of the infrastructure in the section of the accident,"" Transport Minister Oscar Puente wrote on X.
""Our aim is that it is completed in a timeframe of approximately 10 calendar days. After the replacement, the whole of the Madrid-Seville line will resume service,"" he added.
The line was Spain's first high-speed rail connection when it opened in 1992, with the network expanding to become the world's second-largest after China's and a source of national pride.
But the accident has raised doubts about the safety of rail travel in the country.
A preliminary report released last week suggested the track was cracked before a train run by private firm Iryo derailed and smashed into an oncoming service operated by state company Renfe.

The train crashed at Carmont near Stonehaven on August 12 2020 after it hit a pile of gravel washed onto the railway track by heavy rain before striking a bridge parapet.

Of the nine people who were aboard the train, three – train driver Brett McCullough, 45; conductor Donald Dinnie, 58; and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62 – were killed.

The fatal incident inquiry (FAI) at Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard on Wednesday that the train was made up of mark 3 high speed train (HST) coaches, which were built by British Rail in the 1970s.

Dominique Louis, a principal inspector at the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), told the inquiry the 50-year-old coaches lacked a number of safety features that are now standard in modern trains.

He told the inquiry: “The RAIB considers it more likely than not that the outcome would have been better if the train had been compliant with modern crashworthiness standards.”

Mr Louis said the coaches were built before the requirement for “anti-climb devices” – which prevent one coach riding over the top of another in the event of a crash – and “energy-absorbing vehicle ends” such as crumple zones.

Had these been in place, he said, they would have reduced the risk of coach D “overriding” the lead power car, which he said caused a “complete loss of survival space” that resulted in the death of Mr Dinnie.

He also said the “couplers” linking the coaches were together less capable than modern designs of withstanding the forces caused by the collision, which resulted in the train breaking up.

“All the vehicles became uncoupled except at the interface of coach A and the trailing power car,” Mr Louis said.

“That allowed the vehicle to scatter and roll over. That increased the risk of secondary impacts.”

Mr Louis also pointed out the coaches lacked devices to ensure they remained attached to their “bogies”, or wheeled chassis, which he said resulted in the five-tonne bogies being free to “slide and roll around in an uncontrolled manner”.

The inquiry is taking place at Aberdeen Sheriff Court (Andrew Milligan/PA) (Andrew Milligan)

He explained: “Mark three coaches, unlike vehicles designed after 1994, are not fitted with any form of bogie retention in the vertical direction.

“This allowed the vehicle bodies to lift off their bogies during the derailment, and that’s how we ended up with so many bogies scattered around the accident site.”

Taken together, he said, “stronger couplers combined with anti-climbers and energy absorption structures” could have enabled coach D to keep the lead power car on track for long enough to make it over the bridge.

The inquiry also heard that corrosion had been found in a number of areas damaged in the crash, including around the base of pillars in coach D that were sheared off in the collision.

Mr Louis said metallurgical analysis found what should have been 5mm plates of steel had been reduced to 3-3.5mm, despite corrosion repairs having been made to the coach in 2019.

Mr Louis said: “It is undeniable that loss of material due to corrosion of the pillars would have weakened the body-end structure to some extent.”

However he added: “The investigation was not able to determine whether or not the original strength of the pillars would have been sufficient to prevent the loss of survival space that led to the death of the train’s conductor.”

The inquiry also heard evidence about the two fires that broke out following the collision, in the power car and in coach B, with RAIB inspector Mark Hamilton explaining that since nobody was trapped inside the train, they had not posed a risk to human life.

The FAI was previously told the death toll would have “almost certainly” been higher had the train been full on August 12 2020.

The crash took place during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Aberdeen area on lockdown, and there was a drop of around 65% in passenger numbers across the entire network at the time, the inquiry heard.

A criminal prosecution saw Network Rail fined £6.7 million in 2023 after it admitted health and safety failings over the crash.

A Network Rail spokesperson said on Monday the Government-owned company is “committed to supporting the work of the inquiry and continuing to deliver on the recommendations made by RAIB”.

They added: “We’ve made significant changes to how we manage the risk of severe weather since the accident and our work to make our network more resilient will continue.”

He also said the “couplers” linking the coaches were together less capable than modern designs of withstanding the forces caused by the collision, which resulted in the train breaking up.

“All the vehicles became uncoupled except at the interface of coach A and the trailing power car,” Mr Louis said.

“That allowed the vehicle to scatter and roll over. That increased the risk of secondary impacts.”

Mr Louis also pointed out the coaches lacked devices to ensure they remained attached to their “bogies”, or wheeled chassis, which he said resulted in the five-tonne bogies being free to “slide and roll around in an uncontrolled manner”.

He explained: “Mark three coaches, unlike vehicles designed after 1994, are not fitted with any form of bogie retention in the vertical direction.

“This allowed the vehicle bodies to lift off their bogies during the derailment, and that’s how we ended up with so many bogies scattered around the accident site.”

Taken together, he said, “stronger couplers combined with anti-climbers and energy absorption structures” could have enabled coach D to keep the lead power car on track for long enough to make it over the bridge.

The inquiry also heard that corrosion had been found in a number of areas damaged in the crash, including around the base of pillars in coach D that were sheared off in the collision.

Mr Louis said metallurgical analysis found what should have been 5mm plates of steel had been reduced to 3-3.5mm, despite corrosion repairs having been made to the coach in 2019.

Mr Louis said: “It is undeniable that loss of material due to corrosion of the pillars would have weakened the body-end structure to some extent.”

However he added: “The investigation was not able to determine whether or not the original strength of the pillars would have been sufficient to prevent the loss of survival space that led to the death of the train’s conductor.”

The inquiry also heard evidence about the two fires that broke out following the collision, in the power car and in coach B, with RAIB inspector Mark Hamilton explaining that since nobody was trapped inside the train, they had not posed a risk to human life.

The FAI was previously told the death toll would have “almost certainly” been higher had the train been full on August 12 2020.

The crash took place during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Aberdeen area on lockdown, and there was a drop of around 65% in passenger numbers across the entire network at the time, the inquiry heard.

A criminal prosecution saw Network Rail fined £6.7 million in 2023 after it admitted health and safety failings over the crash.

A Network Rail spokesperson said on Monday the Government-owned company is “committed to supporting the work of the inquiry and continuing to deliver on the recommendations made by RAIB”.

They added: “We’ve made significant changes to how we manage the risk of severe weather since the accident and our work to make our network more resilient will continue.”"

The crash, which occurred on January 18, is Spain’s deadliest train accident since 2013 and one of the highest death tolls from a rail disaster in recent European history. Families of those killed will receive 216,000 euros each within three months. The payment is split between 72,000 euros in tax-exempt government aid, 72,000 euros in advance insurance payouts, and 72,000 euros from mandatory travel insurance.
Puente emphasized the urgency of support, stating, “We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this. Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain.”
Payments to injured passengers will range from 2,400 euros to 84,000 euros, depending on the severity of their injuries.
The tragedy has intensified public scrutiny of Transport Minister Puente, with opposition parties, including the People’s Party, calling for his resignation following multiple railway incidents that same week. In Catalonia, a train driver died, and commuter rail services faced widespread disruption as drivers refused to operate over safety concerns, compounded by a software failure that shut down the Rodalies train traffic control center.
Puente defended his record, saying he had acted with a “calm conscience” and worked to keep citizens fully informed during the crisis.","

In a video message, Godoy said that when the train crashed, it was traveling at 65 kilometers per hour (km/h) on a curve where the maximum “authorized speed” is 50 km/h.

She said that the speed the train was traveling when it derailed in the state of Oaxaca on Dec. 28 was determined via information obtained from the black box, which was located in one of the train’s two locomotives.

In addition to the 14 fatalities, almost 100 people were injured in the crash, which occurred near the small Oaxaca town of Nizanda.

The driver of the train was arrested in Palenque, Chiapas, on Monday. He faces charges of culpable homicide and causing injuries due to his allegedly negligent driving.

Godoy said that the train was inspected after the accident and no defects that could have placed its operation at risk were found.

On stretches of railroad that the train passed before the accident occurred, it “reduced its speed, which allowed us to know that the braking system was working properly,” she said.

Godoy also said that no damage was found on the tracks.

She noted that a range of experts across fields, including topography, mechanical and electrical engineering, telecommunications and “industrial safety” contributed to the investigation carried out by the Federal Attorney General’s Office (FGR).

The attorney general said that investigations will continue to determine whether any other factors contributed to the accident, but as things stand, excessive speed has been established as the sole cause.

The train traveled at excessive speed during a period of more than 1 hour before the accident occurred

The Interoceanic Train was traveling across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, when the accident occurred.

Citing information obtained from the black box, Godoy said that the train, prior to the derailment, reached speeds of 111 km/h on straight stretches of railroad, 41 km/h above the “authorized limit.”

She said that the train rounded the six curves before the accident location at a speed of 52 km/h, slightly above the authorized limit.

Godoy stressed that “speeding on a train is much more dangerous than in a conventional vehicle” due to a train’s weight and mass as well as the radius of the curves it passes through. Consequently, she said, the “centrifugal force increases — that is the force that pushes the vehicle away from its center of rotation, which causes it to leave the tracks and overturn.”

The train that crashed on Dec. 28 — made up of two locomotives and four passenger cars — weighed approximately 400 tonnes and was transporting around 250 people.

Citing the investigation carried out by the FGR, the newspaper Reforma reported that the train traveled at excessive speed during a period of over an hour, but the driver wasn’t warned about his speeding or “stopped.”

“… Godoy didn’t say why, on the route [the train] covered before the accident — where there were two stops at stations — no alert or automated system was activated to make [the driver] reduce his speed,” Reforma wrote.

Carlos Barreda, a railroad expert, told Reforma that the trains that run on the interoceanic route have speed alert systems and speed control mechanisms. However, he questioned whether they were working.

The previous federal government modernized the railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as part of an ambitious trade corridor project. Former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador inaugurated the line in late 2023.

“Authorities, kings, politicians and rulers have been dreaming” about connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico for “centuries,” he said at the time.

Cargo unloaded at the ports in Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos can be transported across the isthmus by freight trains before being reloaded onto a ship to complete its journey to its final destination.

“It’s an exceptional project — it provides an alternative to the Panama Canal,” President Claudia Sheinbaum said in March 2025, referring to the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which includes the modernized railroad between Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos.

In a video message, Godoy said that when the train crashed, it was traveling at 65 kilometers per hour (km/h) on a curve where the maximum “authorized speed” is 50 km/h.

She said that the speed the train was traveling when it derailed in the state of Oaxaca on Dec. 28 was determined via information obtained from the black box, which was located in one of the train’s two locomotives.

In addition to the 14 fatalities, almost 100 people were injured in the crash, which occurred near the small Oaxaca town of Nizanda.

The driver of the train was arrested in Palenque, Chiapas, on Monday. He faces charges of culpable homicide and causing injuries due to his allegedly negligent driving.

Godoy said that the train was inspected after the accident and no defects that could have placed its operation at risk were found.

On stretches of railroad that the train passed before the accident occurred, it “reduced its speed, which allowed us to know that the braking system was working properly,” she said.

Godoy also said that no damage was found on the tracks.

She noted that a range of experts across fields, including topography, mechanical and electrical engineering, telecommunications and “industrial safety” contributed to the investigation carried out by the Federal Attorney General’s Office (FGR).

The attorney general said that investigations will continue to determine whether any other factors contributed to the accident, but as things stand, excessive speed has been established as the sole cause.

The train traveled at excessive speed during a period of more than 1 hour before the accident occurred

The Interoceanic Train was traveling across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, when the accident occurred.

Citing information obtained from the black box, Godoy said that the train, prior to the derailment, reached speeds of 111 km/h on straight stretches of railroad, 41 km/h above the “authorized limit.”

She said that the train rounded the six curves before the accident location at a speed of 52 km/h, slightly above the authorized limit.

Godoy stressed that “speeding on a train is much more dangerous than in a conventional vehicle” due to a train’s weight and mass as well as the radius of the curves it passes through. Consequently, she said, the “centrifugal force increases — that is the force that pushes the vehicle away from its center of rotation, which causes it to leave the tracks and overturn.”

The train that crashed on Dec. 28 — made up of two locomotives and four passenger cars — weighed approximately 400 tonnes and was transporting around 250 people.

Citing the investigation carried out by the FGR, the newspaper Reforma reported that the train traveled at excessive speed during a period of over an hour, but the driver wasn’t warned about his speeding or “stopped.”

“… Godoy didn’t say why, on the route [the train] covered before the accident — where there were two stops at stations — no alert or automated system was activated to make [the driver] reduce his speed,” Reforma wrote.

Carlos Barreda, a railroad expert, told Reforma that the trains that run on the interoceanic route have speed alert systems and speed control mechanisms. However, he questioned whether they were working.

The previous federal government modernized the railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as part of an ambitious trade corridor project. Former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador inaugurated the line in late 2023.

“Authorities, kings, politicians and rulers have been dreaming” about connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico for “centuries,” he said at the time.

Cargo unloaded at the ports in Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos can be transported across the isthmus by freight trains before being reloaded onto a ship to complete its journey to its final destination.

“It’s an exceptional project — it provides an alternative to the Panama Canal,” President Claudia Sheinbaum said in March 2025, referring to the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which includes the modernized railroad between Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos.

New faults on AVE and commuter lines add to the growing list of incidents across Spain's rail network

Spain's rail crisis continues as new incidents on commuter, medium-distance and high-speed lines add to ongoing disruption across the network, following the fatal train crash in Adamuz (Córdoba).

Since this tragic incident, where 45 people lost their lives and 152 people were injured, further incidents in Cartagena, Asturias and on the Rodalies network in Cataluña have raised serious concerns about the rail infrastructure. The incident in Rodiales claimed the life of one driver and left more than 30 injured. The latest issues show the scale of the problems with Spain's rail network.

Rodalies services in Cataluña are still struggling after the landslide in Gelida forced the network to shut down while train drivers called for safety checks. Services have started to resume, but further faults at the Centro de Tráfico Centralizado at Barcelona's Estació de França are causing repeated cancellations and delays.

Across the network, landslides, power failures and other infrastructure problems continue to cause disruption, with some services temporarily halted.

Protests have been threatened in Barcelona, warning that the ongoing chaos on Rodalies is hitting daily life and the local economy hard.

Delays and disruptions continue throughout Spain

Further disruption has been reported, this time in Bilbao, where some lines have been suspended due to a power outage. This latest incident happened at 8.15am on Tuesday January 27.

On the high-speed network, services between Madrid and Galicia continue to operate, although Renfe warns that journey times may be longer than usual due to recent adverse weather conditions. As a result, passengers are being offered free changes and refunds if they choose not to travel.

Adif maintains a temporary speed restriction of 160kmh on the Ourense-Santiago section of the line, which is expected to remain in place for around 48 hours. While high-speed trains continue to run, regional services in Galicia remain suspended due to the weather.

On the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed line, Adif confirms that the crack detected near l'Espluga de Francolí (Tarragona) has now been repaired. Following the repair, the maximum speed has been increased to 230 km/h, after having been reduced to 80 km/h as a precaution.

Issues persist on the Madrid-Sevilla high-speed line near Almodóvar del Río (Córdoba). Elsewhere in Andalucía, incidents on the medium-distance line between Córdoba and Jaén continue to affect services, with replacement buses operating between affected stations.

Rail workers in Mallorca are planning partial strikes, saying the service is underfunded, short-staffed and facing ongoing safety problems.

With investigations into the Adamuz crash and the incidents that followed still ongoing, Spain's rail network is under pressure. Passengers should make sure to check travel updates as the disruption continues.

New faults on AVE and commuter lines add to the growing list of incidents across Spain's rail network

Spain's rail crisis continues as new incidents on commuter, medium-distance and high-speed lines add to ongoing disruption across the network, following the fatal train crash in Adamuz (Córdoba).

Since this tragic incident, where 45 people lost their lives and 152 people were injured, further incidents in Cartagena, Asturias and on the Rodalies network in Cataluña have raised serious concerns about the rail infrastructure. The incident in Rodiales claimed the life of one driver and left more than 30 injured. The latest issues show the scale of the problems with Spain's rail network.

Rodalies services in Cataluña are still struggling after the landslide in Gelida forced the network to shut down while train drivers called for safety checks. Services have started to resume, but further faults at the Centro de Tráfico Centralizado at Barcelona's Estació de França are causing repeated cancellations and delays.

Across the network, landslides, power failures and other infrastructure problems continue to cause disruption, with some services temporarily halted.

Protests have been threatened in Barcelona, warning that the ongoing chaos on Rodalies is hitting daily life and the local economy hard.

Further disruption has been reported, this time in Bilbao, where some lines have been suspended due to a power outage. This latest incident happened at 8.15am on Tuesday January 27.

On the high-speed network, services between Madrid and Galicia continue to operate, although Renfe warns that journey times may be longer than usual due to recent adverse weather conditions. As a result, passengers are being offered free changes and refunds if they choose not to travel.

Adif maintains a temporary speed restriction of 160kmh on the Ourense-Santiago section of the line, which is expected to remain in place for around 48 hours. While high-speed trains continue to run, regional services in Galicia remain suspended due to the weather.

On the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed line, Adif confirms that the crack detected near l'Espluga de Francolí (Tarragona) has now been repaired. Following the repair, the maximum speed has been increased to 230 km/h, after having been reduced to 80 km/h as a precaution.

Issues persist on the Madrid-Sevilla high-speed line near Almodóvar del Río (Córdoba). Elsewhere in Andalucía, incidents on the medium-distance line between Córdoba and Jaén continue to affect services, with replacement buses operating between affected stations.

Rail workers in Mallorca are planning partial strikes, saying the service is underfunded, short-staffed and facing ongoing safety problems.

With investigations into the Adamuz crash and the incidents that followed still ongoing, Spain's rail network is under pressure. Passengers should make sure to check travel updates as the disruption continues.","Spain's rail crisis continues as new incidents affect high-speed and commuter services

Pedestrian fatally hit by train near Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive

ONTARIO, CA, (January 25, 2026) - A 43-year-old man tragically died Sunday morning in a train vs. pedestrian accident in Ontario, according to a coroner's press release from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.

Jamaal Scott died Sunday morning in a train vs. pedestrian accident near Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive in Ontario. Incident Location

The report says Jamaal Lionel Scott was hit by a train near Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive at approximately 10:49 a.m.

Sadly, Scott was declared dead at the scene.

Additional details were not initially released.

The Ontario Police Department is investigating.

FATAL PEDESTRIAN TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION Train accidents such as this can occur for several reasons, including train personnel error, train track failure, a mechanical error or malfunction, a signalman error, and reckless actions. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the crash site was made safe for the pedestrian crossing. According to the National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB), approximately 1,000 people are killed in train-related accidents each year. Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, said that in cases such as this that it is imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer as soon as possible to preserve evidence for a victim's family. “A skilled attorney can protect a grieving family from powerful train companies, which often send their investigators to crash sites and possess a variety of resources they can utilize to defend a negligent party,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal and national analyst for The Legal Advocate.

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM Pending results of the investigation, the family of Jamaal Scott may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of love and companionship, pain, suffering and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident. “The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand just what families are forced to go through, and having their rights protected is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that their legal rights and best interests are protected.”
