SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities. The Kern County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as Gerardo Becerra Perez, a resident of Shafter. Law enforcement officials said Perez was hit by a train near the intersection of South Beech Avenue and East Los Angeles Avenue. Officers responded to the scene at approximately 9:34 a.m., where Perez was pronounced dead. The circumstances leading up to the collision were not immediately released, and the incident remains under investigation.



 Each year, hundreds of lives are lost in train-related incidents across the United States, many occurring at crossings with limited warning signs, faulty signals, or inadequate fencing. According to the National Safety Council, railroad fatalities reached 954 in 2024, reflecting a 1% decrease from the revised 2023 total of 967. Candice Bond, a seasoned train accident attorney, emphasized the importance of conducting an independent investigation promptly following a fatal crash to help preserve critical evidence for a victim’s family. “An experienced attorney can help shield grieving families from large railroad companies, which often deploy their own investigative teams and have extensive resources to defend against claims,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “Acting quickly is crucial in these cases to ensure that all evidence is properly examined,” Bond added. 

 Pending the outcome of the investigation, surviving family members of Gerardo Becerra Perez may have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim. In such cases, families may seek compensation for loss of companionship, emotional distress, and the pain and suffering caused by the sudden loss of a loved one. “The emotional toll following the unexpected death of a family member can be devastating,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “A wrongful death attorney can closely monitor the investigation while working to protect the legal rights and interests of the victim’s family,” Formica said."

A California congressman is calling for more railroad oversight. It comes on the three-year anniversary of one of the nation's most destructive railway accidents and just a day after a derailment in Stockton.
Most of the 17,000 Pacific Gas and Electric customers now have power restored following Monday's train accident in the Stockton railyards. But that mishap highlights the impact a train derailment can have on nearby communities.
""Millions of Americans live and work along hazmat railways,"" said Ed Kelly, general president of the International Association of Firefighters. ""We need to protect them.""
This week marks the three-year anniversary of the fire and explosion in East Palestine, Ohio, that was caused by a train derailment.
Congressman John Garamendi says similar tanker cars carrying flammable chemicals regularly come through Davis, Sacramento, and other Northern California communities.
""And we've had our share of almost-serious accidents,"" Garamendi said.
He is co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would require new railroad safety standards.
""This rail safety bill covers sensible things,"" Garamendi said. ""It's not complex, but it is very, very important.""
It would mandate having at least two crew members on board trains. It also requires railroads to install defect detectors that can spot mechanical problems, and it would force railroads to fund more hazmat training for first responders.
""Too often, firefighters arrive at train derailments with limited information and limited training,"" Kelly said.
Penalties for safety violations would also be increased.
The Association of American Railroads says there's no proven safety benefit to justify the cost of requiring two crew members. They oppose these kinds of regulations and want to adopt modern technologies to enhance safety benefits.
But bill supporters say more work needs to be done to protect communities from any more railway disasters.
The authors of the bill are trying to get it included in a vote for the new federal surface transportation reauthorization act."

In a letter to the City Council Nick Mehta, Summer’s father, said he supports closing the intersection, believing Churchill provided an “easy means for her to impulsively act at a low moment.”

The letter was read by a friend of Nick Mehta’s during tonight’s council meeting.

The Caltrain crossing at Churchill Avenue and Alma Street is adjacent to Palo Alto High School, and has been the site of multiple student suicides over the past few years.

“It is too late for my daughter but it is not too late for others,” Nick Mehta wrote.

In response, Mayor Vicki Veenker said tonight that an The Rail Safety/Youth Mental Health ad hoc committee has been created to look into ramping up safety measures at the intersection, and the logistics of shutting it down, an action that Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin urged the council to do in a Thursday letter.

The committee consists of council members Julie Lythcott-Haims, Pat Burt and Greer Stone.

Lythcott-Haims said the committee has already met with Caltrain and other city transportation safety officials to explore their options, which included talks about installing more high-tech cameras that can detect unusual movements on the tracks and paying security guards to monitor the intersection. The committee will meet again this week, Lythcott-Haims said.

But several residents said they also want council to shut the Churchill crossing immediately, and not wait for the committee’s insights and recommendation.

A resident who identified herself as Bre. T said her daughter was Summer’s friend and is “begging” the council to close the intersection.

“Failing to close is a complacency I just can’t tolerate as a mom anymore,” she said.

Prior to the ad hoc meeting, Caltrain and Palo Alto were working on installing new technologies at Churchill crossings to improve safety, including using AI to help detect and alert officials about lingering cars and pedestrians on the tracks. Other potential updates include a partial underpass to reduce car and pedestrian traffic and grade separation, which would require temporarily closing the crossing."

Local Context

The incident occurred along the coastal railroad corridor between Lookout Park and Fernald Point near Summerland in Santa Barbara County. This stretch of track runs close to shoreline communities and recreational areas, including Lookout Park, and is used regularly by freight and passenger trains traveling through the region. When a train-related injury is reported in this area, responders from agencies such as the Montecito Fire Protection District must coordinate access along the tracks, which can be more difficult than roadway incidents. Temporary rail shutdowns may also affect service schedules while authorities secure the scene and conduct their investigation.

What to Do Next

If you witness a rail-related emergency, call 911 immediately and provide the exact location, including nearby landmarks such as Lookout Park or Fernald Point. Remain at a safe distance from railroad tracks and avoid attempting to approach or assist unless directed by emergency personnel. Write down what you observed, including train direction and timing, while the details are still fresh. Check official transit or rail advisories for updates if you plan to travel through the affected corridor.

FAQ

Q: Why are details sometimes limited right after a train accident?

A: Early information is often preliminary while investigators review scene evidence, speak with train operators and witnesses, and confirm the sequence of events.

Q: Are train-pedestrian crashes typically severe?

A: Collisions involving trains often result in serious injuries due to the size and speed of rail equipment, which can limit stopping distance.

Q: Can railroad operations be suspended after an incident?

A: Yes. Rail traffic may be temporarily halted so emergency crews can safely assist victims and investigators can examine the scene before service resumes."

Local Context
The incident occurred along the coastal railroad corridor between Lookout Park and Fernald Point near Summerland in Santa Barbara County. This stretch of track runs close to shoreline communities and recreational areas, including Lookout Park, and is used regularly by freight and passenger trains traveling through the region. When a train-related injury is reported in this area, responders from agencies such as the Montecito Fire Protection District must coordinate access along the tracks, which can be more difficult than roadway incidents. Temporary rail shutdowns may also affect service schedules while authorities secure the scene and conduct their investigation.
What to Do Next
- If you witness a rail-related emergency, call 911 immediately and provide the exact location, including nearby landmarks such as Lookout Park or Fernald Point.
- Remain at a safe distance from railroad tracks and avoid attempting to approach or assist unless directed by emergency personnel.
- Write down what you observed, including train direction and timing, while the details are still fresh.
- Check official transit or rail advisories for updates if you plan to travel through the affected corridor.
FAQ
Q: Why are details sometimes limited right after a train accident?
A: Early information is often preliminary while investigators review scene evidence, speak with train operators and witnesses, and confirm the sequence of events.
Q: Are train-pedestrian crashes typically severe?
A: Collisions involving trains often result in serious injuries due to the size and speed of rail equipment, which can limit stopping distance.
Q: Can railroad operations be suspended after an incident?
A: Yes. Rail traffic may be temporarily halted so emergency crews can safely assist victims and investigators can examine the scene before service resumes."
