On January 26, 2005, Southern California’s morning commute was shattered when a Metrolink passenger train struck a vehicle left on the tracks near Chevy Chase Drive on the Glendale–Los Angeles boundary. The collision set off a chain of derailments and secondary impacts involving three trains, leaving 11 people dead and roughly 180 others injured, one of the region’s most devastating commuter-rail tragedies.
The southbound Metrolink train involved was Ventura County Line train #100, operating in push-pull service with a cab car leading. A Jeep Cherokee had been driven onto the railroad right of way and abandoned on the track a short distance beyond the grade crossing, and the train hit it at around the start of the rush hour. Investigators later treated the vehicle’s placement on the track as a criminal act, and the driver survived.
The impact did not end at the point of collision. Debris from the vehicle and the forces involved contributed to Metrolink #100 derailing, and the derailed consist then struck an unoccupied Union Pacific gravel/work train that had been left standing on a siding nearby. The sequence continued as the Metrolink train jackknifed and collided with passing Metrolink train #901 traveling in the opposite direction, derailing equipment across multiple tracks.
Witness accounts and official summaries described a chaotic scene in darkness and early light, with wrecked cars, twisted metal, and a fire burning near the front of the commuter consist. Passengers were forced to find their way out through damaged cars while emergency calls poured in. Some of the first help came from workers at the nearby Costco, who climbed the perimeter fence, brought fire extinguishers, and assisted victims before the full emergency response was in place.
The response quickly expanded into a major multi-agency operation, with large numbers of fire and medical units converging from surrounding jurisdictions. Helicopters were used as part of the response, and investigators and rescuers worked the site as both an accident scene and a crime scene. The scale of the casualties and the complexity of three derailed trains made the work of searching, triage, and recovery both urgent and prolonged.
In the months and years that followed, the crash became inseparable from the criminal case against Juan Manuel Álvarez, who was accused of leaving the Jeep on the track. In 2008, he was convicted of 11 counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances and one count of arson, and he was sentenced to 11 consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Each January 26, the date endures as a grim marker for commuters and rail workers alike: a reminder of how a single act on the tracks can ripple outward into irreversible loss.",tf_url

SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities. The Kern County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as Gerardo Becerra Perez, a resident of Shafter. Law enforcement officials said Perez was hit by a train near the intersection of South Beech Avenue and East Los Angeles Avenue. Officers responded to the scene at approximately 9:34 a.m., where Perez was pronounced dead. The circumstances leading up to the collision were not immediately released, and the incident remains under investigation.



 Each year, hundreds of lives are lost in train-related incidents across the United States, many occurring at crossings with limited warning signs, faulty signals, or inadequate fencing. According to the National Safety Council, railroad fatalities reached 954 in 2024, reflecting a 1% decrease from the revised 2023 total of 967. Candice Bond, a seasoned train accident attorney, emphasized the importance of conducting an independent investigation promptly following a fatal crash to help preserve critical evidence for a victim’s family. “An experienced attorney can help shield grieving families from large railroad companies, which often deploy their own investigative teams and have extensive resources to defend against claims,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “Acting quickly is crucial in these cases to ensure that all evidence is properly examined,” Bond added. 

 Pending the outcome of the investigation, surviving family members of Gerardo Becerra Perez may have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim. In such cases, families may seek compensation for loss of companionship, emotional distress, and the pain and suffering caused by the sudden loss of a loved one. “The emotional toll following the unexpected death of a family member can be devastating,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “A wrongful death attorney can closely monitor the investigation while working to protect the legal rights and interests of the victim’s family,” Formica said.",gs_url

Deadly Crash Shuts Down Folsom Light Rail

A deadly crash shuts down Folsom light rail near Iron Point Station on Thursday afternoon, January 22, 2026, disrupting Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) service. A vehicle struck the station ramp and overturned onto the tracks, blocking service between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom stations.

Folsom police confirmed that a pedestrian was killed, and another individual was transported to a hospital for treatment. SacRT crews inspected the tracks for damage before resuming normal service around 8 p.m., with a bus bridge in place to maintain transit along the affected route.

Footage from the scene showed the sedan resting at an angle across the tracks, with damage to the station parking lot, indicating a violent collision through the area prior to impacting the tracks.

Be vigilant for pedestrians in high-traffic transit zones.

Avoid distractions while driving, especially near busy stations with foot traffic.

Yield to emergency responders and follow detours when incidents occur.

Over the weekend, her father James Weems said he received a call telling him his daughter had been struck by a driver at the Iron Point Light Rail Station. He visited the crash site Sunday night and struggled to understand how the car struck his daughter before ending up on the tracks, he said.

""I hope she didn't see it coming. Because, I try to think about that. That's what I was trying to see last night. But I couldn't see it,"" Weems said.

""I've tried to make some sort of sense of it and all that kind of stuff, but it's kind of hard,"" Weems said through tears.

Steffy was reportedly on her way to work as a dance instructor at the Hawkins School of Performing Arts in Folsom. Dance was part of her life from an early age, her father said.

Steffy was well known in the local dance community, including at The Torch Club, where her friends said she was a regular on Sundays and recognized for her dance moves.

Abigail Gibson, Steffy's friend, said she brought energy wherever she went and was passionate about dance, the people she taught and the community she built.

""She was just the life of the party everywhere she went,"" Gibson said. ""It was kind of impossible to be in a bad mood around her. She was always moving, always singing, always dancing.""

""Everything is still all in the works. This is all very sudden, but right now we're trying to contribute all community funds to further her legacy, especially in the arts, specifically with dance and children, kind of furthering the love that she loved to give to everyone,"" Weber said.

Weems said his hope is that his daughter left a lasting impression on the children she taught and that their futures reflect the impact she had on them.

GLENDALE, Calif. (KABC) -- A pregnant woman was killed Wednesday morning in a violent collision involving a Metrolink train and a car at a crossing in Glendale.

The crash was reported shortly after 9 a.m. on Brazil Street, just west of the intersection of San Fernando Road and Broadway, between the Burbank Downtown and the Glendale stations, according to Metrolink.

The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to the Glendale Police Department, the sedan was traveling northbound on West San Fernando Road when the driver attempted to make a right turn onto Broadway, which turns into Brazil Street at that point.

""As the vehicle entered the crossing, it was struck by a Metrolink train traveling on the tracks,"" police said in a statement.

The downtown L.A.-bound train, number 206 on the Antelope Valley Line, was stopped on the tracks for hours after the collision.

A male pedestrian who was in the immediate area was struck by an object as a result of debris from the collision, police said. He was transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

""There are approximately 150 passengers on train 206, though no injuries have been reported aboard at this time,"" Metrolink said in a statement issued shortly after 10 a.m.

Trains 207 and 208 on the Antelope Valley Line were canceled, as were trains 320 and 341 on the San Bernardino Line. Metro buses were used to shuttle passengers between the Burbank Downtown and Glendale stations.

 A pregnant woman was killed, and four others were injured after a train slammed into a car that was crossing the tracks in California.


 According to police in Glendale, Calif., a city bordering Los Angeles, the crash involved a Metrolink train that was traveling from the Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles at around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 4.


 Police said that a driver attempted to make a turn from the city's West San Fernando Road onto Broadway, crossing the railroad tracks.


 As the car entered the railroad crossing, it was hit by Metrolink train 206, police wrote in a statement shared to Facebook.



 Police and fire personnel were called to the scene, and the driver, identified as 35-year-old Zukhra Kurbanova, by authorities and FOX Los Angeles, was pronounced dead at the scene.


 ABC7 and KTLA reported after the crash that Kurbanova was pregnant.


 Additionally, police said that a man walking nearby was struck by debris. His injuries were not life-threatening, and he was taken to a local hospital.


 Metrolink told the outlets that three passengers aboard the train also reported injuries, including one person who was hospitalized and two who were treated by emergency personnel on the train.


 Footage from the local news outlets showed fire and police officials at the scene as the car, a silver sedan, sat on the tracks as the railroad's safety arms were down. The vehicle was heavily damaged, and its airbags were deployed.


 ""There are approximately 150 passengers on train 206, though no injuries have been reported aboard at this time,"" the rail operator told ABC7 in a statement.


 The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office told PEOPLE that the decedent was a resident of Glendale, and an exam has been scheduled.



 When reached for comment, the Glendale Police Department said they could not release the identity of the deceased until the coroner's office's part of the investigation was complete.


 ""Additionally, this complex investigation will require some more time and our traffic investigator’s opinion as to why will be deferred until then,"" they added. ""We do have knowledge that the arms at the tracks were in fact operational and operating at the time the driver made the right turn.""

Indio Man Killed After Being Struck by Train, Authorities Say
A local alert this evening as authorities confirm that an Indio man has died after being struck by a train late last night.
The Riverside County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as Noel Tapia of Indio. Officials say Tapia was hit by a train while on the tracks between Indio Boulevard and Hoover Street.
The incident happened just after midnight, according to investigators. Emergency responders transported Tapia to a hospital in Palm Springs, where he later died from his injuries.
A representative from Union Pacific Railroad said Tapia was trespassing on the tracks at the time of the incident for unspecified reasons.
The circumstances surrounding why Tapia was on the tracks remain under investigation. Authorities have not released further details at this time.
Officials continue to remind the public that railroad tracks are private property and can be extremely dangerous, urging residents to stay clear of train corridors at all times.

A California congressman is calling for more railroad oversight. It comes on the three-year anniversary of one of the nation's most destructive railway accidents and just a day after a derailment in Stockton.
Most of the 17,000 Pacific Gas and Electric customers now have power restored following Monday's train accident in the Stockton railyards. But that mishap highlights the impact a train derailment can have on nearby communities.
""Millions of Americans live and work along hazmat railways,"" said Ed Kelly, general president of the International Association of Firefighters. ""We need to protect them.""
This week marks the three-year anniversary of the fire and explosion in East Palestine, Ohio, that was caused by a train derailment.
Congressman John Garamendi says similar tanker cars carrying flammable chemicals regularly come through Davis, Sacramento, and other Northern California communities.
""And we've had our share of almost-serious accidents,"" Garamendi said.
He is co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would require new railroad safety standards.
""This rail safety bill covers sensible things,"" Garamendi said. ""It's not complex, but it is very, very important.""
It would mandate having at least two crew members on board trains. It also requires railroads to install defect detectors that can spot mechanical problems, and it would force railroads to fund more hazmat training for first responders.
""Too often, firefighters arrive at train derailments with limited information and limited training,"" Kelly said.
Penalties for safety violations would also be increased.
The Association of American Railroads says there's no proven safety benefit to justify the cost of requiring two crew members. They oppose these kinds of regulations and want to adopt modern technologies to enhance safety benefits.
But bill supporters say more work needs to be done to protect communities from any more railway disasters.
The authors of the bill are trying to get it included in a vote for the new federal surface transportation reauthorization act.",tf_url

Santa Barbara County, CA – A man was hospitalized after being hit by a freight train near Summerland in Santa Barbara County on Tuesday afternoon.
According to the authorities, the accident was reported just after 5 p.m. February 10, between Lookout Park and Fernald Point.
Firefighters with the Montecito Fire Protection District and other emergency personnel responded to the scene and found a pedestrian on the railroad tracks.
Preliminary reports indicate that a freight train had hit the victim but the circumstances under which the accident happened were yet to be established.
The victim was given first aid before being transported to Lookout Park. He was then loaded onto an AMR ambulance and taken Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.
As per the Montecito Fire (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.montecitofire.com/&ved=2ahUKEwj4v6z20dGSAxXs5ckDHQVpOVwQFnoECCAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3PjfMXvgQhh0AIwPU5isjF) officials, the pedestrian was transported with serious injuries. There was no update on the victim’s identity at the time of the report.
The railroad tracks were temporarily shut down in the area while investigations into the incident were ongoing. The tracks had reopened as of 7 p.m.
Authorities are currently working to find out how and why the pedestrian was hit by the train.
Between 2021 and 2023, pedestrian collision counts in the City of Santa Barbara showed some variation but remained a consistent concern in the city’s overall traffic safety profile. According to OTS, the number of pedestrians killed or injured in fatal and injury collisions was 39 in 2021, rose slightly to 40 in 2022, and increased again to 41 in 2023. Throughout these years, the city’s statewide ranking for pedestrian involvement stayed within the top ten among similar-sized California cities, illustrating persistent risk exposure for people on foot. Older adult (65+) pedestrian victims rose from 2 in 2021 to 9 in 2023, suggesting a demographic shift in vulnerability. Younger pedestrian counts remained low. Broader city planning efforts, including Vision Zero pedestrian safety strategies, reflect local recognition of these patterns and aim to reduce collisions on priority corridors where pedestrian interactions with vehicles are frequent. These modest year-over-year changes underscore that while totals have been stable, serious pedestrian collision involvement remains a safety priority in Santa Barbara.

Google Streetview photo.

BY STEPHANIE LAMDaily Post Correspondent
Palo Alto community members are urging City Council to close the intersection where Churchill Avenue intersects with the railroad tracks after a Caltrain hit and killed 17-year-old Summer Devi Mehta last Tuesday.
In a letter to the City Council Nick Mehta, Summer’s father, said he supports closing the intersection, believing Churchill provided an “easy means for her to impulsively act at a low moment.”
The letter was read by a friend of Nick Mehta’s during tonight’s council meeting. 
The Caltrain crossing at Churchill Avenue and Alma Street is adjacent to Palo Alto High School, and has been the site of multiple student suicides over the past few years. 
“It is too late for my daughter but it is not too late for others,” Nick Mehta wrote. 
In response, Mayor Vicki Veenker said tonight that an The Rail Safety/Youth Mental Health ad hoc committee has been created to look into ramping up safety measures at the intersection, and the logistics of shutting it down, an action that Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin urged the council to do in a Thursday letter.
The committee consists of council members Julie Lythcott-Haims, Pat Burt and Greer Stone.
Lythcott-Haims said the committee has already met with Caltrain and other city transportation safety officials to explore their options, which included talks about installing more high-tech cameras that can detect unusual movements on the tracks and paying security guards to monitor the intersection. The committee will meet again this week, Lythcott-Haims said. 
But several residents said they also want council to shut the Churchill crossing immediately, and not wait for the committee’s insights and recommendation.
A resident who identified herself as Bre. T said her daughter was Summer’s friend and is “begging” the council to close the intersection.
“Failing to close is a complacency I just can’t tolerate as a mom anymore,” she said.
Prior to the ad hoc meeting, Caltrain and Palo Alto were working on installing new technologies at Churchill crossings to improve safety, including using AI to help detect and alert officials about lingering cars and pedestrians on the tracks. Other potential updates include a partial underpass to reduce car and pedestrian traffic and grade separation, which would require temporarily closing the crossing.",rd_url

05.02.2026
NTSB rail accident reports and investigative updates have come out in recent weeks, alongside several public dockets tied to ongoing rail accidents, as summarized by Progressive Railroading.
The updates span MARTA track protection procedures, an HSI Port of Stockton rerailing accident, and conductor injuries connected to switching or shoving movements.
NTSB rail accident reports: key findings and updates
One report centers on an Oct. 19, 2024, incident in Atlanta involving Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). The NTSB concluded that MARTA track protection procedures were insufficient for the location and type of work being performed.
Don’t miss…1000th U-trough milestone for Victoria’s rail bridges
A technician working on wayside train approach lights was struck by a MARTA train. Investigators said the procedures did not provide adequate warning time for technicians to move to safety before the train arrived, consistent with the NTSB Railroad Investigation Report (RIR2602). The NTSB also cited a contributing factor: the designated lookout was performing tasks not consistent with his duties, which meant the oncoming train was not detected in time.
HSI Port of Stockton rerailing accident
The NTSB also issued findings on a March 11, 2025, accident involving Hulcher Services Inc. (HSI) at the Port of Stockton in California. The board determined the probable cause was the lack of a standardized process for how and where a crew member should be safely positioned when operating a hand brake during a rerailing operation.
According to the NTSB, an HSI assistant division manager trainee was seriously hurt while working as part of an eight-person crew rerailing four rail cars that had derailed. After the accident, HSI added a new rule to its safe practices handbook and incorporated it into its standard operating procedures.
Public dockets for Union Pacific and R. J. Corman cases
In addition to investigation reports, the NTSB opened the public docket for its ongoing investigation of a June 25, 2025, accident in Lexington, Nebraska, involving a Union Pacific Railroad conductor. The conductor was seriously injured while riding the lead tank car during a shoving movement.
The NTSB also opened a public docket for its ongoing investigation of a June 26, 2025, accident at Guthrie Yard in Guthrie, Kentucky. The case involves an R. J. Corman Railway Group conductor who was seriously injured during a rail-car switching operation. Although the docket has been opened, it has not been released as of today.
BNSF grade crossing welding truck accident near New Rockford
Another NTSB investigation report addressed a Nov. 4, 2024, accident near New Rockford, North Dakota, involving BNSF Railway employees. A BNSF Railway maintenance-of-way employee was fatally struck by a BNSF freight train while driving a welding truck across a highway–railroad grade crossing, and another maintenance-of-way employee in the passenger seat was injured.
The NTSB determined the probable cause was the welding team’s failure to detect the approaching BNSF freight train as they backed the welding truck over the private grade crossing.
A contributing factor was the team’s noncompliance with, and lack of understanding of, BNSF’s safety rule S-12.8; Railway Supply also summarizes the NTSB’s conclusions in its coverage of the case, NTSB final report BNSF collision: N.D. crash findings. After the accident, BNSF clarified the backing rule.

WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Charles E Peck died on impact in the 2008 Metrolink disaster in California, but his mobile phone mysteriously made 35 calls to loved ones over 11 hours, ultimately helping locate his body

In a heartbreaking and bewildering night for his relatives, one father-of-three's mobile continued trying to contact his family following his tragic death in a train collision.

‌



Charles E Peck was amongst those who died in the catastrophic San Fernando Valley Metrolink incident which came to be known as the Chatsworth crash.

‌



Peck was recently engaged to Andrea Katz and the 49-year-old had three youngsters from a former marriage.

‌



On 12 September 2008 at 4:22pm the passenger train transporting 225 travellers collided at a combined velocity of 83 mph with a cargo train operated by a three-person crew, according to Snopes.

Tragically, there were 135 individuals wounded, 87 of whom were taken to hospital, with 46 in critical condition. Devastatingly, 25 died, reports the Mirror US.

‌



Peck, a customer service representative for Delta Air Lines at Salt Lake City International Airport died on impact. However, eerily, his mobile phone told a different story.

The 49 year old had travelled to Los Angeles for a job interview at Van Nuys Airport - he was seeking fresh employment in California so he could wed his Westlake Village fiancée.

Horrifically, Katz discovered the crash on the radio whilst she was travelling to collect Peck from the station. She was with his parents and siblings.

‌



Distressingly, his family began to receive telephone calls from Peck. For 11 hours they were bombarded with agonising calls from his phone, ringing his son, his brother, his stepmother, his sister, and his fiancée.

A disturbing total of 35 calls from the phone were made throughout the night - whilst his family remained unsure whether he was dead or alive. The phone calls provided the grieving relatives with hope that he was still living and merely trapped.

Upon answering the mysterious calls, all they could hear was static, and when they rang back, the calls went directly to voicemail.

‌



Eventually, Peck's body was retrieved from the wreckage 12 hours following the accident.

The flurry of calls prompted search teams to track the location of the phone through its signal and to examine once more what remained of the first train, the place from which the calls were originating.

The searchers ultimately located Peck's body roughly an hour after the calls from his mobile phone ended.

‌



Chillingly, it was revealed Peck died on impact - and his phone continued working beyond his death to contact those he cherished most.

Crucially, these calls also ensured his body was found, though his phone was never recovered.

A preliminary inquiry into the deadliest incident in Metrolink's history determined that the engineer operating the commuter train had failed to acknowledge a red signal.

GLENDALE, CA, (February 04, 2026) - The Glendale Police Department said a 35-year-old woman was killed in a crash with a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train along Brazil Street on Wednesday morning.

Zukhra Kurbanova, 35, was killed Wednesday morning when her vehicle was struck by a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train at a crossing in Glendale.


She was identified by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner as Zukhra Kurbanova.
The crash occurred just west of the intersection of San Fernando Road and Broadway.
Kurbanova was driving a vehicle northbound on West San Fernando when she attempted to make a right turn onto Broadway around 9 a.m. and was struck by a Metrolink train traveling on the tracks. Tragically, she died at the scene from her injuries. The train was carrying roughly 150 passengers, three of whom were injured. One person was transported to a hospital. A bystander struck by debris from the crash was also hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.
Two trains, each on the Antelope Valley and San Bernardino lines, were canceled after the collision.
This is an ongoing investigation.CRASH INVESTIGATION NEEDED
Train accidents such as this can occur for several reasons, including train personnel error, train track failure, a mechanical error or malfunction, a signalman error, and reckless actions.
Each year, train-related crashes claim hundreds of lives across the United States. Many of these fatalities result from poorly marked crossings, malfunctioning signals and inadequate fencing. Railroad deaths totaled 954 in 2024, a 1% decrease from the 2023 revised total of 967, the National Safety Council said in a report. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the crash site was made safe for the crossing. 
Candice Bond, who specializes in train-related crashes, said that in cases such as this, it is imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer as soon as possible to preserve evidence for a victim's family.

Local Context

The incident occurred along the coastal railroad corridor between Lookout Park and Fernald Point near Summerland in Santa Barbara County. This stretch of track runs close to shoreline communities and recreational areas, including Lookout Park, and is used regularly by freight and passenger trains traveling through the region. When a train-related injury is reported in this area, responders from agencies such as the Montecito Fire Protection District must coordinate access along the tracks, which can be more difficult than roadway incidents. Temporary rail shutdowns may also affect service schedules while authorities secure the scene and conduct their investigation.

What to Do Next

If you witness a rail-related emergency, call 911 immediately and provide the exact location, including nearby landmarks such as Lookout Park or Fernald Point. Remain at a safe distance from railroad tracks and avoid attempting to approach or assist unless directed by emergency personnel. Write down what you observed, including train direction and timing, while the details are still fresh. Check official transit or rail advisories for updates if you plan to travel through the affected corridor.

FAQ

Q: Why are details sometimes limited right after a train accident?

A: Early information is often preliminary while investigators review scene evidence, speak with train operators and witnesses, and confirm the sequence of events.

Q: Are train-pedestrian crashes typically severe?

A: Collisions involving trains often result in serious injuries due to the size and speed of rail equipment, which can limit stopping distance.

Q: Can railroad operations be suspended after an incident?

A: Yes. Rail traffic may be temporarily halted so emergency crews can safely assist victims and investigators can examine the scene before service resumes.",np_url
