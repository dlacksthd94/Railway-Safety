Pedestrian Killed After Being Struck by Train Near Chico State Campus

A pedestrian killed after being struck by train near Chico State early Monday morning, February 9, 2026, according to the Chico Police Department. The fatal collision occurred at approximately 1:51 a.m. near West Sacramento Avenue and North Cedar Street, close to the Chico State campus and nearby student housing.

What Happened

Police officers responding to the scene found an adult male deceased on the railroad tracks. Authorities reported that the engineer of a northbound Amtrak train saw a person on the tracks but was unable to stop the train in time to avoid the collision.

Witness interviews and preliminary findings indicate there were no suspicious circumstances leading up to the incident, though the investigation remains ongoing. The train remained stopped at the scene for approximately two hours, while vehicle traffic in the surrounding area was not impacted.

Chico police stated that the man is not believed to be a Chico State student. The Butte County Sheriff’s Office has taken custody of the remains, and the victim’s identity is being withheld pending notification of next of kin.

Investigation Ongoing

Authorities have a preliminary identification of the deceased but will not release the name until family members are notified. Law enforcement continues to review the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Railroad & Pedestrian Safety

Railroad tracks are extremely dangerous areas, particularly at night when visibility is limited. Trains require long distances to stop and cannot maneuver to avoid pedestrians. Individuals are urged to stay clear of tracks at all times, obey posted warnings, and avoid walking near rail lines, especially in low-light conditions.

A semitruck collided with a Metrolink train in an agricultural area of Moorpark on Wednesday afternoon, killing the truck driver and sending one of the train passengers to the hospital, authorities said.
Metrolink train 118 struck a truck and trailer at a crossing on private farmland near the intersection of Los Angeles Avenue and Montair Drive at 2:15 p.m., according to a Metrolink spokesperson. The truck driver was pronounced dead at the scene, and one of the train's 11 passengers was transported to a local hospital for treatment in unknown condition, the spokesperson said.
The truck was severely damaged in the collision. A section of the vehicle was pushed one-third of a mile down the track, said Fire Department spokesperson Andy VanSciver. All five train cars and the engine remained upright on the tracks following the collision.

The cause of the accident is currently unknown. Train crossings on agricultural land in Ventura County are typically marked with stop signs and signs directing drivers to look both ways, said VanSciver.
As a result of the collision, Metrolink service that regularly operates to Ventura East Station was only operating as far as Moorpark. Metrolink on Wednesday afternoon was working to provide alternative transportation and Uber vouchers to affected customers, who can call their customer hotline at (800) 371-5465 for assistance.

Safety Tips Around Railroad Crossings
Railroad incidents are often catastrophic due to the size and stopping distance of trains. Drivers can help reduce the risk by:
- Never stopping or parking on railroad tracks
- Obeying all crossing signals, gates, and warning lights
- Looking both ways before crossing, even if signals are not active
- Avoiding distractions and staying alert near rail crossings
- Exiting the vehicle immediately and moving away from the tracks if a car becomes stuck
Trains require a long distance to come to a complete stop, making early caution essential.

These cases highlight the complex legal landscape families face when seeking accountability and compensation after unexpected fatalities, especially when questions of negligence or liability arise.

On February 17, 2026, a 58-year-old woman was killed in a train collision near State Route 65 and Dairy Road in Wheatland, Yuba County, when a freight train struck her Toyota Prius. Authorities confirmed the driver was outside her vehicle at the time of impact. Just days later, on February 21, 2026, a massive avalanche in the remote Sierra Nevada wilderness claimed eight lives and left one presumed dead during a guided backcountry ski trip. Both incidents are under active investigation, raising profound questions about the circumstances leading to these deaths and the potential for legal recourse through wrongful death claims.

The California avalanche, which involved clients of Blackbird Mountain Guides, has sparked an unusual criminal negligence investigation by the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office, a move legal experts describe as having scant precedent. Typically, backcountry tour clients sign liability waivers that shield guide companies. However, according to Utah ski injury attorney Rob Miner, these waivers do not absolve guides of responsibility if they fail to follow appropriate safety protocols or adequately inform clients of risks. Miner emphasized, “They’re guides. It is presumed they will not guide you into an experience that may kill you, or that creates an unreasonable risk of death.”

The investigation is scrutinizing the guides’ decision to embark on the three-day trip with 11 clients amidst intensifying storm warnings and then to ski out on Tuesday as avalanche conditions worsened. This slide was the deadliest in the U.S. since 1981, making the scale and the decision-making process pivotal for investigators. Attorney Andrew McDevitt noted that while skiing is recognized as inherently dangerous, the specific circumstances of this incident are drawing a closer look. Ravn Whitington, an attorney specializing in ski injury and wrongful death cases near the avalanche site in Truckee, California, acknowledged the ongoing speculation, stating that much of what investigators know remains undisclosed to the public.

In the aftermath of the Wheatland train collision, the California Highway Patrol is actively investigating the factors that led to the vehicle being on the railroad tracks. Such incidents are often catastrophic, necessitating thorough investigations to determine all contributing factors, which can include roadway design, crossing conditions, visibility issues, or mechanical problems. In these complex scenarios, an experienced wrongful death attorney plays a crucial role in advocating for the victim’s family.

Wrongful death attorneys conduct independent investigations, working to preserve critical evidence and accident data. They often collaborate with reconstruction and safety experts to identify all potentially responsible parties, which can extend beyond the immediate incident to include third-party factors. Their expertise is vital in helping families pursue compensation for various damages, including funeral expenses, lost financial support, and the profound loss of companionship. Furthermore, these legal professionals manage communications with insurance companies and other involved entities, allowing grieving families to focus on healing without the added burden of legal complexities.

Both the avalanche and train collision cases underscore the specialized knowledge required to navigate wrongful death claims. In California, courts recognize skiing as an inherently dangerous activity, meaning recreational skiers assume certain risks. However, the unique circumstances of the guided avalanche trip, particularly the alleged disregard for severe weather warnings, could form the basis for successful claims of criminal negligence or civil liability against the guide company. Similarly, in train collisions, determining liability often involves extensive technical and legal analysis to identify all contributing factors and potentially responsible parties.

The confluence of these high-profile tragedies in California highlights the increasing demand for specialized legal counsel capable of dissecting complex accident scenarios, challenging liability waivers, and ensuring that families receive comprehensive support and justice in the face of profound loss."

Los Angeles, CA – Authorities have launched investigations into an incident where a Metro A Line train struck and injured a pedestrian at a station in Downtown Los Angeles on Monday evening.

The train reportedly struck a 50-year-old man on the tracks for unspecified reasons. The man was trapped in the incident and had to be extricated from the tracks by the firefighters.

The LAFD paramedics transported the man to a hospital with serious injuries. The man’s identity was not immediately released by the authorities.

No one else was reported to have been injured in the accident.

The LA Metro officials urged riders to alternatively use the J Line as the crash led to delays on the Metro A Line tracks.

Authorities have not released further details on the incident, which remains under investigation.

Drivers are required by law to exercise due care to avoid collisions with pedestrians. Pedestrians walking in marked and unmarked crosswalks at intersections have the right of way. Furthermore, pedestrians attempting to cross outside of the crosswalks must yield to vehicle to avoid being hit. Pedestrians should also walk facing traffic when walking on a roadway that lacks a sidewalk. These laws are put into consideration when determining fault and liability in cases of pedestrian accidents.
