Santa Barbara County, CA – A man was hospitalized after being hit by a freight train near Summerland in Santa Barbara County on Tuesday afternoon.

According to the authorities, the accident was reported just after 5 p.m. February 10, between Lookout Park and Fernald Point.

Firefighters with the Montecito Fire Protection District and other emergency personnel responded to the scene and found a pedestrian on the railroad tracks.

Preliminary reports indicate that a freight train had hit the victim but the circumstances under which the accident happened were yet to be established.

The victim was given first aid before being transported to Lookout Park. He was then loaded onto an AMR ambulance and taken Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.

In a letter to the City Council Nick Mehta, Summer’s father, said he supports closing the intersection, believing Churchill provided an “easy means for her to impulsively act at a low moment.”

The letter was read by a friend of Nick Mehta’s during tonight’s council meeting.

The Caltrain crossing at Churchill Avenue and Alma Street is adjacent to Palo Alto High School, and has been the site of multiple student suicides over the past few years.

“It is too late for my daughter but it is not too late for others,” Nick Mehta wrote.

In response, Mayor Vicki Veenker said tonight that an The Rail Safety/Youth Mental Health ad hoc committee has been created to look into ramping up safety measures at the intersection, and the logistics of shutting it down, an action that Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin urged the council to do in a Thursday letter.

The committee consists of council members Julie Lythcott-Haims, Pat Burt and Greer Stone.

Lythcott-Haims said the committee has already met with Caltrain and other city transportation safety officials to explore their options, which included talks about installing more high-tech cameras that can detect unusual movements on the tracks and paying security guards to monitor the intersection. The committee will meet again this week, Lythcott-Haims said.

But several residents said they also want council to shut the Churchill crossing immediately, and not wait for the committee’s insights and recommendation.

A resident who identified herself as Bre. T said her daughter was Summer’s friend and is “begging” the council to close the intersection.

“Failing to close is a complacency I just can’t tolerate as a mom anymore,” she said.

Prior to the ad hoc meeting, Caltrain and Palo Alto were working on installing new technologies at Churchill crossings to improve safety, including using AI to help detect and alert officials about lingering cars and pedestrians on the tracks. Other potential updates include a partial underpass to reduce car and pedestrian traffic and grade separation, which would require temporarily closing the crossing."

ONTARIO, CA, (February 04, 2026) - A 44-year-old man was tragically killed in a pedestrian-train accident Wednesday morning in Ontario.
Jose Calderon died after being struck by a Union Pacific train in the 200 block of South Cucamonga Avenue in San Bernardino County.

FATAL PEDESTRIAN-TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION
Train accidents such as this can occur for several reasons, including train personnel error, train track failure, a mechanical error or malfunction, a signalman error, and reckless actions.
According to the National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB), approximately 1,000 people are killed in train-related accidents each year. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the crash site was made safe for the pedestrian crossing.
Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, said that in cases such as this that it is imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer as soon as possible to preserve evidence for a victim's family.
“A skilled attorney can protect a grieving family from powerful train companies, which often send their investigators to crash sites and possess a variety of resources they can utilize to defend a negligent party,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal and national analyst for The Legal Advocate.
WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM
Pending results of the investigation, family members of Jose Calderon may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of love and companionship, pain, suffering and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident.
“The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand just what families are forced to go through, and having their rights protected is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that their legal rights and best interests are protected.”

GLENDALE, CA, (February 04, 2026) - The Glendale Police Department said a 35-year-old woman was killed in a crash with a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train along Brazil Street on Wednesday morning.
Zukhra Kurbanova, 35, was killed Wednesday morning when her vehicle was struck by a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train at a crossing in Glendale.
She was identified by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner as Zukhra Kurbanova.
The crash occurred just west of the intersection of San Fernando Road and Broadway.
Kurbanova was driving a vehicle northbound on West San Fernando when she attempted to make a right turn onto Broadway around 9 a.m. and was struck by a Metrolink train traveling on the tracks. Tragically, she died at the scene from her injuries. The train was carrying roughly 150 passengers, three of whom were injured. One person was transported to a hospital. A bystander struck by debris from the crash was also hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.
Two trains, each on the Antelope Valley and San Bernardino lines, were canceled after the collision.
This is an ongoing investigation.
CRASH INVESTIGATION NEEDED
Train accidents such as this can occur for several reasons, including train personnel error, train track failure, a mechanical error or malfunction, a signalman error, and reckless actions.
Each year, train-related crashes claim hundreds of lives across the United States. Many of these fatalities result from poorly marked crossings, malfunctioning signals and inadequate fencing. Railroad deaths totaled 954 in 2024, a 1% decrease from the 2023 revised total of 967, the National Safety Council said in a report. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the crash site was made safe for the crossing.
Candice Bond, who specializes in train-related crashes, said that in cases such as this, it is imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer as soon as possible to preserve evidence for a victim's family.

Local Context

The incident occurred along the coastal railroad corridor between Lookout Park and Fernald Point near Summerland in Santa Barbara County. This stretch of track runs close to shoreline communities and recreational areas, including Lookout Park, and is used regularly by freight and passenger trains traveling through the region.

Temporary rail shutdowns may also affect service schedules while authorities secure the scene and conduct their investigation.

What to Do Next

If you witness a rail-related emergency, call 911 immediately and provide the exact location, including nearby landmarks such as Lookout Park or Fernald Point. Remain at a safe distance from railroad tracks and avoid attempting to approach or assist unless directed by emergency personnel. Write down what you observed, including train direction and timing, while the details are still fresh. Check official transit or rail advisories for updates if you plan to travel through the affected corridor.

FAQ

Q: Why are details sometimes limited right after a train accident?

A: Early information is often preliminary while investigators review scene evidence, speak with train operators and witnesses, and confirm the sequence of events.

Q: Are train-pedestrian crashes typically severe?

A: Collisions involving trains often result in serious injuries due to the size and speed of rail equipment, which can limit stopping distance.

Q: Can railroad operations be suspended after an incident?

A: Yes. Rail traffic may be temporarily halted so emergency crews can safely assist victims and investigators can examine the scene before service resumes."
