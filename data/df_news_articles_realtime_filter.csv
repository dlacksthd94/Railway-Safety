SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities. The Kern County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as Gerardo Becerra Perez, a resident of Shafter. Law enforcement officials said Perez was hit by a train near the intersection of South Beech Avenue and East Los Angeles Avenue. Officers responded to the scene at approximately 9:34 a.m., where Perez was pronounced dead. The circumstances leading up to the collision were not immediately released, and the incident remains under investigation.



 Each year, hundreds of lives are lost in train-related incidents across the United States, many occurring at crossings with limited warning signs, faulty signals, or inadequate fencing. According to the National Safety Council, railroad fatalities reached 954 in 2024, reflecting a 1% decrease from the revised 2023 total of 967. Candice Bond, a seasoned train accident attorney, emphasized the importance of conducting an independent investigation promptly following a fatal crash to help preserve critical evidence for a victim’s family. “An experienced attorney can help shield grieving families from large railroad companies, which often deploy their own investigative teams and have extensive resources to defend against claims,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “Acting quickly is crucial in these cases to ensure that all evidence is properly examined,” Bond added. 

 Pending the outcome of the investigation, surviving family members of Gerardo Becerra Perez may have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim. In such cases, families may seek compensation for loss of companionship, emotional distress, and the pain and suffering caused by the sudden loss of a loved one. “The emotional toll following the unexpected death of a family member can be devastating,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “A wrongful death attorney can closely monitor the investigation while working to protect the legal rights and interests of the victim’s family,” Formica said."

Deadly Crash Shuts Down Folsom Light Rail

A deadly crash shuts down Folsom light rail near Iron Point Station on Thursday afternoon, January 22, 2026, disrupting Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) service. A vehicle struck the station ramp and overturned onto the tracks, blocking service between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom stations.

Folsom police confirmed that a pedestrian was killed, and another individual was transported to a hospital for treatment. SacRT crews inspected the tracks for damage before resuming normal service around 8 p.m., with a bus bridge in place to maintain transit along the affected route.

Footage from the scene showed the sedan resting at an angle across the tracks, with damage to the station parking lot, indicating a violent collision through the area prior to impacting the tracks.

Over the weekend, her father James Weems said he received a call telling him his daughter had been struck by a driver at the Iron Point Light Rail Station. He visited the crash site Sunday night and struggled to understand how the car struck his daughter before ending up on the tracks, he said.

""I hope she didn't see it coming. Because, I try to think about that. That's what I was trying to see last night. But I couldn't see it,"" Weems said.

""I've tried to make some sort of sense of it and all that kind of stuff, but it's kind of hard,"" Weems said through tears.

Steffy was reportedly on her way to work as a dance instructor at the Hawkins School of Performing Arts in Folsom. Dance was part of her life from an early age, her father said.

Steffy was well known in the local dance community, including at The Torch Club, where her friends said she was a regular on Sundays and recognized for her dance moves.

Abigail Gibson, Steffy's friend, said she brought energy wherever she went and was passionate about dance, the people she taught and the community she built.

""She was just the life of the party everywhere she went,"" Gibson said. ""It was kind of impossible to be in a bad mood around her. She was always moving, always singing, always dancing.""

""Everything is still all in the works. This is all very sudden, but right now we're trying to contribute all community funds to further her legacy, especially in the arts, specifically with dance and children, kind of furthering the love that she loved to give to everyone,"" Weber said.

Weems said his hope is that his daughter left a lasting impression on the children she taught and that their futures reflect the impact she had on them.
