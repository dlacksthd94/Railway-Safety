A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 14 others.

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident that took place some 497 miles away as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said that of the 15 people affected in Tuesday’s crash, three were seriously injured. Five others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 11 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash.

While Spain’s high-speed rail network runs smoothly, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues, though accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, about 35 minutes from Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator Adif said the containment wall probably collapsed because of heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week.

More bodies discovered in Sunday derailment

Antonio Sanz, the regional health minister of Andalusia, where Sunday’s accident occurred, told Spanish media that the official toll had risen after another corpse was discovered in a severely damaged car.

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl survived the wreck without major injury, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people were treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Malaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” said Johnson, sitting in a wheelchair because of bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

Carriages came off tracks

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif.

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Farther along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

‘All hypotheses are open’

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident that Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence [of the derailment],” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.

At this time, “all hypotheses are open,” Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska said during a news conference. Accident investigators will analyze “the rails at the point where the derailment began and inspect the wheels” of the first train in a laboratory, he added.

The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train belonged to Spain’s public train company, Renfe.

Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and had passed a safety check on Jan. 15.

Puente and Renfe President Álvaro Fernández said that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 155 mph and “human error could be ruled out.”

The accident shook a nation that leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport.

“It is undoubtedly a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Puente told Spanish national radio RNE on Tuesday when asked about the damage to the reputation of the rail system.

Royals visit scene

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the scene of the accident, where they greeted emergency workers as well as some residents who had helped in the initial stages of the rescue. Afterward, they went to a hospital in Cordoba where many of the injured remain under care.

“We are all responsible for not looking away when the debris of a catastrophe is being cleared away,” Letizia told reporters after the visit.

Spain’s Civil Guard is collecting DNA samples from family members who fear they have loved ones among the unidentified dead.

High-speed trains resumed service Tuesday from Madrid to Sevilla and Malaga, the largest cities in Andalusia, Spain’s most populous region, but passengers had to travel a stretch of the journey by buses provided by the rail service. Puente said normal train service won’t resume until early February.

This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here .

A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 14 others.

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident that took place some 497 miles away as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said that of the 15 people affected in Tuesday’s crash, three were seriously injured. Five others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 11 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash.

While Spain’s high-speed rail network runs smoothly, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues, though accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, about 35 minutes from Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator Adif said the containment wall probably collapsed because of heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week.

Antonio Sanz, the regional health minister of Andalusia, where Sunday’s accident occurred, told Spanish media that the official toll had risen after another corpse was discovered in a severely damaged car.

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl survived the wreck without major injury, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people were treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Malaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” said Johnson, sitting in a wheelchair because of bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif.

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Farther along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident that Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence [of the derailment],” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.

At this time, “all hypotheses are open,” Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska said during a news conference. Accident investigators will analyze “the rails at the point where the derailment began and inspect the wheels” of the first train in a laboratory, he added.

The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train belonged to Spain’s public train company, Renfe.

Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and had passed a safety check on Jan. 15.

Puente and Renfe President Álvaro Fernández said that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 155 mph and “human error could be ruled out.”

The accident shook a nation that leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport.

“It is undoubtedly a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Puente told Spanish national radio RNE on Tuesday when asked about the damage to the reputation of the rail system.

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the scene of the accident, where they greeted emergency workers as well as some residents who had helped in the initial stages of the rescue. Afterward, they went to a hospital in Cordoba where many of the injured remain under care.

“We are all responsible for not looking away when the debris of a catastrophe is being cleared away,” Letizia told reporters after the visit.

Spain’s Civil Guard is collecting DNA samples from family members who fear they have loved ones among the unidentified dead.

High-speed trains resumed service Tuesday from Madrid to Sevilla and Malaga, the largest cities in Andalusia, Spain’s most populous region, but passengers had to travel a stretch of the journey by buses provided by the rail service. Puente said normal train service won’t resume until early February.

Spanish airline Iberia added more flights to southern cities until Sunday to help stranded travelers. Some bus companies also reinforced their services in the south.

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

The officer said that the girl had managed to escape from one of the train carriages most affected by the crash, La Vanguardia reported, adding that he did not notice her bare feet until about an hour after initially finding her. She told the officer that she had to take off her shoes before climbing through the broken window, because they had gotten caught between pieces of iron debris inside the carriage when it derailed, according to the newspaper.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.

""There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,"" Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.

Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 41 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.

Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, the town hall said. But The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.

Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.

Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.

""She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,"" the mayor said.","6-year-old girl is sole survivor of family killed in Spanish train wreck, found after escaping through broken window

Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, the town hall said. But The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.


""She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,"" the mayor said.","The roar was deafening inside the train car as it hurtled off the tracks, then slid down a steep slope, ripping open its frame. And then, amid the twisted metal of the wreckage, the cries of the injured and the silence of the dead.

Surrounded by bodies after the train accident in southern Spain, one little girl somehow emerged virtually unscathed.

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

The officer said that the girl had managed to escape from one of the train carriages most affected by the crash, La Vanguardia reported, adding that he did not notice her bare feet until about an hour after initially finding her. She told the officer that she had to take off her shoes before climbing through the broken window, because they had gotten caught between pieces of iron debris inside the carriage when it derailed, according to the newspaper.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.
