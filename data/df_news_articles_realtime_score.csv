A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 14 others.

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident that took place some 497 miles away as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said that of the 15 people affected in Tuesday’s crash, three were seriously injured. Five others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 11 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash.

While Spain’s high-speed rail network runs smoothly, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues, though accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, about 35 minutes from Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator Adif said the containment wall probably collapsed because of heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week.

More bodies discovered in Sunday derailment

Antonio Sanz, the regional health minister of Andalusia, where Sunday’s accident occurred, told Spanish media that the official toll had risen after another corpse was discovered in a severely damaged car.

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl survived the wreck without major injury, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people were treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Malaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” said Johnson, sitting in a wheelchair because of bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

Carriages came off tracks

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif.

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Farther along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

‘All hypotheses are open’

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident that Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence [of the derailment],” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.

At this time, “all hypotheses are open,” Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska said during a news conference. Accident investigators will analyze “the rails at the point where the derailment began and inspect the wheels” of the first train in a laboratory, he added.

The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train belonged to Spain’s public train company, Renfe.

Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and had passed a safety check on Jan. 15.

Puente and Renfe President Álvaro Fernández said that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 155 mph and “human error could be ruled out.”

The accident shook a nation that leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport.

“It is undoubtedly a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Puente told Spanish national radio RNE on Tuesday when asked about the damage to the reputation of the rail system.

Royals visit scene

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the scene of the accident, where they greeted emergency workers as well as some residents who had helped in the initial stages of the rescue. Afterward, they went to a hospital in Cordoba where many of the injured remain under care.

“We are all responsible for not looking away when the debris of a catastrophe is being cleared away,” Letizia told reporters after the visit.

Spain’s Civil Guard is collecting DNA samples from family members who fear they have loved ones among the unidentified dead.

High-speed trains resumed service Tuesday from Madrid to Sevilla and Malaga, the largest cities in Andalusia, Spain’s most populous region, but passengers had to travel a stretch of the journey by buses provided by the rail service. Puente said normal train service won’t resume until early February.

Spanish airline Iberia added more flights to southern cities until Sunday to help stranded travelers. Some bus companies also reinforced their services in the south.

And then, amid the twisted metal of the wreckage, the cries of the injured and the silence of the dead.

Surrounded by bodies after the train accident in southern Spain, one little girl somehow emerged virtually unscathed.

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

The officer said that the girl had managed to escape from one of the train carriages most affected by the crash, La Vanguardia reported, adding that he did not notice her bare feet until about an hour after initially finding her. She told the officer that she had to take off her shoes before climbing through the broken window, because they had gotten caught between pieces of iron debris inside the carriage when it derailed, according to the newspaper.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.

""There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,"" Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.

Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 41 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.

Sunday’s collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.

“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.

Here’s a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.

34 years

The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.

Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France.

The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.

Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.

3,900 kilometers

The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.

Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.

Spain’s commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.

Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.

7 vs. 2½ hours

The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.

On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.

Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.

The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.

Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.

Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.

“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.

“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”

The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change.

One crash

The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”

Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”

One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.

Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn’t designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.

Three companies

The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.

Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.

The first private company to get into Spain’s high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.

It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it’s working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.

The first private company to get into Spain’s high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.

It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it’s working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.

Spain’s high-speed train crash casts a shadow over a world-class rail system
BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.
Sunday’s collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.
“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.
Here’s a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.
34 years
The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.
Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France.
The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.
Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
3,900 kilometers
The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.
Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.
Spain’s commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.
Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.
7 vs. 2½ hours
The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.
On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.
Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.
The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.
Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.
Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.
“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.
“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”
The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change.
One crash
The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”
Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.
Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”
One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.
Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn’t designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.
Three companies

The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.

Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident, which took place about 500 miles away, as the nation began three days of mourning.

Emergency services in Catalonia said of the 37 people affected by Tuesday’s crash, five were seriously injured. Six others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 20 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash, and that the injured were taken to hospitals in the area. Regional firefighters said most of the injured had ridden in the first train car.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez acknowledged the Barcelona area crash, writing on X: “All my affection and solidarity with the victims and their families.”

While Spain’s high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, and at least until Sunday had been a source of confidence, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues. However, accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.

The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, located about 35 minutes outside Barcelona.

Spain’s railway operator ADIF said the containment wall most likely collapsed due to heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week. Commuter train service was canceled along the line, it said.

The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. (1:45 p.m. ET) when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Málaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif. Authorities were still recovering more bodies on Tuesday.

Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.

“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”

Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people had been treated and discharged.

Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Málaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

“It was probably two, three seconds. And everything was broken,” Jonsson, sitting in a wheelchair due to bruises on his ribs and back and dressed in part of a hospital gown, told reporters. “When we crashed, I didn’t know who was alive and who was dead.”

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl who survived the wreck was virtually unscathed, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

The mayor of their hometown called her survival a “miracle.”

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Further along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident, which Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

Amid the tragedy, it emerged that a 6-year-old girl who survived the wreck was virtually unscathed, while her parents, brother and cousin all perished.

The mayor of their hometown called her survival a “miracle.”

The front of the second train, which was carrying 184 people, took the brunt of the impact, which knocked its first two carriages off the track and down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of feet from the crash site, according to Andalusia regional President Juanma Moreno.

Associated Press images taken Tuesday showed the remains of the first two cars of the second train, severed from the rest of the train and lying beside the tracks. Train seats had been ejected onto the rocks that provide packing under the tracks.

Further along the tracks, Civil Guard officers inspected the interior of the first train with dogs as passengers’ belongings lay scattered on the floor, according to the video distributed by authorities. The last carriage was lying on its side on the tracks, and the second-to-last carriage was leaning to one side with all its windows shattered.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the accident, which Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente has called “truly strange” since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

Puente said officials had found a broken section of track that could possibly be related to the accident’s origin, while insisting that is just a hypothesis and that it could take weeks to reach any conclusions.

“Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),” Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.","BARCELONA, Spain — A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing at least one person and injuring 37 others.
The crash in Catalonia in northeastern Spain came just two days after a separate deadly train collision killed at least 42 people in the country’s south and injured dozens more.
Emergency workers Tuesday were still searching for more victims in the wreckage from Sunday’s deadly train accident, which took place about 500 miles away, as the nation began three days of mourning.
Emergency services in Catalonia said of the 37 people affected by Tuesday’s crash, five were seriously injured. Six others were in less serious condition. Emergency services said 20 ambulances had been sent to the site of the crash, and that the injured were taken to hospitals in the area. Regional firefighters said most of the injured had ridden in the first train car.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez acknowledged the Barcelona area crash, writing on X: “All my affection and solidarity with the victims and their families.”
While Spain’s high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, and at least until Sunday had been a source of confidence, the commuter rail service is plagued by reliability issues. However, accidents causing injury or death are not common in either.
The commuter train crashed near the town of Gelida, located about 35 minutes outside Barcelona.
Spain’s railway operator ADIF said the containment wall most likely collapsed due to heavy rainfall that swept across the northeastern Spanish region this week. Commuter train service was canceled along the line, it said.
The Sunday crash happened at 7:45 p.m. (1:45 p.m. ET) when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Málaga to the capital, Madrid, derailed and crashed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern city, according to rail operator Adif. Authorities were still recovering more bodies on Tuesday.
Fidel Sáez lost his mother in the wreck, but his two children, his brother and a nephew survived. Their trip to the capital to see the musical “The Lion King” turned into a nightmare on the way home.
“My brother has been taken off respirator. He told me that it was a miracle that he is alive. He had to get the children through a window,” Sáez told national TV broadcaster TVE. “He also asked me to tell the story of our mother, how good she was.”
Health authorities said 39 people remained in hospitals on Tuesday morning, while 83 people had been treated and discharged.
Among them was Emil Johnson, a Swedish citizen based in Málaga who was traveling to Madrid to renew his passport.

It comes as investigators are learning more about what might have caused the deadliest crash in the history of the country’s high-speed rail system.
What caused the disaster?
Investigators have found a broken joint in the tracks. It is a key failure point that may have triggered the disaster, according to a report from Reuters.
Reuters reports that a source briefed on the investigation said on-site technicians analyzing the rails identified some wear on the joint between sections of the rail which had “been there for some time.” They say that created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track.
Police say the three rear cars of one train, carrying roughly 300 passengers, jumped the tracks Sunday night and crossed onto the opposite line. It slammed into the front of an oncoming train carrying nearly 200 passengers, causing both trains to flip.
Spanish Transportation Minister Óscar Puente said investigators are trying to determine whether a break in a section of track was “the cause or the consequences” of the derailment, according to a New York Times report. He cautioned that at this time, any theories are just speculation because investigators were still working.
The president of Spain’s Railway Accident Investigation Commission, Íñigo Barrón, said in an interview with Spanish broadcaster RTVE that so far, it does not appear the crash was caused by human error or any problems with the signals.
“What always plays a part in a derailment is the interaction between the track and the vehicle, and that is what the commission is currently [looking into],” he said.
Worst crash in rail line’s history
Spain’s high-speed rail service is relatively young. It took off in 1992, ahead of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Regional authorities said Monday night that 41 people are still hospitalized, 12 of them in intensive care.

Authorities have set up tents to collect DNA samples from families as they work to identify victims and notify relatives. Search and rescue operations are still underway.

It comes as investigators are learning more about what might have caused the deadliest crash in the history of the country’s high-speed rail system.

Investigators have found a broken joint in the tracks. It is a key failure point that may have triggered the disaster, according to a report from Reuters.

Reuters reports that a source briefed on the investigation said on-site technicians analyzing the rails identified some wear on the joint between sections of the rail which had “been there for some time.” They say that created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track.

Police say the three rear cars of one train, carrying roughly 300 passengers, jumped the tracks Sunday night and crossed onto the opposite line. It slammed into the front of an oncoming train carrying nearly 200 passengers, causing both trains to flip.

Spanish Transportation Minister Óscar Puente said investigators are trying to determine whether a break in a section of track was “the cause or the consequences” of the derailment, according to a New York Times report. He cautioned that at this time, any theories are just speculation because investigators were still working.

The president of Spain’s Railway Accident Investigation Commission, Íñigo Barrón, said in an interview with Spanish broadcaster RTVE that so far, it does not appear the crash was caused by human error or any problems with the signals.

“What always plays a part in a derailment is the interaction between the track and the vehicle, and that is what the commission is currently [looking into],” he said.

Spain’s high-speed rail service is relatively young. It took off in 1992, ahead of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

This marks the first deadly crash in the high-speed rail line’s nearly 34-year history.

It is not, however, the worst train crash in Spanish history. In 2013, 80 people were killed when a non-high-speed train derailed.",,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.

Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village, located near the ill-fated rail line, said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.

“There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,” Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.

Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 41 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.

Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, officials said. But The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.

Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.

Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.

“She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,” the mayor said.","The roar was deafening inside the train car as it hurtled off the tracks, then slid down a steep slope, ripping open its frame.

Why it matters: That opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

Why now: Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

Full Story

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Flowers, signs and mementos are seen Monday at a makeshift memorial in the area where Alex Pretti was shot dead by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. On January 24, federal agents shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway. Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images )

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

The Los Angeles Metro Board voted to develop a 14-mile-long subway through the Santa Monica Mountains. It’s one of the first significant steps in what city and county leaders are describing as the region's most consequential transit project and perhaps one of the most important in the country.
The train: The transportation agency’s board approved a route for the train that could see as many as 124,000 rides between the Valley and Westside per day and reduce the total amount people would otherwise travel by car by nearly 800,000 miles a day.
Celebration tempered by words of caution: The historic vote to move the Sepulveda Transit Corridor forward didn’t happen without warnings about funding for the multi-billion dollar project and the need to keep communities engaged throughout the design process.
Read on … to hear more about the train that could one day take you off the 405 Freeway.
The Los Angeles Metro Board unanimously voted Thursday to proceed with developing a 14-mile-long subway under the Santa Monica Mountains. It’s one of the first significant steps in what city and county leaders are describing as the region's most consequential transit project and perhaps one of the most important in the country.
Metro staff said in a report to its board that it has secured funding through county tax measures for about 14% of the $24.2 billion it’s preliminarily estimated to cost to build the route, which will involve extensive tunneling. They added the cost estimate would be updated as further refinements are made, but having this amount of funding secured is “not uncommon” for projects early on in development.
Still, leaders underscored that while the need for a rail link between the Valley and Westside couldn’t be overstated, staff for the countywide transportation agency should remain mindful of financial constraints and push for cost reductions through the next several years before shovels hit the ground.
“Ambition matters, dreaming big matters, but honesty matters too,” L.A. City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky, who also is a member of the Metro Board, said during Thursday’s meeting. “We can't afford to approve transformative projects without being clear about the path to funding and delivery.”
The price tag certainly is “eye-popping” and Metro’s “largest project to date,” as Ray Sosa, the chief planning officer for the agency, recently wrote in an op-ed about the project.
With today’s vote progressing the project, the Metro Board enthusiastically endorsed the investment, for now, in theory.
The project and selected route
The Sepulveda Transit Corridor, as the project is known, was conceived to relieve Angelenos of the sometimes 90-minute drive between the Valley and Westside via the 405 Freeway, provide a crucial artery to connect with other regional rail and bus routes and link residential areas to job centers.
In June 2025, Metro released its draft environmental review of five different subway and monorail options. Of the more than 8,000 public comments Metro received, fewer than 70 expressed opposition to the project as a whole, according to agency staff.
Metro staff in January published its recommendation to move forward with further study of a modified version of one of the subway options.
That’s what the transportation agency’s board approved Thursday.
The route is projected to see as many as 124,000 rides per day and reduce the total amount people would otherwise travel by car by nearly 800,000 miles a day.
An end-to-end trip on the proposed route between Valley and the Westside is slated to take 20 minutes, with trains arriving every 2.5 minutes at peak times.
Station locations for the proposed train would connect to the Metro D, E and East San Fernando Valley rail lines, the Metrolink stop in Van Nuys and also the G bus rapid-transit line. Crucially, the route also will stop at UCLA, which over the years had become a non-negotiable necessity among students and other advocates of the train.
“Higher education deserves to be easily accessible for everyone,” Mariela Diaz, a UCLA commuter student who described herself as low income, said at the meeting Thursday. “Future UCLA students deserve to have their first on-campus station.”
As it’s currently planned, there wouldn’t be a stop providing direct access to the Getty Center, for which the museum had been publicly campaigning.
L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who has a seat on the Metro Board, asked Thursday that agency staff report back on “transportation alternatives to address fast and last-minute connections to the Getty Center.”
Report details economic benefits
A report from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation details how construction would generate as much as $40 billion in economic output and spur more than $16 billion in labor income countywide.
You can read the full report, commissioned by L.A. City Councilmember Nithya Raman’s office, here.
Leaders urge continued engagement and not to compromise on vision
Today’s vote directed Metro staff to focus on the proposed route for forthcoming technical and environmental analyses and clearances, as well as to further refine design and cost estimates.
There also will be continued community engagement.
Yaroslavsky amended the item the board approved Thursday to include language asking Metro staff to, among other tasks, report back on a community engagement plan focused on the communities that might be impacted by tunneling or construction and to maintain a publicly accessible outreach calendar.
Metro’s final environmental documents, which will be the culmination of the continued engagement and study, will be subject to future approval from the board.
When construction starts, the focus will first be on the middle segment of the train running from the G-line stop in Van Nuys to the future D-line stop in Westwood.
The additional segments on the north and south sides of the route would be built afterward.

Big Bear’s famous bald eagle couple, Jackie and Shadow, now have a pair of eggs to look after.
Why now: Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.
Why it matters: More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie laid the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.

Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.
More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie welcomed the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.
The season so far
Jackie laid the first egg around 4:30 p.m. Friday, with Shadow stopping by to see it for the first time about 10 minutes later, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley records.
Jackie tends to lay eggs three days apart, and the second egg arrived right on schedule.
Jackie could be seen rousing and puffing up her feathers about a half-hour before laying the second egg. She made a high-pitched whistling tea kettle noise a little before 5 p.m. Monday.
Officials from Friends of Big Bear Valley have told LAist those behaviors are signs an egg is imminent.
“She looks almost royal, because all of her feathers are out and it's just — I cry,” Jenny Voisard, the organization’s media and website manager, said with a laugh last week. “It's usually pretty amazing.”
The eagle pair typically takes turns caring for their eggs. Shadow visited the nest for nearly three hours across nine incubation “daddy duty” sessions on Sunday, according to organization records.
What’s ahead for the nest
Jackie has laid up to three eggs in a clutch, including in each of the past two seasons, so fans could see another egg arrive this week.
A clutch refers to the group of eggs laid in each nesting attempt. Bald eagles generally have one clutch per season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. A second clutch is possible if the eggs don’t make it through the early incubation process.
For example, Jackie laid a second clutch in February 2021 after the first round of eggs was broken or destroyed by ravens the month before.
The Big Bear eagles also practice delayed incubation, which is when Jackie and Shadow don’t apply their full body heat to the eggs until the whole clutch is laid.
Waiting to incubate full time helps the eggs hatch closer together, making the chicks more similar in size and age, which the organization says gives them a better chance of survival.
Jackie and Shadow successfully delayed incubation for their trio of eggs last season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. Sunny and Gizmohatched and later went on to fledge, or fly away from the nest for the first time, last summer.
Chicks? Chicks soon??
Once egg-laying is over, the chick countdown is on.
Jackie and Shadow's usual incubation time is around 35 to 39 days, starting when the eagles begin to fully incubate their clutch, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley.
Last season, the first egg hatched at around 40 days old, the second egg hatched around 38 days old and the third egg around 39 days old.
“Pip Watch” — short for pipping, which is the first hole an eaglet makes as it emerges from its egg — is typically announced by Friends of Big Bear Valley before chicks break through each season.
Last year’s Pip Watch kicked off in March, a few days before the first chick hatched in the nest.

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights announced a new lawsuit Monday against federal immigration agencies for claims detainees at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center lack basic necessities and medical care.
Who is involved: Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
What they want to change: ”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
A history of issues: In court documents, CHIRLA pointed to reports by government and nonprofit agencies that showed problems in previous years, including a DHS Office of Inspector General report from 2018 that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights announced a new lawsuit Monday against federal immigration agencies for claims of inhumane conditions at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County.
The organization claims people detained in the Adelanto facility lack drinkable water, healthy food, clean clothes, places to sleep and access to medical care. Failing to provide these basic necessities, CHIRLA says in court documents, amounts to punishment — violating detainees rights to due process.
“ We are really at a moment where we are seeing a human rights crisis right before our eyes,” CHIRLA policy director Jeanette Zanipatin said at a news conference Monday. “And the detention centers, especially the one at Adelanto, is where we are seeing it unfold in real time.”
Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
ICE and Homeland Security have not responded to LAist about the case or claims in this article.
A question of constitutional rights
When CHIRLA announced the lawsuit on Monday, Zanipatin said there has been “a long history of unsafe and abusive conditions” at the Adelanto facility. She referenced a July 2025 report from the nonprofit Disability Rights California that found conditions at the facility were “dangerous and inadequate for all people, especially for those with disabilities.”
Court documents filed by CHIRLA also reference previous reports that found issues at the facility, including a 2018 report from the DHS Office of Inspector General that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”
Those issues included findings of nooses in detainees’ cells, improper use of disciplinary segregation and inadequate medical care.
“Based on interviews with detainees and medical staff and a review of independent reports,” the report states, “we concluded that detainees do not have timely access to proper medical care.”
CHIRLA claims in their lawsuit that Adelanto leadership rejected the findings of the inspector general report and took no corrective action.
The concerns raised by CHIRLA as they announced the lawsuit closely resemble the findings of Disability Rights California, which also claimed detainees were not provided adequate medical care, food, water or clean clothing. The organization also reported that some people had limited access to communication with their loved ones.
Huerta claimed that the conditions in the Adelanto facility are poor by design.
“ Adelanto, like most ICE prisons, is engineered to be so punishing, so relentlessly soul crushing, that people abandon their rights and accept deportation even when they have strong asylum claims or a clear pathway to legal status,” Huerta said.
He said 32 people died while detained by ICE nationwide in 2025, and at least 6 more have died in January. Two people died at Adelanto last fall, Huerta said.
Family members speak out
Mariel Garcia told LAist she would call her father, Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, nearly every day. That ended when he was detained by immigration agents in Costa Mesa on Oct. 14.
Garcia-Aviles had a work permit, his daughter said, but he was detained and taken to Adelanto. She said she tried many times to ask the facility staff to allow her to call her father, or even to get an update on his condition, but she was never able to talk to him again.
Worried, she said she got a call from the staff at Adelanto.
“ They called me the day he was passing away,” Garcia told LAist, “They're like, go tell your family and friends to come and say their last goodbyes because your father's in critical condition.”
Her brother, Gabriel Garcia, said that when they arrived at the hospital their father was intubated and “lifeless."" Still, he said, there were law enforcement officers standing outside the hospital room.
Garcia-Aviles died Oct. 23 at age 56.
Jose Ayala also talked about the loss of his brother, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, while he was detained in the Adelanto facility.
“ He was there for about a month and we knew nothing of his condition,” Ayala said at Monday’s press conference, “just that he was sick and that he wasn't getting any help when he asked.”
Ayala said his family learned of his brother’s death when the police came and knocked at their door. He said staff at Adelanto did not tell them Ayala-Uribe had been hospitalized or that he needed a surgery, which ICE said in a news release was for an abscess.
Ayala told LAist that he was able to talk with his brother over the phone a couple of times when he was detained, and Ayala-Uribe was joking with him about the poor conditions of the facility causing him to lose weight.
“ One of the last things he told me,” Ayala recalled, “was, ‘We'll see who comes out skinnier.’”
He said his brother was 39 when he died on Sept. 22, 2025.
CHIRLA alleges in court documents that staff at Adelanto were aware Ayala-Uribe was having a potentially life-threatening medical emergency three days before his death, but he was taken back to his cell after being seen by the facility’s medical team.
An ICE news release said Ayala-Uribe “was evaluated by an on-call medical provider Sept. 18, provided medication, and returned to his dormitory,” but did not mention the severity of his condition.
The cause of both deaths remain under investigation, CHIRLA said in an accompanying news release.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.
Why now: Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.
Why it matters: That opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.
Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.
But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.
""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""
Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.
Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.
At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.
That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.
""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.
After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.
Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown
The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.
Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.
The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.
""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""
Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.
A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.
""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""
Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2.

Topline:
Ex-Olympian Ryan Wedding appeared in court Monday in Santa Ana where he pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing him of running a billion-dollar drug trafficking ring and orchestrating multiple killings.
Why now: Wedding was taken into custody last week in Mexico City. Mexican officials say he turned himself in at the U.S. Embassy there, according to the Associated Press. But the AP also reported Wedding's lawyer said Monday that he actually did not surrender to law enforcement, but had been living in Mexico and was arrested.
The backstory: Wedding is accused of moving as much as 60 tons of cocaine between various locations in South and North America, and that he used Los Angeles as his primary point of distribution. The charges also tie him to the 2023 killing of two members of a Canadian family as retaliation for a stolen drug shipment, a 2024 killing over a drug debt and the killing of a witness in Colombia who was set to testify against him. Wedding was an Olympic snowboarder with Team Canada during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. He appeared in just one event, the men's parallel giant slalom, where he finished 24th. Last March, Wedding was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list.
What's next: Wedding's trail has tentatively been scheduled to start on March 24.","The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" 
Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""
Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

Why it matters: That opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

Why now: Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

The crash took place near Adamuz in the southern Andalusia region late Sunday night, when a high-speed train operated by private rail company Iryo, going to Madrid from Malaga, derailed, straying into the path of an oncoming train operated by Spain's public Renfe network, which also derailed.

The cause of the crash remains a mystery, though investigators say they will focus on coach six of the Iryo train, which they believe was the first to derail. The Guardia Civil national police force asked for that carriage to be left where it came to a rest so it can be examined.

Rail experts ""extremely surprised"" by crash on straight track

""There are many pieces of the puzzle we must fit together,"" Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente told the country's Onda Cero radio network Tuesday.

Puente called the crash ""extremely strange"" on Monday because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May, adding that ""all the railway experts are extremely surprised.""

""Nothing seems to suggest anything was wrong with it,"" he said Tuesday. ""Three trains passed 20 minutes before ... ""When I say that the accident is strange, it couldn't be stranger.""

Investigators studying the scene of the accident found a broken joint on the rails, which likely created a gap that widened as trains passed over it, the Reuters news agency said Tuesday, citing a source briefed on the initial investigation. The faulty joint could prove key to determining the cause of the accident, the source said.

Puente, however, warned against drawing any conclusions based on ""mere speculation.""

""When the train went off the rails, it produced a ton of fractures in the track, for about 200 meters [yards]. And so for the first fracture in the track, the key is to determine — and currently no expert can say for certain — if this fracture was a cause or a consequence,"" he told Onda Cero.

""That is the crux of this whole thing, or one of them, knowing what came first — the fracturing of the track and then the derailment, or if the derailment caused the fracture in the track,"" Puente said, adding that if there was an issue with the track before the crash, investigators would still ""have to find out why.""

Spain's chief high-speed train engineer Álvaro Aznar told CBS News on Monday that the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash, but authorities have stressed that it could take weeks, if not longer, to know for sure.

Officials have ruled out sabotage and human error, saying both trains were travelling under the speed limit for the section of track.

""The possibility of sabotage was never considered,"" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a press conference following a weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""There has never been any element suggesting otherwise.""

Spain's worst train accident in recent times occurred in 2013 when 80 people died after a train derailed in the northwest of the country. Investigators found that the train was traveling 111 mph in a 50 mph zone when it left the tracks.

Death toll could still climb as recovery work continues

Local residents were among the first on the scene of the crash Sunday night.

""There were people with missing limbs,"" said Gonzalo Sanchez, who shuttled survivors to safety on his four-wheeler. ""They were crying. Nobody was born to see this.""

""I think we did all we could,"" another Adamuz resident, who identified himself only as Antonio, told the El Pais newspaper. ""The sad thing is we couldn't do more.""

The death toll from the accident climbed to 41 on Monday evening after the body of another passenger was found in one of the Iryo train carriages, according to the the regional government.

More than 120 people were injured and 39, including four children, were still hospitalized on Tuesday as the nation began three days of mourning.

Across the country, public buildings flew flags at half-mast, while television anchors wore black, and cabinet ministers cut back public appearances.

Rescue crews began using heavy machinery to lift some of the worst damaged train coaches off the damaged section of track on Monday, to give better access to the site.

Juan Manuel Moreno, the head of the Andalusia region's government, said Monday that it would take another 24-48 hours ""to know with certainty how many deaths have resulted from this terrible accident.""

Around 35 families were still desperately waiting for news of missing loved ones on Monday, Fran Vicente, a Red Cross psychologist, told El Pais, saying: ""What they're suffering is brutal.""

The crash took place near Adamuz in the southern Andalusia region late Sunday night, when a high-speed train operated by private rail company Iryo, going to Madrid from Malaga, derailed, straying into the path of an oncoming train operated by Spain's public Renfe network, which also derailed.

The cause of the crash remains a mystery, though investigators say they will focus on coach six of the Iryo train, which they believe was the first to derail. The Guardia Civil national police force asked for that carriage to be left where it came to a rest so it can be examined.

""There are many pieces of the puzzle we must fit together,"" Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente told the country's Onda Cero radio network Tuesday.

Puente called the crash ""extremely strange"" on Monday because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May, adding that ""all the railway experts are extremely surprised.""

""Nothing seems to suggest anything was wrong with it,"" he said Tuesday. ""Three trains passed 20 minutes before ... ""When I say that the accident is strange, it couldn't be stranger.""

Investigators studying the scene of the accident found a broken joint on the rails, which likely created a gap that widened as trains passed over it, the Reuters news agency said Tuesday, citing a source briefed on the initial investigation. The faulty joint could prove key to determining the cause of the accident, the source said.

Puente, however, warned against drawing any conclusions based on ""mere speculation.""

""When the train went off the rails, it produced a ton of fractures in the track, for about 200 meters [yards]. And so for the first fracture in the track, the key is to determine — and currently no expert can say for certain — if this fracture was a cause or a consequence,"" he told Onda Cero.

""That is the crux of this whole thing, or one of them, knowing what came first — the fracturing of the track and then the derailment, or if the derailment caused the fracture in the track,"" Puente said, adding that if there was an issue with the track before the crash, investigators would still ""have to find out why.""

Spain's chief high-speed train engineer Álvaro Aznar told CBS News on Monday that the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash, but authorities have stressed that it could take weeks, if not longer, to know for sure.

Officials have ruled out sabotage and human error, saying both trains were travelling under the speed limit for the section of track.

""The possibility of sabotage was never considered,"" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a press conference following a weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""There has never been any element suggesting otherwise.""

Spain's worst train accident in recent times occurred in 2013 when 80 people died after a train derailed in the northwest of the country. Investigators found that the train was traveling 111 mph in a 50 mph zone when it left the tracks.

Death toll could still climb as recovery work continues

Local residents were among the first on the scene of the crash Sunday night.

""There were people with missing limbs,"" said Gonzalo Sanchez, who shuttled survivors to safety on his four-wheeler. ""They were crying. Nobody was born to see this.""

""I think we did all we could,"" another Adamuz resident, who identified himself only as Antonio, told the El Pais newspaper. ""The sad thing is we couldn't do more.""



The death toll from the accident climbed to 41 on Monday evening after the body of another passenger was found in one of the Iryo train carriages, according to the the regional government.

More than 120 people were injured and 39, including four children, were still hospitalized on Tuesday as the nation began three days of mourning.

Across the country, public buildings flew flags at half-mast, while television anchors wore black, and cabinet ministers cut back public appearances.

Rescue crews began using heavy machinery to lift some of the worst damaged train coaches off the damaged section of track on Monday, to give better access to the site.

Juan Manuel Moreno, the head of the Andalusia region's government, said Monday that it would take another 24-48 hours ""to know with certainty how many deaths have resulted from this terrible accident.""

Around 35 families were still desperately waiting for news of missing loved ones on Monday, Fran Vicente, a Red Cross psychologist, told El Pais, saying: ""What they're suffering is brutal.""

Four of the people hurt were seriously injured, a spokesperson for the fire service in the northeastern region of Catalonia, Claudi Gallardo, told reporters.

Tuesday's train crash occurred about 35 minutes outside of Barcelona. Spain's railway operator, ADIF, said the containment wall likely collapsed as a result of heavy rainfall that hit northeastern Spain this week, AP reported.

Juanma Moreno, the president of Andalusia, the southern Spanish region where the accident happened, confirmed the new death toll in an afternoon press conference. Efforts to recover the bodies from the two wrecked train cars continued, he added.

The impact tossed the second train's lead carriages off the track, sending them plummeting down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno said earlier in the day, describing the wreckage as a ""mass of twisted metal"" with bodies likely still to be found inside. Some passengers were catapulted through windows and their bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno previously said.

The crash occurred Sunday at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.

The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said, adding that it appeared the largest number of the deaths occurred in those carriages.

Authorities said all the survivors had been rescued in the early morning.

Moreno said Monday morning that emergency services were still searching what he described as a mass of twisted metal where the smashed carriages had derailed.

""It is likely (that there will be more dead people found) when you look at the mass of metal that is there. The firefighters have done a great job, but unfortunately when they get the heavy machinery to lift the carriages it is probable we will find more victims.""

""Here at ground zero, when you look at this mass of twisted iron, you see the violence of the impact.""

Video and photos showed twisted train cars lying on their sides under floodlights. Passengers reported climbing out of smashed windows, with some using emergency hammers to break the windows, according to Salvador Jiménez, a journalist for Spanish broadcaster RTVE, who was on board one of the derailed trains.

He told the network by phone Sunday that ""there was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed.""

Spanish police said 159 people were injured. Andalusia's regional emergency services said 41 people remained hospitalized on Monday, 12 of whom were in intensive care units. Another 81 passengers were discharged by late Monday afternoon, authorities said.

The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about about 230 miles south of Madrid.

In Adamuz, a sports center was turned into a makeshift hospital and the Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. Members of Spain's civil guard and civil defense worked on site throughout the night.

Spain's chief high-speed train engineer, Álvaro Aznar, told CBS News the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash.

Puente called the crash ""a truly strange"" incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the private company Iryo while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, was part of Spain's public train company Renfe.

When asked by reporters how long an inquiry into the crash's cause could take, he said it could be a month.

Spain has the largest high-speed rail network in Europe for trains moving over 155 mph, with more than 1,900 miles of track, according to the European Union.

The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024.

Train services between Madrid and cities in Andalusia were canceled for Monday.

King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain said Sunday they were ""following with great concern the serious accident between two high-speed trains in Adamuz.""

Spanish police said 159 people were injured. Andalusia's regional emergency services said 41 people remained hospitalized on Monday, 12 of whom were in intensive care units. Another 81 passengers were discharged by late Monday afternoon, authorities said.

The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about about 230 miles south of Madrid.

In Adamuz, a sports center was turned into a makeshift hospital and the Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. Members of Spain's civil guard and civil defense worked on site throughout the night.

Spain's chief high-speed train engineer, Álvaro Aznar, told CBS News the ""earliest signs point to mechanical failure"" as the cause of the crash.

Puente called the crash ""a truly strange"" incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the private company Iryo while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, was part of Spain's public train company Renfe.

When asked by reporters how long an inquiry into the crash's cause could take, he said it could be a month.

Spain has the largest high-speed rail network in Europe for trains moving over 155 mph, with more than 1,900 miles of track, according to the European Union.

The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024.

Train services between Madrid and cities in Andalusia were canceled for Monday.

King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain said Sunday they were ""following with great concern the serious accident between two high-speed trains in Adamuz.""

""We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,"" the royal palace said on X.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X that she was following ""the terrible news"" from Cordoba.

""Tonight you are in my thoughts,"" she wrote in Spanish.

Spain's worst train accident this century occurred in 2013 when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country's northwest. An investigation concluded the train was traveling 111 mph on a stretch with a 50 mph speed limit when it left the tracks.",,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

A bystander was killed after being struck by a Tesla that crashed at a light rail station in Folsom, officials said Thursday.
Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) stated that, shortly before 3 p.m., a Tesla struck an ADA access ramp at Iron Point Station near the Folsom Premium Outlet before flipping over and landing on the tracks along Folsom Boulevard.
The Folsom Fire Department said the car went off the roadway, struck the station platform, and hit a bystander who was waiting for a train. That bystander was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said.
The driver of the Tesla was able to exit the vehicle on her own and she was transported to UC Davis Medical Center in an unknown condition.
According to the Sacramento County Coroner's Office, the bystander who died was a 22-year-old woman.
As a result of the crash, SacRT implemented a bus bridge between Sunrise and Historic Folsom stations while crews worked to clear the scene and inspect the tracks for damage. That bus bridge ended and normal light rail operations resumed around 8 p.m.
No additional information about what led to the crash has been released. The incident remains under investigation.","A bystander was killed after being struck by a Tesla that crashed at a light rail station in Folsom, officials said Thursday.Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) stated that, shortly before 3 p.m., a Tesla struck an ADA access ramp at Iron Point Station near the Folsom Premium Outlet before flipping over and landing on the tracks along Folsom Boulevard.The Folsom Fire Department said the car went off the roadway, struck the station platform, and hit a bystander who was waiting for a train.

Visiting Las Vegas, Nevada, is a regular occurrence for many Southern California residents. Whether it's a road trip to experience some of the more family-friendly attractions or a long weekend for a bachelor/bachelorette party, few are strangers to Sin City. The only drag is the (typically) four-hour drive it takes to get there if you're venturing from the Los Angeles area. Flying is easily the quickest mode of transportation, with a typical flight not taking much longer than an hour, but getting through airport traffic, TSA, and waiting to take off, you might as well drive.

You could take a train, but a five-hour train ride is worse than four hours in a car. With no high-speed rail to speak of, those are the only options. However, for six years, Brightline West has been working to make a high-speed train from L.A., California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, a reality, and now there's an end date in sight. It won't be complete until late 2029, which is worse than the original 2028 projection, but to have a train that can travel 200 mph — significantly faster than any Amtrak trains – and get passengers to Sin City in roughly two hours, it will be a welcome wait.

Brightline West's all-electric train will travel on a 218-mile track that will connect to Metrolink's system that traverses the downtown Los Angeles area, but the flagship station will be in Las Vegas. There will be additional stations in Apple Valley, Hesperia, and Rancho Cucamonga.

The history of this high-speed rail

Brightline is a well-known company name around Central and South Florida, as its trains run daily from Miami to Orlando. In 2018, it bought the company Express West, opening up a pathway for Brightline to make its debut on the West Coast. California approved a rail line that would travel from Victorville, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2020, which Brightline West would oversee. Unfortunately, Covid-19 forced the company to push construction back to 2022, pushing the U.S. further behind the rest of the world in high-speed rail.

Then, in 2023, the Federal Department of Transportation decided to help get the ball rolling and awarded $3 billion to Brightline West. Former President Joe Biden even visited the site where the flagship station in Vegas will be to say, ""It's on track to be completed by the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles,"" per Fox5 Las Vegas on YouTube.

Brightline West finally broke ground in 2024 and spent 2025 conducting field work to prepare maintenance facilities, as well as the median along Interstate 15, where the rail will be positioned. As of 2026, the parking structure for the Vegas station is well underway, with a good chunk of it completed. Once the company finally has the median of the I-15 and the land around it prepared, it will be able to place the rail.

A man was killed after he fell off a subway platform in Philadelphia and was hit by a train early Wednesday morning, police said.
The Philadelphia Police Department said Terrell Burton, 41, died after he was hit by a train at the SEPTA Broad Street Line Hunting Park Station around 1:30 a.m.
SEPTA said surveillance video caught Burton entering the station around 12:30 a.m. The transit authority said he fell onto the southbound tracks about an hour later and was struck by a work train, not a passenger subway.
PPD originally said Burton was struck after he got off an arriving subway, but SEPTA clarified it was a maintenance train that hit him since Broad Street Line service ends at 12:30 a.m.
Police said the city's fire department responded to the accident and pronounced Burton dead at 2:03 a.m.
The accident remains under investigation by the police department's crash investigation division.","A man was killed after he fell off a subway platform in Philadelphia and was hit by a train early Wednesday morning, police said.The Philadelphia Police Department said Terrell Burton, 41, died after he was hit by a train at the SEPTA Broad Street Line Hunting Park Station around 1:30 a.m.SEPTA said surveillance video caught Burton entering the station around 12:30 a.m. The transit authority said he fell onto the southbound tracks about an hour later and was struck by a work train, not a passenger subway.PPD originally said Burton was struck after he got off an arriving subway, but SEPTA clarified it was a maintenance train that hit him since Broad Street Line service ends at 12:30 a.m.Police said the city's fire department responded to the accident and pronounced Burton dead at 2:03 a.m.

Sunday's collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.
“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.
Here's a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.
34 years
The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.
Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France.
The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.
Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
3,900 kilometers
The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.
Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.
Spain's commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.
Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.
7 vs. 2½ hours
The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.
On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.
Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.
The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.
Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.
Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.
“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.
“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”
The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change.
One crash
The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”
Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.
Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”
One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.
Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn't designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.
Three companies
The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.
Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.
The first private company to get into Spain's high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.
It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it's working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.
This story has been corrected to show that Ouigo was the first private company to operate a high-speed train, not Iryo.","BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.Sunday's collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.

The official death toll from Sunday’s accident rose to 41 by late Monday, the head of Andalucia's regional government, Juan Manuel Moreno, said.

But officials warned that that count may not be definitive, with emergency workers still probing for bodies among what Moreno called ""a twisted mass of metal.""

Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Spanish national television RTVE late on Monday that search teams believe they have found three more bodies still trapped in the wreckage. Those bodies are not included in the official count, the minister said.

The crash happened at 7:45 pm on Sunday when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails.

It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.

The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a 4-metre slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of metres from the crash site, Moreno said.

Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the incident that Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente has called ""strange"" since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.

But Puente said late on Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.

""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the accident site near the town of Adamuz on Monday, where he declared three days of mourning with flags lowered on all public buildings and navy vessels.

Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia are scheduled to visit the scene later on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Spain's Civil Guard is collecting DNA samples from family members who fear they have loved ones among the unidentified dead.

Sole survivor

Meanwhile, a six-year-old girl is the only survivor from her family after the deaths of her parents, brother and a cousin in Sunday’s rail disaster.

The Zamorano Álvarez family, originally from Punta Umbría and now living in Aljaraque, were returning home after spending the weekend in Madrid, where they had attended a football match.

The crash happened at 7:45 pm on Sunday when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails.
It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.
The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a 4-metre slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of metres from the crash site, Moreno said.
Officials are continuing to investigate the causes of the incident that Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente has called ""strange"" since it occurred on a straight line and neither train was speeding.
But Puente said late on Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.
""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio Cadena Ser.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the accident site near the town of Adamuz on Monday, where he declared three days of mourning with flags lowered on all public buildings and navy vessels.
Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia are scheduled to visit the scene later on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Spain's Civil Guard is collecting DNA samples from family members who fear they have loved ones among the unidentified dead.

When a Fatal Accident Changes Life Forever

Losing a loved one in a sudden crash is devastating. The grief can feel overwhelming, and for many families, that emotional pain is compounded by unexpected financial pressures—medical bills, funeral expenses, and the loss of income or support your loved one once provided.

In moments like these, it’s important to know that you are not alone. A wrongful death claim can help families find a sense of justice and financial stability after an unimaginable loss. While no legal action can ever replace the person you’ve lost, it can provide accountability and help protect your family’s future.

Wrongful death claims can help families recover compensation for:

Funeral and burial expenses

Medical costs related to final care

Lost income and future financial support

Loss of companionship and emotional suffering

Beyond financial relief, pursuing a claim is often about accountability. Whether a crash was caused by distracted driving, speeding, or another form of negligence, holding the responsible party accountable can help bring closure and reduce the risk of similar tragedies happening to others.

At Sweet Lawyers, we understand how overwhelming this time can be. Our experienced wrongful death and personal injury attorneys have spent decades supporting families through some of life’s most difficult moments. We approach every case with care, respect, and a deep commitment to justice.

“One Battle After Another” has been the favorite since the season’s first poll, lo those many months ago. Bolstered by its long string of critics’ group wins, it’s now a consensus pick, one of many in Round 3. “Hamnet” and “Sinners” have been in the second and third positions that whole time, with the rest of the field vacillating wildly behind them. “Marty Supreme” has to be the hottest contender, with “Frankenstein” and “Train Dreams” confidently taking up favored positions. Among international contenders, “The Secret Agent’s” momentum culminated in foreign-language film wins at LAFCA, CCA and the reconstituted Globes. However …

It’s our perennial duty to point out that the critics’ groups have virtually no overlap with the academy. The Globes have been particularly poor at matching the eventual best -picture winner, scoring just under 50% over the last 35 years in that regard. So take “Battle’s” one-win-after-another season so far with a grain of salt.

Still, the drama for the panelists seems to be about which less-ballyhooed contenders might squeak out noms: “For a surprise pick, I’d edge toward ‘Blue Moon’ sneaking in,” says Robert Daniels. “I’m thinking we could see three foreign-language entries here for the first time ever,” opines Dave Karger. And Katie Walsh writes, “Taking a little bit of a swing here, and subbing in Spain’s Oscar entry ‘Sirāt’ for ‘Avatar.’”

When this awards season started, who would have pegged neither the “Avatar” nor the “Wicked” sequel to make the projected nominees list?

Elizabeth Taylor was born in London to a prominent American couple, grew up in Los Angeles, became a film star at an early age and eventually married U.S. Sen. John Warner, among others.
It was about 70 years ago that Hudson and Taylor, along with other actors, converged on a small town in Albemarle County to film the movie “Giant,” based on a novel that was published in 1952.
The movie opens with a bucolic scene of horses roaming through the countryside as a train, with Hudson on board, arrives at the station in Keswick, located just a few miles east of Charlottesville. The old station in rural Albemarle County was standing in for Ardmore, an unincorporated part of Prince George’s County, Maryland, that was part of the novel.
“The majestic, rolling green-hilled pastures of the area (with white picket fences) were lovingly viewed as his train pulled into the station at Ardmore,” according to filmsite.org of the movie, which also starred James Dean.
Jordan “Bick” Benedict Jr. (Hudson), after being picked up at the station, is the passenger in a car when he spots socialite Leslie Lynnton (Taylor) riding one of the horses through the countryside. He is smitten (for Taylor, and maybe the horse, who knows) and turns out the driver of the car is the father of Taylor’s character.
“That sure is a beautiful animal,” says Hudson.
The building in Keswick is no longer a train station, but has been used in the past as a school. It closed as a train station in 1967, according to piedmontsub.com.
The plot of the movie is that Hudson’s character is a rich farmer in Texas who comes to Maryland to buy a prized horse – and he meets the Taylor character on the trip. They marry, move back to a large ranch in Texas, where minority workers are not treated well and all kinds of drama ensues.
The movie was released on Oct. 10, 1956, in New York City. (On the same day, the New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in Brooklyn in the seventh and deciding game of the World Series.)
The film, in 2005, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally historically or aesthetically significant.”
The other huge star in the movie was Indiana native Dean (the “Rebel Without a Cause” star), who died in a car accident at the age of 24 in California just a few months after filming and prior to the release of “Giant.” Another star was Dennis Hopper, who was also a filmmaker and photographer.
One of the minor actors was Jane Withers, who was born in Atlanta nearly 100 years ago – on April 12, 1926. She passed in 2021, while New York City native Sal Mineo, who also appeared in “Giant,” died about 50 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1976.
Amazingly, some of the less-known actors in the film are still alive, according to Wikipedia: Carroll Baker, 94, who was born in 1931 in Johnstown, Pa., and Elsa Cardenas, 93, who was born in Mexico.
“Carroll Baker was born into a Catholic family, the daughter of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, a traveling salesman,” according to mabumbe.com. “Of Irish and Polish descent, Baker faced early challenges when her parents separated when she was eight years old, leading her, her mother, and younger sister to relocate to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Despite financial hardships, Baker was active in her school’s debate team, marching band, and musicals during her time at Greensburg Salem High School. At 18, the family moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she attended St. Petersburg Junior College. Her early experiences as a magician’s assistant and professional dancer laid the foundation for her future in the performing arts.”
Soon after, she moved to New York City to launch her career.
The movie is noted, by some sources, as having several gay actors, including Hudson, though that was not common knowledge during the 1950s. Hudson was born Nov. 17, 1925 and died in 1985. Taylor, married to Warner from 1976-82, passed in Los Angeles in 2011 at the age of 79.","Photo: © Romolo Tavani/stock.adobe.com

On January 26, 2005, Southern California’s morning commute was shattered when a Metrolink passenger train struck a vehicle left on the tracks near Chevy Chase Drive on the Glendale–Los Angeles boundary. The collision set off a chain of derailments and secondary impacts involving three trains, leaving 11 people dead and roughly 180 others injured, one of the region’s most devastating commuter-rail tragedies.
The southbound Metrolink train involved was Ventura County Line train #100, operating in push-pull service with a cab car leading. A Jeep Cherokee had been driven onto the railroad right of way and abandoned on the track a short distance beyond the grade crossing, and the train hit it at around the start of the rush hour. Investigators later treated the vehicle’s placement on the track as a criminal act, and the driver survived.
The impact did not end at the point of collision. Debris from the vehicle and the forces involved contributed to Metrolink #100 derailing, and the derailed consist then struck an unoccupied Union Pacific gravel/work train that had been left standing on a siding nearby. The sequence continued as the Metrolink train jackknifed and collided with passing Metrolink train #901 traveling in the opposite direction, derailing equipment across multiple tracks.
Witness accounts and official summaries described a chaotic scene in darkness and early light, with wrecked cars, twisted metal, and a fire burning near the front of the commuter consist. Passengers were forced to find their way out through damaged cars while emergency calls poured in. Some of the first help came from workers at the nearby Costco, who climbed the perimeter fence, brought fire extinguishers, and assisted victims before the full emergency response was in place.
The response quickly expanded into a major multi-agency operation, with large numbers of fire and medical units converging from surrounding jurisdictions. Helicopters were used as part of the response, and investigators and rescuers worked the site as both an accident scene and a crime scene. The scale of the casualties and the complexity of three derailed trains made the work of searching, triage, and recovery both urgent and prolonged.
In the months and years that followed, the crash became inseparable from the criminal case against Juan Manuel Álvarez, who was accused of leaving the Jeep on the track. In 2008, he was convicted of 11 counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances and one count of arson, and he was sentenced to 11 consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Each January 26, the date endures as a grim marker for commuters and rail workers alike: a reminder of how a single act on the tracks can ripple outward into irreversible loss.","On January 26, 2005, Southern California’s morning commute was shattered when a Metrolink passenger train struck a vehicle left on the tracks near Chevy Chase Drive on the Glendale–Los Angeles boundary.

The circumstances leading up to the collision were not immediately released, and the incident remains under investigation.

SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities.

CRASH INVESTIGATION NEEDED

Each year, hundreds of lives are lost in train-related incidents across the United States, many occurring at crossings with limited warning signs, faulty signals, or inadequate fencing. According to the National Safety Council, railroad fatalities reached 954 in 2024, reflecting a 1% decrease from the revised 2023 total of 967.

Candice Bond, a seasoned train accident attorney, emphasized the importance of conducting an independent investigation promptly following a fatal crash to help preserve critical evidence for a victim’s family.

“An experienced attorney can help shield grieving families from large railroad companies, which often deploy their own investigative teams and have extensive resources to defend against claims,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal.

“Acting quickly is crucial in these cases to ensure that all evidence is properly examined,” Bond added.

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

Pending the outcome of the investigation, surviving family members of Gerardo Becerra Perez may have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim. In such cases, families may seek compensation for loss of companionship, emotional distress, and the pain and suffering caused by the sudden loss of a loved one.

“The emotional toll following the unexpected death of a family member can be devastating,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal.

“A wrongful death attorney can closely monitor the investigation while working to protect the legal rights and interests of the victim’s family,” Formica said.","SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities.

Surrounded by bodies after the train accident in southern Spain, one little girl somehow emerged virtually unscathed.
Newspaper La Vanguardia reported that a Civil Guard officer found her barefoot on the tracks after she escaped through a broken window.
Relative Juan Barroso told reporters the 6-year-old is in good health after receiving three stitches in her head at a hospital. The mayor of her family's village said he was finding a measure of solace in the fact this girl was out of harm's way.
“There are many people who are very sad for the victims of this terrible accident, but there were also many who survived, like the miracle of the girl who is safe,” Punta Umbria's Mayor José Carlos Hernández told reporters Tuesday after leading a minute of silence for the victims.
Among them were the girl's parents, brother and a cousin. At least 42 people were killed in the brutal accident that has shaken the nation and left the 6-year-old child an orphan.
Her family's last names are Zamorano Álvarez, the town hall said. but The Associated Press is not disclosing her first name.
Punta Umbria has declared three days of mourning for victims including the Zamorano Álvarez family. They were seated in the front carriages that bore the brunt of the impact when a train coming the opposite direction suddenly jumped its track for reasons still unknown.
Mayor Hernández said that the girl is now with her grandparents in a hotel in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash.
“She has a tremendous family who will do what it takes for her to have a happy life,” the mayor said.","BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The roar was deafening inside the train car as it hurtled off the tracks, then slid down a steep slope, ripping open its frame.

She has been identified as Elinor Peace Steffy, a 22-year-old Sacramento resident who taught at the Hawkins School of the Performing Arts in Folsom and was traveling for work at the time of her death, according to the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office.
Steffy was waiting for a light rail train on Thursday, Jan. 22, when a vehicle veered off the roadway and crashed into the station’s boarding area. Emergency responders confirmed she died at the scene.
At just 22, Steffy had already made a meaningful imprint on the community as an artist, educator and organizer who brought people together through creativity and compassion. Family members and friends described her as deeply giving and endlessly encouraging, often referring to her as “a true mover of love” for the way she unconditionally supported others and inspired those around her.
That sentiment is echoed in a memorial fundraiser launched by her family, which reflects on Steffy’s devotion to service and her ability to uplift everyone she encountered.
“We are raising funds in Elinor’s name to continue her legacy. We will be opening a non-profit organization to pursue these goals,” the family shared, noting that the planned organization will help provide dance education, master classes, workshops, and cultural exchange experiences for Sacramento youth.
On Sunday, the Hawkins School of Performing Arts also spoke about in regards to the tragedy that took the life of their beloved staff member.
“She was deeply loved and will always be cherished by her Hawkins family, and her presence will be profoundly missed by all who knew her,” the school included in its statement.
In addition to her work in dance education, Steffy and her family also helped open and operate the locally owned restaurant Good Eats Sacramento, located near the Curtis Park neighborhood, further extending her presence in the community through small business and service.
The fatal collision occurred shortly before 3 p.m. at the intersection of Folsom Boulevard and Iron Point Road, where multiple 911 calls reported a vehicle leaving Folsom Boulevard, crossing the intersection and entering the light rail station parking area. According to emergency personnel, the vehicle struck a tree before continuing toward the boarding platform, where Steffy, who was reportedly waiting to board the train, was struck and killed.
Responding units from the Folsom Fire Department and Folsom Police Department arrived to find a Tesla precariously lodged onto the light rail platform structure. A second victim, the driver of the vehicle, sustained injuries and was transported to UC Davis Medical Center with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. Authorities confirmed the fatality was a bystander and not an occupant of the vehicle.
Light rail service through the area was shut down for several hours as emergency crews worked the scene and investigators documented the crash. Folsom Police said the incident remains under active investigation and no additional information has been released regarding the cause of the collision. While details are very limited at this time, authorities noted that preliminary findings do not point to alchohol as a factor at this time.
“Before we release a cause or before we release information about the accident. We want to make sure that we have looked at everything. In a fatal collision, that means sometimes weeks and weeks, sometimes even months of work checking every possible angle and gathering all the information that we can get,” said Folsom Police Commander Andrew Bates.
Details regarding memorial services will be shared by family members at a later time. Those wishing to contribute to the memorial fundraising effort in honor of Elinor Peace Steffy can do so online here.

Deadly Crash Shuts Down Folsom Light Rail

A deadly crash shuts down Folsom light rail near Iron Point Station on Thursday afternoon, January 22, 2026, disrupting Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) service. A vehicle struck the station ramp and overturned onto the tracks, blocking service between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom stations.

Folsom police confirmed that a pedestrian was killed, and another individual was transported to a hospital for treatment. SacRT crews inspected the tracks for damage before resuming normal service around 8 p.m., with a bus bridge in place to maintain transit along the affected route.

Footage from the scene showed the sedan resting at an angle across the tracks, with damage to the station parking lot, indicating a violent collision through the area prior to impacting the tracks.

The disaster on January 18 saw a train derail and collide with another train in Adamuz, a city near Cordoba. It was the deadliest train crash in Spain since 2013, and one of the worst in Europe in recent history.

The families of the deceased will receive €216,000 each within three months, according to Transport Minister Oscar Puente.

The compensation package includes €72,000 in tax-exempt government aid and a €72,000 advance insurance payment, as well as a further €72,000 from passengers' mandatory travel insurance.

For those injured in the crash, payments will range from €2,400 to €84,000 depending on the severity of the injuries, according to Puente.

""We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

""Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain.""

Transport minister under pressure

Puente has come under increasing public scrutiny following the Adamuz crash, compounded by a string of other railway incidents that same week. A train driver died after a crash in Catalonia, while there were two other accidents without fatalities.

The main opposition People’s Party has called for the transport minister's resignation, while Spanish media report that he is under preliminary investigation for a possible criminal offence linked to the accident.

Puente told reporters on Tuesday that he had a ""clear conscience"" and was doing ""my job as best I can"".

""I am acting according to my conscience, my sense of duty, and I will take the decisions I have to take,"" he said, adding that he would demonstrate ""with deeds, not words"" the government's commitment to the crash victims.

The incident, which also left 152 people injured, occurred near the town of Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, approximately 370 kilometers south of the capital, Madrid.

The tragic event unfolded around 7:45 PM (18:45 GMT) when the rear section of a train carrying approximately 300 passengers from Malaga to Madrid derailed. This section then violently struck an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another city in southern Spain, according to details provided by rail operator Adif.

Transport Minister Oscar Puente confirmed on Monday that the death toll stood at 39, cautioning that this figure was not final. Of the 152 injured passengers, five are reported to be in critical condition, while an additional 24 sustained serious injuries, authorities stated.

Extensive Emergency Response Mobilized

In the immediate aftermath, a comprehensive emergency response was launched. Members of Spain’s Civil Guard and civil defense units worked through the night at the crash site, focusing on rescue and recovery efforts.

The Spanish Red Cross established a dedicated help center, offering crucial assistance to emergency services personnel and providing a point of contact for individuals seeking information about the victims. AvandaTimes noted that the coordinated response highlighted the scale of the disaster and the immediate need for extensive support.

Investigation Underway, Cause Undetermined

Minister Puente stated early on Monday that the precise cause of the collision remained unknown. He elaborated on the mechanics of the crash, explaining that the rear section of the first train, after derailing, impacted the front of the second train, which subsequently knocked its initial two carriages off the track and down a 4-meter (13-foot) slope.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez conveyed his deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the devastating accident, underscoring the national grief following the incident.

Spain boasts the largest high-speed rail network in Europe, featuring over 3,100 kilometers (1,900 miles) of track designed for trains traveling at speeds exceeding 250 kilometers per hour (155 miles per hour), as reported by the European Union. This network is widely regarded as a popular, competitively priced, and safe mode of transport within the country.

Renfe, the national rail company, reported that more Prethan 25 million passengers utilized its high-speed services throughout 2024, highlighting the system’s integral role in Spanish public transportation before this tragic event.","The tragic event unfolded around 7:45 PM (18:45 GMT) when the rear section of a train carrying approximately 300 passengers from Malaga to Madrid derailed.

Members of Spain’s Civil Guard and civil defense units worked through the night at the crash site, focusing on rescue and recovery efforts. The local sports center in Adamuz was swiftly converted into a makeshift hospital to manage the influx of casualties.

The Spanish Red Cross established a dedicated help center, offering crucial assistance to emergency services personnel and providing a point of contact for individuals seeking information about the victims. AvandaTimes noted that the coordinated response highlighted the scale of the disaster and the immediate need for extensive support.

Minister Puente stated early on Monday that the precise cause of the collision remained unknown. He elaborated on the mechanics of the crash, explaining that the rear section of the first train, after derailing, impacted the front of the second train, which subsequently knocked its initial two carriages off the track and down a 4-meter (13-foot) slope.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez conveyed his deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the devastating accident, underscoring the national grief following the incident.

Spain boasts the largest high-speed rail network in Europe, featuring over 3,100 kilometers (1,900 miles) of track designed for trains traveling at speeds exceeding 250 kilometers per hour (155 miles per hour), as reported by the European Union. This network is widely regarded as a popular, competitively priced, and safe mode of transport within the country.

Renfe, the national rail company, reported that more Prethan 25 million passengers utilized its high-speed services throughout 2024, highlighting the system’s integral role in Spanish public transportation before this tragic event.",,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

The tragic collision was Jan. 17 along Cowlitz Way Bridge

KELSO, WA, (January 17, 2026) - The Kelso Police Department is investigating a train-pedestrian crash on Jan. 17 that claimed the life of a Hoquiam man.

Joshua Lewis died on Saturday, Jan. 17 after being struck by an Amtrak train under the Cowlitz Way Bridge in Kelso, police say.

Joshua P. Lewis, 38, of Hoquiam died after he was struck by an Amtrak train under the Cowlitz Way Bridge underpass near N. First Avenue and Church Street in Kelso, the Cowlitz County Coroner's Office said. The coroner's office was notified at 5:11 p.m. Saturday.

Lewis was fatally struck by the Amtrak train, the coroner's office said. The cause and manner of death were not released, and the coroner stated no additional information would be provided.

The train was the Coast Starlight, which runs between Los Angeles and Seattle, authorities said. No passengers were injured. The train was delayed 3 hours and 30 minutes.

The Kelso Police Department detective division is investigating the incident.

TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION Based on recent federal data , railroad-related incidents in the United States result in roughly 950 deaths and more than 6,500 injuries each year. These incidents include train–pedestrian strikes, trespassing cases, employee injuries, passenger incidents, and highway-rail grade-crossing crashes. Train and rail-related accidents can occur for many reasons, including human error, track defects, mechanical failures, signal or communication issues, and unauthorized access to rail beds. These possibilities will all be considered by investigators. Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, said in such cases, it's also imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer to protect the rights of a victim. “Train crashes are often complex, and many factors can play a role in these types of accidents,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “A skilled attorney can protect the family of a victim from train companies, which often send their own investigators to crash sites and possess a variety of resources they can utilize in an attempt to defend their negligence. Your lawyer will advocate for you by hiring expert witnesses, locating witnesses to the crash, and reviewing applicable insurance coverage, while carefully guiding you through the legal process and vigorously protecting your best interests.”

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM Pending results of the investigation, the family of Joshua Lewis may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of love and companionship, pain, suffering and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident. “The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand just what families are forced to go through, and having their rights protected is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that their legal rights and best interests are protected.”

Probe finds work carried out during live rail operations with no warning to railway authorities or the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). Contract termination goes to the board on January 29.

The Minister of Transport, under Deputy Prime Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, is moving to terminate construction contracts with the Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd consortium after an initial probe found a contract breach. The investigation found work was carried out while passenger trains were operating, despite clear prohibitions. Investigators also found no communication between the contractor and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) on the day of the disaster. Thirty people were killed and 66 injured when part of an overhead crane collapsed onto passenger carriages of an express train. The proposal to terminate the contract will go before the SRT board this Thursday.

The Ministry of Transport has released the results of its fact-finding investigation into the crane collapse that struck a train in Sikhiu district, Nakhon Ratchasima. As a result, the ministry is preparing to submit a proposal to terminate the contract with Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited to the State Railway of Thailand board.

The contract is the first phase of the Thailand–China high-speed rail route, which was undertaken by the leading Thai firms in partnership with the China Railway Group (CREC).

The findings were announced on January 23, 2026, following a seven-day deadline ordered by the Prime Minister. Accordingly, the investigation was completed within the mandated timeframe and presented without delay. The announcement was made at a press conference chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn.

Senior Transport officials brief the media as committee reviews two crane incidents under Ministry

Senior officials from multiple agencies attended the briefing. These included Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Chayatham Phromsorn, senior ministry executives, and representatives from the State Railway of Thailand and the Department of Highways.

In addition, the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport attended in his capacity as chairman of the fact-finding committee.

The committee investigated two separate crane incidents under the Ministry of Transport’s oversight. The first involved a crane collapse onto a train at a construction site in Sikhiu district. This site forms part of the Thai–Chinese high-speed rail project under contracts 3–4. The second incident involved a crane falling onto a vehicle on Rama 2 Road during construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway.

Mr Phipat said the Prime Minister instructed that the Sikhiu incident be treated as urgent. Therefore, a fact-finding investigation was ordered immediately. The directive required completion within seven days. January 23 marked the final day of that deadline.

Investigation finds crane support base fell during active rail operations beneath construction site

According to the investigation, the object that struck the train was part of the crane’s front support base. Specifically, the component became unbalanced while being moved. As a result, it fell from the structure. At the same time, a train was passing beneath the construction area.

Crucially, investigators found that construction was underway while train services were operating. However, the contract clearly prohibits work above the railway during active train operations. Instead, work is permitted only when train movement is suspended.

Moreover, the contract requires advance notification to railway stations. This notification must be made via radio communication. The purpose is to allow stations to suspend or delay trains until the work area is cleared.

The investigation found no evidence of such communication. In particular, no radio records showed any notification from the construction site on the day of the incident. Consequently, the train entered the construction zone as scheduled.

Failure to notify railway station cited as a critical breach leading to contract termination process

As a result, the crane component fell onto the train, causing a serious accident. Mr Phipat said this failure to notify the station constituted a critical breach of contract conditions. Therefore, evidence was found to incriminate Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.

Mr Phipat said the failure was a central issue in determining contract termination. Accordingly, the Ministry of Transport is preparing to submit the matter to the State Railway of Thailand board. He emphasised that the authority to terminate contracts rests with the board, as SRT is a state enterprise.

The proposal will be submitted to the SRT board on January 29. Before that, the matter will be reviewed by the SRT legal subcommittee. Following this process, the board will make a formal decision.

“We know where the error occurred,” Mr Phipat said. He stated that the contract clearly required advance notification. However, the construction site failed to comply.

Anan Pothinimdaeng, Deputy Governor and Acting Governor of the State Railway of Thailand, provided further details. He said the January 14 incident revealed clear deficiencies in safety measures stipulated in the contract.

State Railway confirms lack of radio notice allowed train to enter the construction zone unprotected

Mr Anan explained that contractors must notify stations by radio at least one day in advance. In some cases, notification can be given up to seven days prior. This procedure allows trains to wait until construction areas are cleared.

However, a review of communication logs found no such notification. Consequently, the train moved into the construction area without warning. This directly led to the accident, he said.

Mr Anan confirmed that SRT is preparing to submit the case to its legal subcommittee. Subsequently, the issue will be placed on the agenda of the January 29 board meeting.

Meanwhile, the damaged railway section in Sikhiu district has been repaired. Following inspections, train services have resumed along the affected stretch.

Regarding casualties, officials confirmed that initial compensation has been paid. Specifically, 66 injured individuals received assistance. In addition, families of 30 people killed in the incident have received initial compensation.

Rama 2 Road crane collapse investigation continues as authorities await final conclusions

In contrast, the investigation into the Rama 2 Road incident remains ongoing. Mr Phipat said no final conclusion has yet been reached. Preliminary findings suggest the crane fell after working hours.

The Rama 2 incident occurred during the construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway. A crane collapsed onto a vehicle travelling on the roadway below, causing structural damage to the bridge.

Mr Piyapong Chiwatnakulpaishal, Director-General of the Department of Highways, addressed the situation. He said the Department of Highways, the Ministry of Transport, and the Engineering Institute of Thailand jointly assessed the site.

Following discussions, the agencies agreed to fully close the main road at the construction area. As a result, the affected section of Rama 2 Road will be closed to traffic for 60 days.

Damaged bridge sections will be demolished. In addition, remaining hazardous structures will be cleared. These include sections affected by the collapse of a low-profile girder.

Meanwhile, parallel lanes will be opened for public use. These lanes will accommodate traffic while demolition and clearing operations proceed.

High-risk construction zones faced accelerated deadlines after stability analysis flags collapse

Mr Piyapong said construction is also being accelerated at high-risk points along the bridge crossing the Tha Chin River. These areas involve extensive scaffolding and structural supports.

The Engineering Institute of Thailand conducted an initial stability analysis. The analysis found that prolonged instability posed a collapse risk. Therefore, urgent completion of work was recommended.

As a result, construction in these areas must be completed within 60 days. Delays would increase safety risks, according to the institute.

Mr Piyapong said the suspension of work also serves as a punitive measure. Specifically, it reduces the contractor’s remaining construction time. Moreover, the contractor cannot request additional compensation.

Originally, the project was scheduled to open in April. However, delays caused by the incident will push the opening back. If work is not completed by May 2026, penalties will apply.

Daily fines and possible termination considered as the Highways Department moves to enforcement

The penalty rate is set at 0.25 per cent of the contract value per day. The contract is valued at 1.8 billion baht. Therefore, the daily fine amounts to approximately 4.7 million baht.

Meanwhile, the Department of Highways is preparing for possible contract termination. To that end, a three-party committee has been established.

The committee includes the Department of Highways, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Department of the Comptroller General. It will examine legal conditions and termination rights.

However, if the contractor resumes work, strict conditions will apply. First, the construction site must be fully safe. Second, all machinery must be inspected and fitted with additional alarm sensors.

Third, a new and reliable team of engineers and workers must be appointed. Fourth, the Engineering Institute of Thailand must oversee work continuously. Finally, progress must be reported publicly.

Permanent Secretary Chayatham Phromsorn addressed broader enforcement measures. He said contractor grading, point deductions, demotion, and blacklisting fall under the Ministry of Finance.

Transport ministry pushes contractor penalties despite limits on downgrade authority

These mechanisms are administered by the Comptroller General’s Department. Although relevant regulations already exist, procedural details remain pending.

Nevertheless, Mr Chayatham said the Ministry of Transport has pursued construction safety measures for over three years. Systems, documentation and oversight guidelines were already developed.

However, authority to downgrade contractors remains limited. Such actions must comply with central criteria.

Despite this, the ministry will not wait for full central approval. Accordingly, a separate committee has been established to expedite implementation.

Meanwhile, new penalties have been added to construction contracts under transport agencies. These focus on projects involving serious accidents resulting in death.

Italian-Thai Development accepts responsibility. Firm outlines compensation and safety checks

Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited responded to the findings through Senior Executive Vice President Sumet Surabotsopon. He said the company accepts responsibility for the investigation results.

Mr Sumet said ITD is ready for scrutiny at every stage. He confirmed that initial assistance was paid immediately to injured parties and families of the deceased.

He said compensation exceeding one million baht per person has been prepared. This is in addition to insurance payments and compensation from the State Railway of Thailand.

Mr Sumet said all equipment and machinery met engineering standards. Load-bearing capacity was regularly checked. Rented cranes were inspected by consultants and site supervisors.

Company denies legal action plans as internal penalties reviewed and investigations continue

He said the incidents may have resulted from deficiencies in operational procedures. Nevertheless, the company is ready to accept responsibility. He said the incidents do not reflect all Italian-Thai projects. Instead, they relate to specific operational circumstances.

Mr Sumet denied reports that the company plans to sue the government. He said such claims were untrue. He also confirmed the company’s liquidity remains normal. Accordingly, financial issues have not affected safety standards or material quality. He said a central safety committee oversees all project sites.

He added that a special task force is reviewing internal penalties for negligence. He requested an opportunity to improve operations. The Ministry of Transport said investigations into both incidents remain ongoing. Further legal and administrative action will depend on final determinations.

Mr Anan confirmed that SRT is preparing to submit the case to its legal subcommittee. Subsequently, the issue will be placed on the agenda of the January 29 board meeting.

Meanwhile, the damaged railway section in Sikhiu district has been repaired. Following inspections, train services have resumed along the affected stretch.

Regarding casualties, officials confirmed that initial compensation has been paid. Specifically, 66 injured individuals received assistance. In addition, families of 30 people killed in the incident have received initial compensation.

Rama 2 Road crane collapse investigation continues as authorities await final conclusions

In contrast, the investigation into the Rama 2 Road incident remains ongoing. Mr Phipat said no final conclusion has yet been reached. Preliminary findings suggest the crane fell after working hours.

The Rama 2 incident occurred during the construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway. A crane collapsed onto a vehicle travelling on the roadway below, causing structural damage to the bridge.

Mr Piyapong Chiwatnakulpaishal, Director-General of the Department of Highways, addressed the situation. He said the Department of Highways, the Ministry of Transport, and the Engineering Institute of Thailand jointly assessed the site.

Following discussions, the agencies agreed to fully close the main road at the construction area. As a result, the affected section of Rama 2 Road will be closed to traffic for 60 days.

Damaged bridge sections will be demolished. In addition, remaining hazardous structures will be cleared. These include sections affected by the collapse of a low-profile girder.

Meanwhile, parallel lanes will be opened for public use. These lanes will accommodate traffic while demolition and clearing operations proceed.

High-risk construction zones faced accelerated deadlines after stability analysis flags collapse

Mr Piyapong said construction is also being accelerated at high-risk points along the bridge crossing the Tha Chin River. These areas involve extensive scaffolding and structural supports.

The Engineering Institute of Thailand conducted an initial stability analysis. The analysis found that prolonged instability posed a collapse risk. Therefore, urgent completion of work was recommended.

As a result, construction in these areas must be completed within 60 days. Delays would increase safety risks, according to the institute.

Mr Piyapong said the suspension of work also serves as a punitive measure. Specifically, it reduces the contractor’s remaining construction time. Moreover, the contractor cannot request additional compensation.

Originally, the project was scheduled to open in April. However, delays caused by the incident will push the opening back. If work is not completed by May 2026, penalties will apply.

Daily fines and possible termination considered as the Highways Department moves to enforcement

The penalty rate is set at 0.25 per cent of the contract value per day. The contract is valued at 1.8 billion baht. Therefore, the daily fine amounts to approximately 4.7 million baht.

Meanwhile, the Department of Highways is preparing for possible contract termination. To that end, a three-party committee has been established.

The committee includes the Department of Highways, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Department of the Comptroller General. It will examine legal conditions and termination rights.

However, if the contractor resumes work, strict conditions will apply. First, the construction site must be fully safe. Second, all machinery must be inspected and fitted with additional alarm sensors.

Third, a new and reliable team of engineers and workers must be appointed. Fourth, the Engineering Institute of Thailand must oversee work continuously. Finally, progress must be reported publicly.

Permanent Secretary Chayatham Phromsorn addressed broader enforcement measures. He said contractor grading, point deductions, demotion, and blacklisting fall under the Ministry of Finance.

Transport ministry pushes contractor penalties despite limits on downgrade authority

These mechanisms are administered by the Comptroller General’s Department. Although relevant regulations already exist, procedural details remain pending.

Nevertheless, Mr Chayatham said the Ministry of Transport has pursued construction safety measures for over three years. Systems, documentation and oversight guidelines were already developed.

However, authority to downgrade contractors remains limited. Such actions must comply with central criteria.

Despite this, the ministry will not wait for full central approval. Accordingly, a separate committee has been established to expedite implementation.

Meanwhile, new penalties have been added to construction contracts under transport agencies. These focus on projects involving serious accidents resulting in death.

Italian-Thai Development accepts responsibility. Firm outlines compensation and safety checks

Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited responded to the findings through Senior Executive Vice President Sumet Surabotsopon. He said the company accepts responsibility for the investigation results.

Mr Sumet said ITD is ready for scrutiny at every stage. He confirmed that initial assistance was paid immediately to injured parties and families of the deceased.

He said compensation exceeding one million baht per person has been prepared. This is in addition to insurance payments and compensation from the State Railway of Thailand.

Mr Sumet said all equipment and machinery met engineering standards. Load-bearing capacity was regularly checked. Rented cranes were inspected by consultants and site supervisors.

Company denies legal action plans as internal penalties reviewed and investigations continue

He said the incidents may have resulted from deficiencies in operational procedures. Nevertheless, the company is ready to accept responsibility. He said the incidents do not reflect all Italian-Thai projects. Instead, they relate to specific operational circumstances.

Mr Sumet denied reports that the company plans to sue the government. He said such claims were untrue. He also confirmed the company’s liquidity remains normal. Accordingly, financial issues have not affected safety standards or material quality. He said a central safety committee oversees all project sites.

He added that a special task force is reviewing internal penalties for negligence. He requested an opportunity to improve operations. The Ministry of Transport said investigations into both incidents remain ongoing. Further legal and administrative action will depend on final determinations.

Probe finds work carried out during live rail operations with no warning to railway authorities or the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). Contract termination goes to the board on January 29.
The Minister of Transport, under Deputy Prime Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, is moving to terminate construction contracts with the Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd consortium after an initial probe found a contract breach. The investigation found work was carried out while passenger trains were operating, despite clear prohibitions. Investigators also found no communication between the contractor and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) on the day of the disaster. Thirty people were killed and 66 injured when part of an overhead crane collapsed onto passenger carriages of an express train. The proposal to terminate the contract will go before the SRT board this Thursday.
The Ministry of Transport has released the results of its fact-finding investigation into the crane collapse that struck a train in Sikhiu district, Nakhon Ratchasima. As a result, the ministry is preparing to submit a proposal to terminate the contract with Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited to the State Railway of Thailand board.
The contract is the first phase of the Thailand–China high-speed rail route, which was undertaken by the leading Thai firms in partnership with the China Railway Group (CREC).
The findings were announced on January 23, 2026, following a seven-day deadline ordered by the Prime Minister. Accordingly, the investigation was completed within the mandated timeframe and presented without delay. The announcement was made at a press conference chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn.
Senior Transport officials brief the media as committee reviews two crane incidents under Ministry
Senior officials from multiple agencies attended the briefing. These included Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport Chayatham Phromsorn, senior ministry executives, and representatives from the State Railway of Thailand and the Department of Highways.
In addition, the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport attended in his capacity as chairman of the fact-finding committee.
The committee investigated two separate crane incidents under the Ministry of Transport’s oversight. The first involved a crane collapse onto a train at a construction site in Sikhiu district. This site forms part of the Thai–Chinese high-speed rail project under contracts 3–4. The second incident involved a crane falling onto a vehicle on Rama 2 Road during construction of the Bang Khun Thian–Ban Phaeo intercity expressway.
Mr Phipat said the Prime Minister instructed that the Sikhiu incident be treated as urgent. Therefore, a fact-finding investigation was ordered immediately. The directive required completion within seven days. January 23 marked the final day of that deadline.
Investigation finds crane support base fell during active rail operations beneath construction site
According to the investigation, the object that struck the train was part of the crane’s front support base. Specifically, the component became unbalanced while being moved. As a result, it fell from the structure. At the same time, a train was passing beneath the construction area.
Crucially, investigators found that construction was underway while train services were operating. However, the contract clearly prohibits work above the railway during active train operations. Instead, work is permitted only when train movement is suspended.
Moreover, the contract requires advance notification to railway stations. This notification must be made via radio communication. The purpose is to allow stations to suspend or delay trains until the work area is cleared.
The investigation found no evidence of such communication. In particular, no radio records showed any notification from the construction site on the day of the incident. Consequently, the train entered the construction zone as scheduled.
Failure to notify railway station cited as a critical breach leading to contract termination process
As a result, the crane component fell onto the train, causing a serious accident. Mr Phipat said this failure to notify the station constituted a critical breach of contract conditions. Therefore, evidence was found to incriminate Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited.
Mr Phipat said the failure was a central issue in determining contract termination. Accordingly, the Ministry of Transport is preparing to submit the matter to the State Railway of Thailand board. He emphasised that the authority to terminate contracts rests with the board, as SRT is a state enterprise.
The proposal will be submitted to the SRT board on January 29. Before that, the matter will be reviewed by the SRT legal subcommittee. Following this process, the board will make a formal decision.
“We know where the error occurred,” Mr Phipat said. He stated that the contract clearly required advance notification. However, the construction site failed to comply.
Anan Pothinimdaeng, Deputy Governor and Acting Governor of the State Railway of Thailand, provided further details. He said the January 14 incident revealed clear deficiencies in safety measures stipulated in the contract.
State Railway confirms lack of radio notice allowed train to enter the construction zone unprotected

Mr Piyapong Chiwatnakulpaishal, Director-General of the Department of Highways, addressed the situation. He said the Department of Highways, the Ministry of Transport, and the Engineering Institute of Thailand jointly assessed the site.

Following discussions, the agencies agreed to fully close the main road at the construction area. As a result, the affected section of Rama 2 Road will be closed to traffic for 60 days.

Damaged bridge sections will be demolished. In addition, remaining hazardous structures will be cleared. These include sections affected by the collapse of a low-profile girder.

Meanwhile, parallel lanes will be opened for public use. These lanes will accommodate traffic while demolition and clearing operations proceed.

Mr Piyapong said construction is also being accelerated at high-risk points along the bridge crossing the Tha Chin River. These areas involve extensive scaffolding and structural supports.

The Engineering Institute of Thailand conducted an initial stability analysis. The analysis found that prolonged instability posed a collapse risk. Therefore, urgent completion of work was recommended.

As a result, construction in these areas must be completed within 60 days. Delays would increase safety risks, according to the institute.

Mr Piyapong said the suspension of work also serves as a punitive measure. Specifically, it reduces the contractor’s remaining construction time. Moreover, the contractor cannot request additional compensation.

Originally, the project was scheduled to open in April. However, delays caused by the incident will push the opening back. If work is not completed by May 2026, penalties will apply.

Daily fines and possible termination considered as the Highways Department moves to enforcement

The penalty rate is set at 0.25 per cent of the contract value per day. The contract is valued at 1.8 billion baht. Therefore, the daily fine amounts to approximately 4.7 million baht.

Meanwhile, the Department of Highways is preparing for possible contract termination. To that end, a three-party committee has been established.

The committee includes the Department of Highways, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Department of the Comptroller General. It will examine legal conditions and termination rights.

However, if the contractor resumes work, strict conditions will apply. First, the construction site must be fully safe. Second, all machinery must be inspected and fitted with additional alarm sensors.

Third, a new and reliable team of engineers and workers must be appointed. Fourth, the Engineering Institute of Thailand must oversee work continuously. Finally, progress must be reported publicly.

Permanent Secretary Chayatham Phromsorn addressed broader enforcement measures. He said contractor grading, point deductions, demotion, and blacklisting fall under the Ministry of Finance.

These mechanisms are administered by the Comptroller General’s Department. Although relevant regulations already exist, procedural details remain pending.

Nevertheless, Mr Chayatham said the Ministry of Transport has pursued construction safety measures for over three years. Systems, documentation and oversight guidelines were already developed.

However, authority to downgrade contractors remains limited. Such actions must comply with central criteria.

Despite this, the ministry will not wait for full central approval. Accordingly, a separate committee has been established to expedite implementation.

Meanwhile, new penalties have been added to construction contracts under transport agencies. These focus on projects involving serious accidents resulting in death.

Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited responded to the findings through Senior Executive Vice President Sumet Surabotsopon. He said the company accepts responsibility for the investigation results.

Mr Sumet said ITD is ready for scrutiny at every stage. He confirmed that initial assistance was paid immediately to injured parties and families of the deceased.

He said compensation exceeding one million baht per person has been prepared. This is in addition to insurance payments and compensation from the State Railway of Thailand.

Mr Sumet said all equipment and machinery met engineering standards. Load-bearing capacity was regularly checked. Rented cranes were inspected by consultants and site supervisors.

He said the incidents may have resulted from deficiencies in operational procedures. Nevertheless, the company is ready to accept responsibility. He said the incidents do not reflect all Italian-Thai projects. Instead, they relate to specific operational circumstances.

Mr Sumet denied reports that the company plans to sue the government. He said such claims were untrue. He also confirmed the company’s liquidity remains normal. Accordingly, financial issues have not affected safety standards or material quality. He said a central safety committee oversees all project sites.

TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Based on recent federal data, railroad-related incidents in the United States result in roughly 950 deaths and more than 6,500 injuries each year. These incidents include train–pedestrian strikes, trespassing cases, employee injuries, passenger incidents, and highway-rail grade-crossing crashes.

Train and rail-related accidents can occur for many reasons, including human error, track defects, mechanical failures, signal or communication issues, and unauthorized access to rail beds.

All of these factors will be carefully reviewed as part of the investigation. Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, noted that in cases like this, it is also critical to have an independent inquiry conducted by a seasoned lawyer to help protect the rights of the victim’s family.

“Train crashes are often complex, and multiple elements can contribute to these incidents,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “A skilled attorney can safeguard a victim’s family from rail companies that deploy their own investigators to accident scenes and possess extensive resources to defend against negligence claims. Legal counsel can advocate by securing expert analysis, identifying witnesses, reviewing insurance coverage, and guiding families through the legal process while vigorously protecting their best interests.”

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

Pending results of the investigation, the family of Joshua Lewis may be entitled to pursue a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of love and companionship, pain, suffering, and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident.

“The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand what families are forced to go through, and having their rights protected is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that their legal rights and best interests are protected.”","KELSO, WA (January 17, 2026) – A Hoquiam man was killed Saturday evening after being struck by an Amtrak train under the Cowlitz Way Bridge in Kelso, authorities said.

ESSEX COUNTY, NJ — Federal investigators have released preliminary findings from their investigation into a NJ Transit train derailment that recently took place in North Jersey.

The derailment took place in Montclair on the evening of Dec. 19, temporarily suspending rail service on a stretch of the Montclair-Boonton line. Authorities initially reported that 17 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Six people – each NJ Transit crew members – were hospitalized and later released. All 11 passengers declined medical transport. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released an update about their ongoing investigation into the derailment, which caused about $180,000 in damages.

According to the NTSB, the incident took place at 6:47 p.m. when an eastbound commuter train collided with a stopped commuter train that had 11 passengers on board. The eastbound train had one cab car, four passenger cars and one pushing locomotive. The other train had one cab car, two passenger cars and one pushing locomotive.

Both trains were crewed by one conductor, one engineer and one brakeman. Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were “dark and clear with no precipitation,” the NTSB reported.

Before the accident, both trains were westbound traveling on track 1. However, due to downed trees blocking the track – a result of a storm earlier that evening – NJ Transit rerouted the trains, having them turn back east and operate on track 2.

Before the accident, both trains were westbound traveling on track 1. However, due to downed trees blocking the track – a result of a storm earlier that evening – NJ Transit rerouted the trains, having them turn back east and operate on track 2.
Here’s what happened next, the NTSB said:
“The struck train was stopped on track 2 waiting for a train ahead to depart Bay Street Station. The collision occurred in a sharp right-hand curve on a downhill grade with about 126 feet of limited sight distance when the standing train could first be seen … At the time of the collision, the striking train was operating on a stop and proceed signal indication that required movement under restricted-speed rules. The striking train collided with the stopped train at 17 mph. Three cars from the striking train derailed and one car from the struck train derailed.”
According to the NTSB, investigators at the scene inspected the track, signals and equipment, performed “sight-distance observations” using exemplar trains, reviewed event recorder data and performed interviews. Federal investigators have requested documents including the NJ Transit dispatcher radio and telephone recordings.
An investigation continues, the agency said last week.
“Future investigative activity will focus on NJ Transit’s internal oversight, operational procedure and Positive Train Control functionality on trains operating at restricted speed,” the NTSB added.

All 11 passengers declined medical transport.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released an update about their ongoing investigation into the derailment, which caused about $180,000 in damages.

Father Fatally Stabbed In Front Of 3 Small Kids In Mercer County: Prosecutor
According to the NTSB, the incident took place at 6:47 p.m. when an eastbound commuter train collided with a stopped commuter train that had 11 passengers on board.
The eastbound train had one cab car, four passenger cars and one pushing locomotive. The other train had one cab car, two passenger cars and one pushing locomotive.

Both trains were crewed by one conductor, one engineer and one brakeman.
Visibility conditions at the time of the accident were “dark and clear with no precipitation,” the NTSB reported.
Before the accident, both trains were westbound traveling on track 1. However, due to downed trees blocking the track – a result of a storm earlier that evening – NJ Transit rerouted the trains, having them turn back east and operate on track 2.
Here’s what happened next, the NTSB said:
“The struck train was stopped on track 2 waiting for a train ahead to depart Bay Street Station. The collision occurred in a sharp right-hand curve on a downhill grade with about 126 feet of limited sight distance when the standing train could first be seen … At the time of the collision, the striking train was operating on a stop and proceed signal indication that required movement under restricted-speed rules. The striking train collided with the stopped train at 17 mph. Three cars from the striking train derailed and one car from the struck train derailed.”
According to the NTSB, investigators at the scene inspected the track, signals and equipment, performed “sight-distance observations” using exemplar trains, reviewed event recorder data and performed interviews. Federal investigators have requested documents including the NJ Transit dispatcher radio and telephone recordings.
An investigation continues, the agency said last week.
“Future investigative activity will focus on NJ Transit’s internal oversight, operational procedure and Positive Train Control functionality on trains operating at restricted speed,” the NTSB added.

Fruzsina De Cloedt reports.

A Saskatchewan man is calling for changes to a rail crossing in the community of Churchbridge, after losing his wife in a fatal train collision just a month after their wedding.

Alyssa and Matthew Thompson were wed in Mexico in November 2025. It was a joyous occasion, and things were looking up for the young couple. The pair bought a house in the town of Churchbridge, Sask., just down the street from their previous rental, with Matthew calling it fate.

Their new home was filled with life, and they shared it with Alyssa’s eight-year-old son and their many rescue cats.

“[Alyssa] was charismatic, full of life and energy and she was just a beautiful soul inside and out,” Matthew told CTV News.

Whenever time allowed, the family went hiking and they loved travelling together; little trinkets hanging from their living room walls serve as reminders.

The crash

The morning of Dec. 29, 2025, was like any other morning for the Thompson family, as Alyssa was getting ready to go to work.

“She worked at a care home, and she loved all there is to [it]. She really spent her whole life just caring for others more than she cared for herself,” he said.

Alyssa had asked Matthew to brew her coffee, then he kissed her goodbye as she left for work in her red SUV.

It was early in the morning and still dark outside. About 10 minutes later, Matthew received a text from his mother-in-law, who works at the nearby Langenburg Hospital.

“She’d heard that the ambulance got dispatched to a train accident, so I pretty much instantly just threw on my shoes and ran down the street, to the train there,” Matthew recalled.

The railroad crossing is one of two in Churchbridge, located at the end of their street, merely a few minutes from the house. There were already people on the scene of the accident, but the vehicle was out of sight.

“There was a guy standing there and I asked what kind of vehicle it was. He said it was a red SUV. And I said, ‘I think that’s my wife,’” Matthew said.

Matthew then climbed across the train to get to the other side of the tracks, but one of his acquaintances from the fire department told him not to go to the scene, confirming his fears.

“Nobody could really say anything at the time. I was asking, you know, ‘Is she responsive? Is she breathing and talking?’ type of things, but I don’t think anybody was really allowed to say [anything] until the police got there,” he said.

Matthew lost his wife that morning. Alyssa was 29 years old.

“It’s been three weeks, almost a month [since losing her]. And I still feel the same, you know ... empty,” he said.

Matthew was devastated and said he needed a few weeks to become “half normal.” He didn’t know much about the circumstances of the accident, so he reached out to the Canada Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) railway for details of the collision, wanting to know if any of the parties were at fault.

He says neither CPKC nor the RCMP Esterhazy detachment had any additional information for him, and he was not provided with the incident report either.

“They responded that they wouldn’t be releasing that information to me. I would just like some answers as towards what might have happened,” Matthew explained.

In particular, he wanted to know whether the train driver reduced speed and/or used its warning lights and sounds that morning.

A dangerous crossing

Matthew and Alyssa were aware that the crossing wasn’t equipped with lights, having lived in Churchbridge for the past four years. He told CTV News that they regularly reminded each other to be careful when passing through the intersection.

“If you stop behind the stop line, you see the house, you see the tree line, and you just see black,” he described the location. “It’s uphill, it’s slippery, it’s covered with ice most of the time.”

Matthew has been driving through it constantly when it’s dark outside, “to see what it is that she might have seen that morning.”

In his experience, drivers must get close to the tracks to see if there is a train approaching due to the obstructions, which is unsafe due to the icy surface.

“If there was a set of lights there, at least you’d know to not even pull out to look,” he added.

Calls for action

Following his wife’s death, Matthew asked the railway company to install lights at the crossing in an effort to prevent further tragedies. But he says he was told no.

“What amount of money is worth all the lives that it’s costed there?” he asked. “To me, there’s no price you could put on my wife’s life.”

According to Statistics Canada, the population of Churchbridge was just shy of 900 in 2021. Many of its residents work in the nearby towns, such as Yorkton and Esterhazy, generating a constant flow of traffic through its two railroad crossings.

CTV News reached out to both CPKC and the RCMP. While the RCMP confirmed the accident, they didn’t provide additional information.

In their response to CTV News, CPKC expressed its deepest sympathies to the family.

The railway company said the grade crossing regulations and standards are established by Transport Canada.

“The sight lines at the Lovel Street crossing are compliant with those regulations,” the statement read.

According to Transport Canada’s database, there had already been two accidents in the crossing where Alyssa lost her life. Almost exactly three years ago, a 41-year-old father was killed in a crash at the intersection. His two children were also injured.

“I’d like to hope that in the future something gets done about it, even a set of lights put in there so that we could prevent [fatal accidents] from happening to any other families in the future,” Matthew said.

The newlyweds had already booked their honeymoon for March, a trip Matthew and his stepson will go on together, bringing Alyssa’s ashes along to scatter at a place she would have loved very much.

“I think about the future, and it’s hard to imagine getting any sort of joy out of these goals we’ve made together,” he said. “When the person that I made the goals with isn’t with me anymore.”","A Saskatchewan man is calling for changes to a rail crossing in the community of Churchbridge, after losing his wife in a fatal train collision just a month after their wedding.

“What amount of money is worth all the lives that it’s costed there?” he asked. “To me, there’s no price you could put on my wife’s life.”

In their response to CTV News, CPKC expressed its deepest sympathies to the family.
The railway company said the grade crossing regulations and standards are established by Transport Canada.
“The sight lines at the Lovel Street crossing are compliant with those regulations,” the statement read.
According to Transport Canada’s database, there had already been two accidents in the crossing where Alyssa lost her life. Almost exactly three years ago, a 41-year-old father was killed in a crash at the intersection. His two children were also injured.
“I’d like to hope that in the future something gets done about it, even a set of lights put in there so that we could prevent [fatal accidents] from happening to any other families in the future,” Matthew said.

Fruzsina De Cloedt reports.

A Saskatchewan man is calling for changes to a rail crossing in the community of Churchbridge, after losing his wife in a fatal train collision just a month after their wedding.

Alyssa and Matthew Thompson were wed in Mexico in November 2025. It was a joyous occasion, and things were looking up for the young couple. The pair bought a house in the town of Churchbridge, Sask., just down the street from their previous rental, with Matthew calling it fate.

Their new home was filled with life, and they shared it with Alyssa’s eight-year-old son and their many rescue cats.

“[Alyssa] was charismatic, full of life and energy and she was just a beautiful soul inside and out,” Matthew told CTV News.

Whenever time allowed, the family went hiking and they loved travelling together; little trinkets hanging from their living room walls serve as reminders.

The crash

The morning of Dec. 29, 2025, was like any other morning for the Thompson family, as Alyssa was getting ready to go to work.

“She worked at a care home, and she loved all there is to [it]. She really spent her whole life just caring for others more than she cared for herself,” he said.

Alyssa had asked Matthew to brew her coffee, then he kissed her goodbye as she left for work in her red SUV.

It was early in the morning and still dark outside. About 10 minutes later, Matthew received a text from his mother-in-law, who works at the nearby Langenburg Hospital.

“She’d heard that the ambulance got dispatched to a train accident, so I pretty much instantly just threw on my shoes and ran down the street, to the train there,” Matthew recalled.

The railroad crossing is one of two in Churchbridge, located at the end of their street, merely a few minutes from the house. There were already people on the scene of the accident, but the vehicle was out of sight.

“There was a guy standing there and I asked what kind of vehicle it was. He said it was a red SUV. And I said, ‘I think that’s my wife,’” Matthew said.

Matthew then climbed across the train to get to the other side of the tracks, but one of his acquaintances from the fire department told him not to go to the scene, confirming his fears.

“Nobody could really say anything at the time. I was asking, you know, ‘Is she responsive? Is she breathing and talking?’ type of things, but I don’t think anybody was really allowed to say [anything] until the police got there,” he said.

Matthew lost his wife that morning. Alyssa was 29 years old.

“It’s been three weeks, almost a month [since losing her]. And I still feel the same, you know ... empty,” he said.

Matthew was devastated and said he needed a few weeks to become “half normal.” He didn’t know much about the circumstances of the accident, so he reached out to the Canada Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) railway for details of the collision, wanting to know if any of the parties were at fault.

He says neither CPKC nor the RCMP Esterhazy detachment had any additional information for him, and he was not provided with the incident report either.

“They responded that they wouldn’t be releasing that information to me. I would just like some answers as towards what might have happened,” Matthew explained.

In particular, he wanted to know whether the train driver reduced speed and/or used its warning lights and sounds that morning.

A dangerous crossing

Matthew and Alyssa were aware that the crossing wasn’t equipped with lights, having lived in Churchbridge for the past four years. He told CTV News that they regularly reminded each other to be careful when passing through the intersection.

“If you stop behind the stop line, you see the house, you see the tree line, and you just see black,” he described the location. “It’s uphill, it’s slippery, it’s covered with ice most of the time.”

Matthew has been driving through it constantly when it’s dark outside, “to see what it is that she might have seen that morning.”

In his experience, drivers must get close to the tracks to see if there is a train approaching due to the obstructions, which is unsafe due to the icy surface.

“If there was a set of lights there, at least you’d know to not even pull out to look,” he added.

Following his wife’s death, Matthew asked the railway company to install lights at the crossing in an effort to prevent further tragedies. But he says he was told no.

FOLSOM, Calif. — Family and friends are remembering a beloved dance instructor who died Thursday after she was struck by a driver at a Folsom light rail station.

Elinor Peace Steffy, 22, of Sacramento, died from blunt force injuries she suffered in the crash at Iron Point Road and Folsom Boulevard, Sacramento County Coroner's Office records show.

Over the weekend, her father James Weems said he received a call telling him his daughter had been struck by a driver at the Iron Point Light Rail Station. He visited the crash site Sunday night and struggled to understand how the car struck his daughter before ending up on the tracks, he said.

On Monday, he told ABC10 he hopes his daughter did not suffer.

""I hope she didn't see it coming. Because, I try to think about that. That's what I was trying to see last night. But I couldn't see it,"" Weems said.

He said her loss is still difficult to understand.

""I've tried to make some sort of sense of it and all that kind of stuff, but it's kind of hard,"" Weems said through tears.

Steffy was reportedly on her way to work as a dance instructor at the Hawkins School of Performing Arts in Folsom. Dance was part of her life from an early age, her father said.

Who was Elinor Steffy?

Elinor Steffy’s mother, Delcy, said the family is profoundly grieving the loss of their beloved daughter whose light shined brightly and impacted many people.

Steffy was well known in the local dance community, including at The Torch Club, where her friends said she was a regular on Sundays and recognized for her dance moves.

Abigail Gibson, Steffy's friend, said she brought energy wherever she went and was passionate about dance, the people she taught and the community she built.

""She was just the life of the party everywhere she went,"" Gibson said. ""It was kind of impossible to be in a bad mood around her. She was always moving, always singing, always dancing.""

Steffy's family is working to establish a nonprofit in her name to ensure her legacy continues, according to her friends.

The family has set up a GoFundMe to raise money for the nonprofit, which they said will support dance education, master classes, workshops and cultural exchange experiences for Sacramento youth.

Elijah Weber, another friend, said the plans are still taking shape.

""Everything is still all in the works. This is all very sudden, but right now we're trying to contribute all community funds to further her legacy, especially in the arts, specifically with dance and children, kind of furthering the love that she loved to give to everyone,"" Weber said.

Weems said his hope is that his daughter left a lasting impression on the children she taught and that their futures reflect the impact she had on them.

What is known about the crash?

A sedan collided with Steffy around 2:50 p.m. Thursday at the Iron Point Light Rail Station, authorities said.

The car was heading west, downhill and through a parking lot on Iron Point Road when it struck a raised platform and came to a rest at an angle on the light rail tracks, according to Folsom Police Department spokesman Cmdr. Andrew Bates.

Steffy was pronounced dead on scene, per law enforcement. The driver, identified as a woman, was taken to the hospital for injuries she suffered in the crash, Bates said.

Preliminary findings indicate alcohol does not appear to have been a factor in the crash, though the crash's cause remains under investigation, police said.

""Before we release a cause or before we release information about the accident, we want to make sure that we have looked at everything,"" Bates said. ""Unfortunately, in a fatal collision, that means sometimes weeks and weeks, sometimes even months of work checking every possible angle and gathering all the information that we can get.""

A bus bridge had been in place between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom light rail stations after the crash due to the blocked tracks, according to Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT).

""I've tried to make some sort of sense of it and all that kind of stuff, but it's kind of hard,"" Weems said through tears.

Steffy was reportedly on her way to work as a dance instructor at the Hawkins School of Performing Arts in Folsom. Dance was part of her life from an early age, her father said.

Steffy was well known in the local dance community, including at The Torch Club, where her friends said she was a regular on Sundays and recognized for her dance moves.

Abigail Gibson, Steffy's friend, said she brought energy wherever she went and was passionate about dance, the people she taught and the community she built.

""She was just the life of the party everywhere she went,"" Gibson said. ""It was kind of impossible to be in a bad mood around her. She was always moving, always singing, always dancing.""

""Everything is still all in the works. This is all very sudden, but right now we're trying to contribute all community funds to further her legacy, especially in the arts, specifically with dance and children, kind of furthering the love that she loved to give to everyone,"" Weber said.

Weems said his hope is that his daughter left a lasting impression on the children she taught and that their futures reflect the impact she had on them.

FOLSOM, Calif. — Family and friends are remembering a beloved dance instructor who died Thursday after she was struck by a driver at a Folsom light rail station.

Elinor Peace Steffy, 22, of Sacramento, died from blunt force injuries she suffered in the crash at Iron Point Road and Folsom Boulevard, Sacramento County Coroner's Office records show.

Over the weekend, her father James Weems said he received a call telling him his daughter had been struck by a driver at the Iron Point Light Rail Station. He visited the crash site Sunday night and struggled to understand how the car struck his daughter before ending up on the tracks, he said.

On Monday, he told ABC10 he hopes his daughter did not suffer.

""I hope she didn't see it coming. Because, I try to think about that. That's what I was trying to see last night. But I couldn't see it,"" Weems said.

He said her loss is still difficult to understand.

""I've tried to make some sort of sense of it and all that kind of stuff, but it's kind of hard,"" Weems said through tears.

Steffy was reportedly on her way to work as a dance instructor at the Hawkins School of Performing Arts in Folsom. Dance was part of her life from an early age, her father said.

Who was Elinor Steffy?

Elinor Steffy’s mother, Delcy, said the family is profoundly grieving the loss of their beloved daughter whose light shined brightly and impacted many people.

Steffy was well known in the local dance community, including at The Torch Club, where her friends said she was a regular on Sundays and recognized for her dance moves.

Abigail Gibson, Steffy's friend, said she brought energy wherever she went and was passionate about dance, the people she taught and the community she built.

""She was just the life of the party everywhere she went,"" Gibson said. ""It was kind of impossible to be in a bad mood around her. She was always moving, always singing, always dancing.""

Steffy's family is working to establish a nonprofit in her name to ensure her legacy continues, according to her friends.

The family has set up a GoFundMe to raise money for the nonprofit, which they said will support dance education, master classes, workshops and cultural exchange experiences for Sacramento youth.

Elijah Weber, another friend, said the plans are still taking shape.

""Everything is still all in the works. This is all very sudden, but right now we're trying to contribute all community funds to further her legacy, especially in the arts, specifically with dance and children, kind of furthering the love that she loved to give to everyone,"" Weber said.

Weems said his hope is that his daughter left a lasting impression on the children she taught and that their futures reflect the impact she had on them.

What is known about the crash?

A sedan collided with Steffy around 2:50 p.m. Thursday at the Iron Point Light Rail Station, authorities said.

The car was heading west, downhill and through a parking lot on Iron Point Road when it struck a raised platform and came to a rest at an angle on the light rail tracks, according to Folsom Police Department spokesman Cmdr. Andrew Bates.

Steffy was pronounced dead on scene, per law enforcement. The driver, identified as a woman, was taken to the hospital for injuries she suffered in the crash, Bates said.

Preliminary findings indicate alcohol does not appear to have been a factor in the crash, though the crash's cause remains under investigation, police said.

""Before we release a cause or before we release information about the accident, we want to make sure that we have looked at everything,"" Bates said. ""Unfortunately, in a fatal collision, that means sometimes weeks and weeks, sometimes even months of work checking every possible angle and gathering all the information that we can get.""

“The Union Pacific team delivered our best ever full year across safety, service and operating excellence,” CEO Jim Vena said on the railroad’s earnings call on Tuesday morning. “As we close out the year, it’s clear the team is consistently delivering at the highest levels, and I’m confident that’s what we’ll continue to do.”

For the year, operating income rose 1%, to $9.8 billion, as revenue rose 1%, to $24.5 billion. Overall volume also was up 1%. Earnings per share grew 8%, to $11.09. The railroad’s operating ratio was 59.8%, an improvement of 0.1 points.

“We remain disciplined, setting the best ever full-year record for workforce productivity as we utilized 3% fewer employees to move 1% more volume,” Vena said.

Fourth-quarter volume declined 4% due to a 10% drop in premium traffic, which includes intermodal and automotive business.

Most of the intermodal decline was due to a 30% drop in international volume, which came down from record levels in 2024. Domestic intermodal volume had a record quarter and year, said Kenny Rocker, the railroad’s executive vice president of marketing and sales.

Bulk traffic, which includes coal, was up 3%, while industrial products traffic notched out a 1% quarterly gain.

Fourth-quarter operating income declined 5%, to $2.4 billion, as revenue declined 1%, to $6.08 billion. Earnings per share increased 7%, to $3.11. The railroad’s fourth-quarter operating ratio was 60.5%, a 1.8-point increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, as expenses increased 2%, to $3.68 billion.

Quarterly freight car velocity increased 9% to a record 239 car-miles per day. Average train speed was up 7%, while terminal dwell was down 9% to a record 19.8 hours. Average train length was a record, at 9,729 feet.

Eric Gehringer, executive vice president of operations, noted that the railroad had its lowest ever train accident and employee injury rates in 2025.

Chief Financial Officer Jennier Hamann says UP expects to hit the three-year financial targets outlined at its September 2024 investor day. For this year, UP forecasts earnings per share growth of around 5%, along with operating ratio improvement despite a muted economic outlook.

Rocker says UP has a positive outlook for coal, grain, and chemicals and plastics traffic this year. The railroad’s outlook is negative, however, for forest products, intermodal, and automotive.

UP’s $3.3 billion 2026 capital plan includes $1.9 on track maintenance, $600 million for capacity improvements and siding extensions, $400 million for locomotive modernizations, and $400 million for technology projects.

The January 18 disaster in the southern region of Andalusia -- one of Europe's deadliest such accidents this century -- partially shut the line linking Madrid and the city of Seville as investigators cleared the wreckage and collected evidence.

""Our aim is that it is completed in a timeframe of approximately 10 calendar days. After the replacement, the whole of the Madrid-Seville line will resume service,"" he added.
The line was Spain's first high-speed rail connection when it opened in 1992, with the network expanding to become the world's second-largest after China's and a source of national pride.
But the accident has raised doubts about the safety of rail travel in the country.
A preliminary report released last week suggested the track was cracked before a train run by private firm Iryo derailed and smashed into an oncoming service operated by state company Renfe.

The line was Spain's first high-speed rail connection when it opened in 1992, with the network expanding to become the world's second-largest after China's and a source of national pride.
But the accident has raised doubts about the safety of rail travel in the country.
A preliminary report released last week suggested the track was cracked before a train run by private firm Iryo derailed and smashed into an oncoming service operated by state company Renfe.

An inquiry into the derailment of a train in Aberdeenshire has heard the outcome would “more likely than not” have been better if the train had been built to modern safety standards.
The train crashed at Carmont near Stonehaven on August 12 2020 after it hit a pile of gravel washed onto the railway track by heavy rain before striking a bridge parapet.
Of the nine people who were aboard the train, three – train driver Brett McCullough, 45; conductor Donald Dinnie, 58; and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62 – were killed.
The fatal incident inquiry (FAI) at Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard on Wednesday that the train was made up of mark 3 high speed train (HST) coaches, which were built by British Rail in the 1970s.
Dominique Louis, a principal inspector at the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), told the inquiry the 50-year-old coaches lacked a number of safety features that are now standard in modern trains.
He told the inquiry: “The RAIB considers it more likely than not that the outcome would have been better if the train had been compliant with modern crashworthiness standards.”
Mr Louis said the coaches were built before the requirement for “anti-climb devices” – which prevent one coach riding over the top of another in the event of a crash – and “energy-absorbing vehicle ends” such as crumple zones.
Had these been in place, he said, they would have reduced the risk of coach D “overriding” the lead power car, which he said caused a “complete loss of survival space” that resulted in the death of Mr Dinnie.
He also said the “couplers” linking the coaches were together less capable than modern designs of withstanding the forces caused by the collision, which resulted in the train breaking up.
“All the vehicles became uncoupled except at the interface of coach A and the trailing power car,” Mr Louis said.
“That allowed the vehicle to scatter and roll over. That increased the risk of secondary impacts.”
Mr Louis also pointed out the coaches lacked devices to ensure they remained attached to their “bogies”, or wheeled chassis, which he said resulted in the five-tonne bogies being free to “slide and roll around in an uncontrolled manner”.
He explained: “Mark three coaches, unlike vehicles designed after 1994, are not fitted with any form of bogie retention in the vertical direction.

“This allowed the vehicle bodies to lift off their bogies during the derailment, and that’s how we ended up with so many bogies scattered around the accident site.”
Taken together, he said, “stronger couplers combined with anti-climbers and energy absorption structures” could have enabled coach D to keep the lead power car on track for long enough to make it over the bridge.
The inquiry also heard that corrosion had been found in a number of areas damaged in the crash, including around the base of pillars in coach D that were sheared off in the collision.
Mr Louis said metallurgical analysis found what should have been 5mm plates of steel had been reduced to 3-3.5mm, despite corrosion repairs having been made to the coach in 2019.
Mr Louis said: “It is undeniable that loss of material due to corrosion of the pillars would have weakened the body-end structure to some extent.”
However he added: “The investigation was not able to determine whether or not the original strength of the pillars would have been sufficient to prevent the loss of survival space that led to the death of the train’s conductor.”
The inquiry also heard evidence about the two fires that broke out following the collision, in the power car and in coach B, with RAIB inspector Mark Hamilton explaining that since nobody was trapped inside the train, they had not posed a risk to human life.
The FAI was previously told the death toll would have “almost certainly” been higher had the train been full on August 12 2020.
The crash took place during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Aberdeen area on lockdown, and there was a drop of around 65% in passenger numbers across the entire network at the time, the inquiry heard.

The crash, which occurred on January 18, is Spain’s deadliest train accident since 2013 and one of the highest death tolls from a rail disaster in recent European history. Families of those killed will receive 216,000 euros each within three months. The payment is split between 72,000 euros in tax-exempt government aid, 72,000 euros in advance insurance payouts, and 72,000 euros from mandatory travel insurance.
Puente emphasized the urgency of support, stating, “We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this. Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain.”
Payments to injured passengers will range from 2,400 euros to 84,000 euros, depending on the severity of their injuries.
The tragedy has intensified public scrutiny of Transport Minister Puente, with opposition parties, including the People’s Party, calling for his resignation following multiple railway incidents that same week. In Catalonia, a train driver died, and commuter rail services faced widespread disruption as drivers refused to operate over safety concerns, compounded by a software failure that shut down the Rodalies train traffic control center.
Puente defended his record, saying he had acted with a “calm conscience” and worked to keep citizens fully informed during the crisis.","Spain announced it will provide 20 million euros ($24 million) in compensation to victims of last week’s high-speed train crash near Adamuz, Cordoba, that killed 45 people and injured more than 150, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said Tuesday.

In Catalonia, a train driver died, and commuter rail services faced widespread disruption as drivers refused to operate over safety concerns, compounded by a software failure that shut down the Rodalies train traffic control center. Puente defended his record, saying he had acted with a “calm conscience” and worked to keep citizens fully informed during the crisis.",,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

The driver of a small snow plow has died after the vehicle was struck by a Metra Milwaukee District West train near the Bartlett station Monday morning.
Officials said an outbound train was approaching the Bartlett station when it struck what officials called a ""small, private snow plow."" around 8:35 a.m. Metra officials said no one on the train was injured.
Bartlett police said the snow plow driver, a 64-year-old Village of Bartlett Public Works employee, was injured and taken to St. Alexius Hospital where he later died. He has not yet been identified.
""It's really sad,"" said Thad Tobolte, who was a passenger on the train. ""One of the conductors said one of the village guys got killed. So I was stuck on the train for 40 minutes.""
Tobolte, who works in Bartlett, said he had seen the employee who was killed in the area before after getting off Metra.
""I waved to him once in a while,"" he said.
The small snow plow cold be seen hanging off the edge of the outbound platform after the crash. It was not clear if the plow was clearing snow from the platform at the time of the incident.
Bartlett Mayor Daniel Gunsteen released a statement after the employee's death, writing in part, ""We offer our comfort, prayers, and full support to the Public Works Department and all Village staff, who are understandably devastated and shaken by the loss of their colleague, friend, and valued member of their work family.""
He also offered his deepest condolences to the employee's wife, family and loved ones.
""On behalf of the entire Village of Bartlett, we mourn this profound loss and stand with his family and our Public Works team in their grief,"" the statement concluded.
Both inbound and outbound trains were affected for about half an hour before inbound train movement was restored, officials said. Outbound trains remain stopped and the train that struck the snow plow ill not operate past Bartlett.
Inbound and outbound train service is also suspended between Big Timber Road/Elgin and Bartlett due to the ongoing investigation. Riders should seek alternate transport if possible. Metra did not say when they expected that stretch of track to reopen.
Extensive delays are expected to continue. Riders can visit metra.com for the latest service alerts.

In a video message, Godoy said that when the train crashed, it was traveling at 65 kilometers per hour (km/h) on a curve where the maximum “authorized speed” is 50 km/h.

She said that the speed the train was traveling when it derailed in the state of Oaxaca on Dec. 28 was determined via information obtained from the black box, which was located in one of the train’s two locomotives.

In addition to the 14 fatalities, almost 100 people were injured in the crash, which occurred near the small Oaxaca town of Nizanda.

The driver of the train was arrested in Palenque, Chiapas, on Monday. He faces charges of culpable homicide and causing injuries due to his allegedly negligent driving.

Godoy said that the train was inspected after the accident and no defects that could have placed its operation at risk were found.

On stretches of railroad that the train passed before the accident occurred, it “reduced its speed, which allowed us to know that the braking system was working properly,” she said.

Godoy also said that no damage was found on the tracks.

She noted that a range of experts across fields, including topography, mechanical and electrical engineering, telecommunications and “industrial safety” contributed to the investigation carried out by the Federal Attorney General’s Office (FGR).

The attorney general said that investigations will continue to determine whether any other factors contributed to the accident, but as things stand, excessive speed has been established as the sole cause.

The train traveled at excessive speed during a period of more than 1 hour before the accident occurred

The Interoceanic Train was traveling across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, when the accident occurred.

Citing information obtained from the black box, Godoy said that the train, prior to the derailment, reached speeds of 111 km/h on straight stretches of railroad, 41 km/h above the “authorized limit.”

She said that the train rounded the six curves before the accident location at a speed of 52 km/h, slightly above the authorized limit.

Godoy stressed that “speeding on a train is much more dangerous than in a conventional vehicle” due to a train’s weight and mass as well as the radius of the curves it passes through. Consequently, she said, the “centrifugal force increases — that is the force that pushes the vehicle away from its center of rotation, which causes it to leave the tracks and overturn.”

The train that crashed on Dec. 28 — made up of two locomotives and four passenger cars — weighed approximately 400 tonnes and was transporting around 250 people.

Citing the investigation carried out by the FGR, the newspaper Reforma reported that the train traveled at excessive speed during a period of over an hour, but the driver wasn’t warned about his speeding or “stopped.”

“… Godoy didn’t say why, on the route [the train] covered before the accident — where there were two stops at stations — no alert or automated system was activated to make [the driver] reduce his speed,” Reforma wrote.

Carlos Barreda, a railroad expert, told Reforma that the trains that run on the interoceanic route have speed alert systems and speed control mechanisms. However, he questioned whether they were working.

The previous federal government modernized the railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as part of an ambitious trade corridor project. Former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador inaugurated the line in late 2023.

“Authorities, kings, politicians and rulers have been dreaming” about connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico for “centuries,” he said at the time.

Cargo unloaded at the ports in Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos can be transported across the isthmus by freight trains before being reloaded onto a ship to complete its journey to its final destination.

“It’s an exceptional project — it provides an alternative to the Panama Canal,” President Claudia Sheinbaum said in March 2025, referring to the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which includes the modernized railroad between Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos.

New faults on AVE and commuter lines add to the growing list of incidents across Spain's rail network

Spain's rail crisis continues as new incidents on commuter, medium-distance and high-speed lines add to ongoing disruption across the network, following the fatal train crash in Adamuz (Córdoba).

Since this tragic incident, where 45 people lost their lives and 152 people were injured, further incidents in Cartagena, Asturias and on the Rodalies network in Cataluña have raised serious concerns about the rail infrastructure. The incident in Rodiales claimed the life of one driver and left more than 30 injured. The latest issues show the scale of the problems with Spain's rail network.

Rodalies services in Cataluña are still struggling after the landslide in Gelida forced the network to shut down while train drivers called for safety checks. Services have started to resume, but further faults at the Centro de Tráfico Centralizado at Barcelona's Estació de França are causing repeated cancellations and delays.

Across the network, landslides, power failures and other infrastructure problems continue to cause disruption, with some services temporarily halted.

Protests have been threatened in Barcelona, warning that the ongoing chaos on Rodalies is hitting daily life and the local economy hard.

Delays and disruptions continue throughout Spain

Further disruption has been reported, this time in Bilbao, where some lines have been suspended due to a power outage. This latest incident happened at 8.15am on Tuesday January 27.

On the high-speed network, services between Madrid and Galicia continue to operate, although Renfe warns that journey times may be longer than usual due to recent adverse weather conditions. As a result, passengers are being offered free changes and refunds if they choose not to travel.

Adif maintains a temporary speed restriction of 160kmh on the Ourense-Santiago section of the line, which is expected to remain in place for around 48 hours. While high-speed trains continue to run, regional services in Galicia remain suspended due to the weather.

On the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed line, Adif confirms that the crack detected near l'Espluga de Francolí (Tarragona) has now been repaired. Following the repair, the maximum speed has been increased to 230 km/h, after having been reduced to 80 km/h as a precaution.

Issues persist on the Madrid-Sevilla high-speed line near Almodóvar del Río (Córdoba). Elsewhere in Andalucía, incidents on the medium-distance line between Córdoba and Jaén continue to affect services, with replacement buses operating between affected stations.

Rail workers in Mallorca are planning partial strikes, saying the service is underfunded, short-staffed and facing ongoing safety problems.

With investigations into the Adamuz crash and the incidents that followed still ongoing, Spain's rail network is under pressure. Passengers should make sure to check travel updates as the disruption continues.

ONTARIO, CA, (January 25, 2026) - A 43-year-old man tragically died Sunday morning in a train vs. pedestrian accident in Ontario, according to a coroner's press release from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.

Jamaal Scott died Sunday morning in a train vs. pedestrian accident near Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive in Ontario. Incident Location

The report says Jamaal Lionel Scott was hit by a train near Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive at approximately 10:49 a.m.

Sadly, Scott was declared dead at the scene.

Additional details were not initially released.

The Ontario Police Department is investigating.

FATAL PEDESTRIAN TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION Train accidents such as this can occur for several reasons, including train personnel error, train track failure, a mechanical error or malfunction, a signalman error, and reckless actions. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the crash site was made safe for the pedestrian crossing. According to the National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB), approximately 1,000 people are killed in train-related accidents each year. Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, said that in cases such as this that it is imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer as soon as possible to preserve evidence for a victim's family. “A skilled attorney can protect a grieving family from powerful train companies, which often send their investigators to crash sites and possess a variety of resources they can utilize to defend a negligent party,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal and national analyst for The Legal Advocate.

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM Pending results of the investigation, the family of Jamaal Scott may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of love and companionship, pain, suffering and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident. “The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand just what families are forced to go through, and having their rights protected is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that their legal rights and best interests are protected.”

The crash, which occurred on January 18, is Spain’s deadliest train accident since 2013 and one of the highest death tolls from a rail disaster in recent European history. Families of those killed will receive 216,000 euros each within three months. The payment is split between 72,000 euros in tax-exempt government aid, 72,000 euros in advance insurance payouts, and 72,000 euros from mandatory travel insurance.
Puente emphasized the urgency of support, stating, “We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this. Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain.”
Payments to injured passengers will range from 2,400 euros to 84,000 euros, depending on the severity of their injuries.
The tragedy has intensified public scrutiny of Transport Minister Puente, with opposition parties, including the People’s Party, calling for his resignation following multiple railway incidents that same week. In Catalonia, a train driver died, and commuter rail services faced widespread disruption as drivers refused to operate over safety concerns, compounded by a software failure that shut down the Rodalies train traffic control center.
Puente defended his record, saying he had acted with a “calm conscience” and worked to keep citizens fully informed during the crisis.","Spain announced it will provide 20 million euros ($24 million) in compensation to victims of last week’s high-speed train crash near Adamuz, Cordoba, that killed 45 people and injured more than 150, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said Tuesday.The crash, which occurred on January 18, is Spain’s deadliest train accident since 2013 and one of the highest death tolls from a rail disaster in recent European history.

NORTH BERWICK, Maine — The driver of a truck that crashed into a train on Thursday has been identified as Aiden Keefe, a senior at Noble High School, according to a letter sent out by the school's principal.

The letter was sent to the school community on the evening of the crash, which happened in North Berwick and involved an Amtrak Downeaster train. The principal extended condolences to Keefe's family, as well as a list of resources to help other students and teachers with the loss.

""Aiden was a valued member of the Noble school community, and he will be deeply missed...We know this is a difficult time for our community, and we will move through the day with care and compassion,"" the letter said

Students at the school reported that a moment of silence was held for their classmate on Friday morning and counseling services were available during the day. They also said the school is offering counseling services during the day and that Friday nights basketball game will be held in honor of Keefe.

Arriving crews found a badly damaged white truck beside the tracks where the train was fully stopped, North Berwick Police Chief Stephen Peasley said at the scene Thursday afternoon. Upon closer investigation, the driver of the truck was pronounced dead at the scene.

The train was traveling from Brunswick to Boston when it crashed into a vehicle around 2:30 p.m. at the intersection of Elm Street and Buffum Road. None of the 147 passengers and crew on train were injured, an Amtrak spokesperson told NEWS CENTER Maine.

Train 1T08 derailed at Carmont near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire on August 12, 2020 after it hit a pile of gravel washed on to the track by heavy rain, before striking a bridge parapet.

Of the nine people who were aboard the train, three: train driver Brett McCullough, 45; conductor Donald Dinnie, 58; and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62; were killed.

The fatal incident inquiry (FAI) at Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard on Thursday that a signaller had been following Network Rail’s rulebook when they instructed the driver to proceed at normal “line” speed just before the accident.

This was despite a once-in-a-century level of rainfall falling in eastern Scotland, which had seen a further landslip and three instances of flooding reported on lines within a few miles of the signal box.

The inquiry heard on Wednesday that the train, which was travelling from Aberdeen to Glasgow, had just passed what would become the crash site when the driver was told to stop and return to Stonehaven due to a landslip on the line ahead.

When the driver asked the signaller if there was any speed restriction in place, he was told it was “fine” to proceed at the line speed of 75pmh.

The train was travelling at about 73mph when it crashed a few minutes later.

Network Rail Scotland route director Ross Moran, who had been working as head of operations delivery at the time of the accident, told the inquiry on Thursday there was “no flexibility” around whether the rulebook was to be followed.

“The rulebook is the safety gospel as to how the network operates, and it’s predicated entirely on operating the network as safely as possible,” he said.

“In my opinion, the signaller on the day entirely complied with the rulebook.”

The inquiry is taking place at Aberdeen Sheriff Court (Andrew Milligan/PA) (Andrew Milligan)

Mr Moran said staff could ask permission to deviate from it if they felt it necessary, but in his roughly two decades working in the rail sector, he could not “personally recollect any scenario… where the rulebook has not been followed”.

In his evidence, Paul Ashton, who had been head of operations, principles and standards at the time of the crash, said Network Rail has since made substantial changes.

These include, he said, the way it monitors and responds to weather events, and its decision-making model.

He also said a clause has been added to the rulebook that “allows us to do things other than what’s prescribed in the rulebook, mainly if there’s a gap, or if applying the rule makes it less safe”.

Mr Moran was also asked about the day of the incident, which he said started with him waking between 5am and 6am with his phone buzzing with news of “multiple” incidents on the network due to the heavy rain.

The train was derailed after hitting gravel that had been washed onto the tracks by heavy rain (Ben Birchall/PA) (Ben Birchall)

He told the inquiry: “There were multiple incidents on the day affecting multiple lines and routes, so communication channels were under a good deal of pressure.

“It was possibly the busiest day I think I can ever recall in respect of incidents requiring to be managed.”

He said he travelled to the site of the accident in the afternoon in order to provide “welfare” support to some of his staff who were assisting at the scene, but said he did not have direct involvement with it.

Earlier, the inquiry heard evidence from Simon French, former chief inspector of rail accidents at the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB).

He told the inquiry that had Network Rail properly implemented the recommendations arising from previous “extreme weather” events on the railway, the incident at Carmont could have been avoided.

“Despite an awareness of the risk, Network Rail had not completed the implementation of additional control measures following previous events involving extreme weather and the management of operating incidents,” he said.

“It is possible that better delivery of change in response to safety learning would have resulted in actions that would have prevented, or mitigated, the consequences of the accident at Carmont.”

A criminal prosecution saw Network Rail fined £6.7 million in 2023 after it admitted health and safety failings over the crash.

A Network Rail spokesperson said on Monday the Government-owned company is “committed to supporting the work of the inquiry and continuing to deliver on the recommendations made by RAIB”.

He also said a clause has been added to the rulebook that “allows us to do things other than what’s prescribed in the rulebook, mainly if there’s a gap, or if applying the rule makes it less safe”.
Mr Moran was also asked about the day of the incident, which he said started with him waking between 5am and 6am with his phone buzzing with news of “multiple” incidents on the network due to the heavy rain.
He told the inquiry: “There were multiple incidents on the day affecting multiple lines and routes, so communication channels were under a good deal of pressure.
“It was possibly the busiest day I think I can ever recall in respect of incidents requiring to be managed.”
He said he travelled to the site of the accident in the afternoon in order to provide “welfare” support to some of his staff who were assisting at the scene, but said he did not have direct involvement with it.
Earlier, the inquiry heard evidence from Simon French, former chief inspector of rail accidents at the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB).
He told the inquiry that had Network Rail properly implemented the recommendations arising from previous “extreme weather” events on the railway, the incident at Carmont could have been avoided.
“Despite an awareness of the risk, Network Rail had not completed the implementation of additional control measures following previous events involving extreme weather and the management of operating incidents,” he said.
“It is possible that better delivery of change in response to safety learning would have resulted in actions that would have prevented, or mitigated, the consequences of the accident at Carmont.”
A criminal prosecution saw Network Rail fined £6.7 million in 2023 after it admitted health and safety failings over the crash.
A Network Rail spokesperson said on Monday the Government-owned company is “committed to supporting the work of the inquiry and continuing to deliver on the recommendations made by RAIB”.
They added: “We’ve made significant changes to how we manage the risk of severe weather since the accident and our work to make our network more resilient will continue.”

The Incident in Santa Monica

According to Waymo's official statement, the collision occurred on Friday, 23 January, in Santa Monica. The company reported that a young pedestrian 'suddenly entered the roadway' from behind a large, stationary SUV, stepping directly into the path of the oncoming robotaxi.

Waymo's data indicates that the autonomous vehicle's sensors detected the individual the moment they emerged from behind the visual obstruction. The vehicle, marketed as the 'Waymo Driver', reportedly executed an emergency braking manoeuvre, decelerating from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph at the moment of impact.

'Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately (and) walked to the sidewalk,' the company wrote in its transparency update. Emergency services were called to the scene, and the vehicle remained stationary until cleared by law enforcement.

The current medical condition of the child has not been publicly released beyond the detail that they were able to walk away from the collision.

AI vs. Human: The Safety Defence

In a move to defend the efficacy of its autonomous systems, Waymo released comparative data suggesting a human driver would have caused greater harm in the same scenario. The company cited its own peer-reviewed modelling, which calculated that a 'fully attentive human driver' would likely have struck the child at approximately 14 mph—more than double the speed at which the robotaxi made contact.

'This significant reduction in impact speed and severity is a demonstration of the material safety benefit of the Waymo Driver,' the blog entry asserted. This 'gap' between human reaction time and AI processing speed is central to the industry's argument that self-driving cars are safer than their human counterparts, despite high-profile accidents.

Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies

The collision has triggered immediate federal attention. Waymo confirmed it voluntarily reported the incident to the NHTSA on the day it occurred. The federal regulator has since indicated it will open a probe into the crash.

This investigation adds to the growing scrutiny of autonomous vehicle operators in the United States, following a series of incidents involving rival companies such as Cruise and Tesla.

While Waymo has generally maintained a stronger safety record than some competitors, this event underscores the persistent challenges autonomous vehicles face in unpredictable urban environments, particularly involving vulnerable road users like children. The company reiterated its 'commitment to transparency' and promised full cooperation with federal investigators as the inquiry proceeds.","Waymo Admits One of Their Robotaxi's Hit a Child in California, Says Accident Could've Been Worse

Legal Insights on Train Crash Investigations
In cases such as this, conducting an independent investigation promptly is crucial to preserve evidence for affected families. National legal analysts emphasize the importance of thorough reviews to counter potential defenses from rail operators.
“A skilled attorney can protect a grieving family from powerful train companies, which often send their investigators to crash sites and possess a variety of resources they can utilize to defend a negligent party,” said Candice Bond, managing partner of Bond Legal. “Time is of the essence in cases such as this, and the victim must ensure that evidence is reviewed efficiently.”
- Independent investigations help secure vital evidence before it degrades.
- Rail companies may deploy extensive resources to limit liability.
- Early legal involvement safeguards family interests in complex cases.
Potential Wrongful Death Claims in Train Accidents
Families of victims in train collisions may pursue wrongful death claims to seek compensation for loss of companionship, pain, suffering, and emotional distress. These claims address the profound effects of such tragedies.
“The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, of counsel with Bond Legal. “A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help ensure that the victim's legal rights and best interests are protected.”

NJ Transit investigating after pedestrian fatally hit by Raritan Valley Line train

UNION, NJ, (January 26, 2026) - A 55-year-old man tragically died Monday afternoon in a train vs. pedestrian accident in Union County.

Anthony Lewis was hit by a Raritan Valley Line train and fatally injured Monday afternoon at the Plainfield Station in Union County. Incident Location

According to NJ Transit Police, a westbound Raritan Valley Line train hit 55-year-old Anthony Lewis near the Plainfield Station around 2:11 p.m.

Lewis was rushed to a local hospital, where he sadly passed away.

Authorities say the train had departed Newark Penn Station earlier in the day.

The incident remains under investigation.

CRASH INVESTIGATION NEEDED According to the National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB), approximately 1,000 people are killed in train-related accidents each year. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the area where Lewis was hit was made safe for pedestrians. While the cause and liability of the crash are being investigated, Andrew G. Finkelstein, Managing Partner at Jacoby & Meyers Law Offices, said it is important that a competent attorney handles investigations into cases such as this to protect the rights of the victim's family. Well-known lawyers such as Finkelstein, experienced in train-related accidents, can help protect your rights by guiding you through every step of the process. ""Serious accidents involving motor vehicles can bring physical, financial, and emotional trauma upon a victim. The results are more catastrophic when a train, commercial truck, or other large vehicle is involved. Experienced attorneys familiar with such situations know ways to protect your rights and pursue compensation.""

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM Pending the investigation, the family members of Anthony Lewis may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of companionship, pain and suffering, and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident such as this incident. ""People who get into a train accident suffer unimaginable consequences in the form of mental and physical pain, and, in cases of fatalities, the victim's family and loved ones are left devastated,"" added Finkelstein. ""It is always recommended that, as a victim, you don't give statements right away after the crash to an insurance company."" ""You might be in shock, and anything said at the time may lower the chances of getting justice. Hiring an attorney will be the best route to protect your rights,"" added Finkelstein.

WOODRIDGE, IL, January 26, 2026 – A Bartlett Public Works employee was killed Monday morning after the snowplow vehicle he was operating was struck by a Metra train in Bartlett, according to the Metra Police Department.

TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Recent federal data shows that railroad-related incidents in the United States result in approximately 950 deaths and more than 6,500 injuries each year. These incidents include train-pedestrian collisions, trespassing events, employee injuries, passenger incidents, and highway-rail grade-crossing crashes.

Train and rail accidents can occur for a variety of reasons, including human error, track defects, mechanical malfunctions, signal or communication failures, and unauthorized access to rail corridors.

All of these factors will be evaluated as part of the investigation. Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, noted that in cases like this, an independent investigation by a seasoned lawyer can be essential to protecting a victim’s family.

“Train crashes are often complex, with multiple potential contributing factors,” said Bond, managing partner of Bond Legal. “A knowledgeable attorney can help shield families from powerful rail companies that deploy their own investigators and resources. By retaining expert witnesses, locating witnesses, reviewing insurance coverage, and guiding families through the legal process, an attorney works to safeguard their rights and interests.”

But pride alone doesn’t ensure safety | María Ramírez - The Guardian,np_html,tf_html,rd_html,gs_html,"Spain has the most extensive high-speed rail network in Europe and the second-largest in the world after China. A source of immense national pride, the train system has grown and become more affordable thanks to a boom in rail passengers and competition among train companies. Every few minutes, a train departs from Madrid for Barcelona and vice versa, linking the country’s two most populous cities. This 600km journey takes less than three hours for an average fare of €65.

Thirty-four years after the first high-speed train between Madrid and Seville, the network now connects more than 50 cities in Spain. Along with being a badge of pride for the country, it even commands a rare political consensus. At least that was the case until this month’s calamities. In the first accident, one train derailed and collided with another near the town of Adamuz in Andalucía, killing 45 people and leaving dozens more injured. A second accident in Catalonia, caused by the collapse of a wall in bad weather, killed the driver of a commuter train in Barcelona. The local network, which has suffered delays and malfunctions for years, was completely halted for days as a result.

The network’s safety record remains strong, but these shocks have sparked debate on underinvestment in infrastructure maintenance and become yet another issue for angry, partisan conflict.

Spaniards love trains. Travel by train now accounts for more than 56% of all transport, surpassing road and air transport combined. In 2024, long-distance trains carried 85 million passengers a 15% increase on the previous year. The shock of what happened hits closer to home since trains are such an integral part of daily life and continue to provide a reliable service for many across the country (even if local networks remain a source of frustration and the most depopulated areas have gradually lost their services over the years).

The investigation into the Andalucía derailment is ongoing but the focus of inquiries is on the point where the accident happened, specifically on a broken weld connecting two rails, one from 1989 and one from 2023. There is now political disagreement over the extent to which the infrastructure on the Madrid-Seville line, among the oldest in the high-speed network, had been overhauled.

The minister for transport, Óscar Puente, a divisive figure who often takes to social media to criticise journalists and political rivals, acknowledged that he was mistaken on some of the details in his first statements on the crash.

The centre-right People’s party (PP) is using the dispute to mount a broader attack on the government. Party leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo even made a pun comparing the state of the railway with the state of the nation.

The PP-led regional government in Valencia was widely criticised for mismanaging the floods in the area in 2024, and its president was forced to resign a year later. Now many in the PP are pushing to blame the Socialist-led national government for the train disaster. Only a few conservative officials, such as the president of Andalucía, have refrained from exploiting the tragedy for political point scoring.

Despite the blame game, the truth is that the high-speed network has been the result of a long-term commitment by politicians across the political spectrum. But prioritising investment in new lines over the maintenance of existing infrastructure has been a persistent pattern too. Regardless of party affiliation, politicians tend to like inaugurating a new line or a renovated train station. There are few photo opportunities to be had and little kudos attached to the boring but vital task of upgrading tracks in the middle of the countryside.

The centre-left government has invested more in rails and maintenance than the previous conservative administration, which ran the country in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Still, with growing traffic, new lines and more passengers, Spain spends less on maintenance per kilometre than Germany or Switzerland, even if such comparisons are imperfect given differences in network age and the cost of public works and materials.

Moving forward requires a serious, careful approach for both the government and the opposition, not another partisan, unscrupulous race to the bottom for political gain.

And yes, there is still a lot to love about trains in Spain. They are cheaper, faster and more comfortable than most in Europe.","Spain has the most extensive high-speed rail network in Europe and the second-largest in the world after China.

SILVERTHORNE, Colo. (KKCO/Gray News) — One person was killed and several others were hospitalized Thursday after a snowplow truck struck a van carrying a girls’ hockey team, according to police in Colorado.
State police said the collision happened near Silverthorne at about 8:50 a.m. when a Colorado Department of Transportation snowplow driver lost control on Interstate 70 and crashed through the median into a Toyota Tacoma. The plow then crashed into the sprinter van carrying the hockey team, knocking it down an embankment.
The Tacoma also collided with a BMW, crash investigators said.
Colorado State Patrol said the driver of the sprinter van died at the scene.
The Clear Creek County coroner will publicly identify the driver once notifications are made.
At least seven passengers from the sprinter van, including five who are under 18, were taken to a local hospital, according to state police. One of the young passengers was transported by helicopter.
The youth hockey group was identified as the SC Flyers, a girls’ team from Santa Clarita, California.
“Words cannot express the heartbreak we are experiencing,” a team official said in a statement online.
According to the team’s website, the players were scheduled for a game at the Edge Ice Arena in Littleton, Colorado, on Friday morning.
Both lanes of I-70 were reopened Thursday afternoon.

(Gray News) – A child was hit by a driverless car near an elementary school in California last week during school drop-off hours.

According to an investigation report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were other children, a crossing guard and several double-parked vehicles in the area at the time of the accident.

Officials said the child ran across the street from behind a double-parked SUV toward the school and was hit by the Waymo AV.

The child sustained minor injuries and is expected to be OK.

According to Waymo, the child stood up immediately after the accident and walked to the sidewalk.

Waymo said in a blog statement that it called 911, and the vehicle moved to the side of the road and waited until law enforcement arrived and cleared the scene.

“Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made,” Waymo said.

At the time of the incident, the Waymo AV was operated by Waymo’s fifth-generation automated driving system, the NHTSA investigation report said. No safety operator was present in the vehicle.

The NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is looking into whether Waymo exercised appropriate caution given its proximity to the elementary school during drop-off hours and the presence of young children.

ODI will also investigate Waymo’s post-impact response.

The January 18 disaster in the southern region of Andalusia -- one of Europe's deadliest such accidents this century -- partially shut the line linking Madrid and the city of Seville as investigators cleared the wreckage and collected evidence.
""Today we have received legal permission to proceed with the replacement of the infrastructure in the section of the accident,"" Transport Minister Oscar Puente wrote on X.
""Our aim is that it is completed in a timeframe of approximately 10 calendar days. After the replacement, the whole of the Madrid-Seville line will resume service,"" he added.

GLENDALE, Calif. (KABC) -- A pregnant woman was killed Wednesday morning in a violent collision involving a Metrolink train and a car at a crossing in Glendale.

The crash was reported shortly after 9 a.m. on Brazil Street, just west of the intersection of San Fernando Road and Broadway, between the Burbank Downtown and the Glendale stations, according to Metrolink.

The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to the Glendale Police Department, the sedan was traveling northbound on West San Fernando Road when the driver attempted to make a right turn onto Broadway, which turns into Brazil Street at that point.

""As the vehicle entered the crossing, it was struck by a Metrolink train traveling on the tracks,"" police said in a statement.

The downtown L.A.-bound train, number 206 on the Antelope Valley Line, was stopped on the tracks for hours after the collision.

A male pedestrian who was in the immediate area was struck by an object as a result of debris from the collision, police said. He was transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

""There are approximately 150 passengers on train 206, though no injuries have been reported aboard at this time,"" Metrolink said in a statement issued shortly after 10 a.m.

Trains 207 and 208 on the Antelope Valley Line were canceled, as were trains 320 and 341 on the San Bernardino Line. Metro buses were used to shuttle passengers between the Burbank Downtown and Glendale stations.

According to the Glendale Police Department, the sedan was traveling northbound on West San Fernando Road when the driver attempted to make a right turn onto Broadway, which turns into Brazil Street at that point.

""As the vehicle entered the crossing, it was struck by a Metrolink train traveling on the tracks,"" police said in a statement.

The downtown L.A.-bound train, number 206 on the Antelope Valley Line, was stopped on the tracks for hours after the collision.

A male pedestrian who was in the immediate area was struck by an object as a result of debris from the collision, police said. He was transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

""There are approximately 150 passengers on train 206, though no injuries have been reported aboard at this time,"" Metrolink said in a statement issued shortly after 10 a.m.

Trains 207 and 208 on the Antelope Valley Line were canceled, as were trains 320 and 341 on the San Bernardino Line. Metro buses were used to shuttle passengers between the Burbank Downtown and Glendale stations.

MADRID (AP) — Multiple train crashes this week have rocked Spain, with the tragedies leading to questions about safety on the country’s vast railway system.

The first crash involved a high-speed train in southern Spain that derailed on Sunday evening, colliding with another fast train, killing at least 45 people and injuring more than 150.

The crash was the deadliest in Spain since a 2013 crash that killed 80 people when a commuter train in the northern region of Galicia hurtled off the rails as it came around a bend going too fast.

On Tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern Spain on a commuter line near Barcelona. One person was killed.

Then, on Thursday, a commuter train crashed in southeastern Spain, slightly injuring six passengers.

Here’s what to know.

The Sunday derailment happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails and slammed into an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva with around 200 people, according to rail operator Adif.

The head of the second train took the brunt of the impact, Transport Minister Óscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a four-meter (13-foot) slope. The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid.

“The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away,” Andalusia regional President Juan Manuel Moreno said.

Authorities said they had identified almost all the victims from Sunday’s crash.

Explanations about what caused the crash were scant, with an official investigation underway, but some details have started to emerge.

Spain’s rail accident investigating body CIAF said Friday that a fracture in the rail appeared to have been present before the high-speed train derailment that killed at least 45 people. In a preliminary report, the body said that investigators found uniform notches on several of the wheel treads on the right-hand side of the train that jumped the track, according to the report.

What caused the apparent fracture isn’t known, investigators said, not ruling out any possibilities.

“These nicks in the wheels and the deformation observed in the rail are consistent with the rail being fractured,” the report said.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of national railway company, Renfe, has said that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph) and “human error could be ruled out.”

The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, belonged to Renfe.

Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15.

The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers sent a letter last August asking Spain’s rail operator to investigate flaws on high-speed train lines across the country caused by increased traffic.

It warned of potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines, as well as frequent breakdowns and damage to trains, according to a copy of the letter seen by The Associated Press.

The union called for a general strike in the coming weeks to demand more safety assurances.

Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains traveling more than 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.

The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Officials said that Sunday’s collision was the first with deaths on Spain’s high-speed rail network since it opened its first line in 1992.

A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 37 others.

A commuter train crashed on Thursday in the southeastern Murcia region after it collided with a crane. Emergency services said six people with minor injuries had been transferred to the hospital.

While Spain’s high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, commuter rails are plagued by reliability issues. However, crashes causing injury or death aren’t common.","Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.

However, crashes causing injury or death aren’t common.","MADRID (AP) — Multiple train crashes this week have rocked Spain, with the tragedies leading to questions about safety on the country’s vast railway system. The first crash involved a high-speed train in southern Spain that derailed on Sunday evening, colliding with another fast train, killing at least 45 people and injuring more than 150. The crash was the deadliest in Spain since a 2013 crash that killed 80 people when a commuter train in the northern region of Galicia hurtled off the rails as it came around a bend going too fast.On Tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern Spain on a commuter line near Barcelona. One person was killed.Then, on Thursday, a commuter train crashed in southeastern Spain, slightly injuring six passengers. 
Here’s what to know.
Derailment and collision The Sunday derailment happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails and slammed into an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva with around 200 people, according to rail operator Adif.The head of the second train took the brunt of the impact, Transport Minister Óscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a four-meter (13-foot) slope. The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid.
“The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away,” Andalusia regional President Juan Manuel Moreno said.Authorities said they had identified almost all the victims from Sunday’s crash.
Cause under investigationExplanations about what caused the crash were scant, with an official investigation underway, but some details have started to emerge.Spain’s rail accident investigating body CIAF said Friday that a fracture in the rail appeared to have been present before the high-speed train derailment that killed at least 45 people. In a preliminary report, the body said that investigators found uniform notches on several of the wheel treads on the right-hand side of the train that jumped the track, according to the report. 
What caused the apparent fracture isn’t known, investigators said, not ruling out any possibilities.“These nicks in the wheels and the deformation observed in the rail are consistent with the rail being fractured,” the report said.Álvaro Fernández, the president of national railway company, Renfe, has said that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph) and “human error could be ruled out.”The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, belonged to Renfe.Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15. The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers sent a letter last August asking Spain’s rail operator to investigate flaws on high-speed train lines across the country caused by increased traffic. 
It warned of potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines, as well as frequent breakdowns and damage to trains, according to a copy of the letter seen by The Associated Press.The union called for a general strike in the coming weeks to demand more safety assurances.High-speed expansionSpain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains traveling more than 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport.

The crash involved a Metrolink train that was traveling from the Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles at around 9 a.m. on Feb. 4, in Glendale, Calif.

A driver was attempting to make a turn from the city's West San Fernando Road onto Broadway when the car was struck by an oncoming train

A pregnant woman was killed, and four others were injured after a train slammed into a car that was crossing the tracks in California.

According to police in Glendale, Calif., a city bordering Los Angeles, the crash involved a Metrolink train that was traveling from the Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles at around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 4.

Police said that a driver attempted to make a turn from the city's West San Fernando Road onto Broadway, crossing the railroad tracks.

As the car entered the railroad crossing, it was hit by Metrolink train 206, police wrote in a statement shared to Facebook.

Police and fire personnel were called to the scene, and the driver, identified as 35-year-old Zukhra Kurbanova, by authorities and FOX Los Angeles, was pronounced dead at the scene.

ABC7 and KTLA reported after the crash that Kurbanova was pregnant.

Additionally, police said that a man walking nearby was struck by debris. His injuries were not life-threatening, and he was taken to a local hospital.

Metrolink told the outlets that three passengers aboard the train also reported injuries, including one person who was hospitalized and two who were treated by emergency personnel on the train.

Footage from the local news outlets showed fire and police officials at the scene as the car, a silver sedan, sat on the tracks as the railroad's safety arms were down. The vehicle was heavily damaged, and its airbags were deployed.



""There are approximately 150 passengers on train 206, though no injuries have been reported aboard at this time,"" the rail operator told ABC7 in a statement.

The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office told PEOPLE that the decedent was a resident of Glendale, and an exam has been scheduled.



When reached for comment, the Glendale Police Department said they could not release the identity of the deceased until the coroner's office's part of the investigation was complete.

""Additionally, this complex investigation will require some more time and our traffic investigator’s opinion as to why will be deferred until then,"" they added. ""We do have knowledge that the arms at the tracks were in fact operational and operating at the time the driver made the right turn.""

A California congressman is calling for more railroad oversight. It comes on the three-year anniversary of one of the nation's most destructive railway accidents and just a day after a derailment in Stockton.
Most of the 17,000 Pacific Gas and Electric customers now have power restored following Monday's train accident in the Stockton railyards. But that mishap highlights the impact a train derailment can have on nearby communities.
""Millions of Americans live and work along hazmat railways,"" said Ed Kelly, general president of the International Association of Firefighters. ""We need to protect them.""
This week marks the three-year anniversary of the fire and explosion in East Palestine, Ohio, that was caused by a train derailment.
Congressman John Garamendi says similar tanker cars carrying flammable chemicals regularly come through Davis, Sacramento, and other Northern California communities.
""And we've had our share of almost-serious accidents,"" Garamendi said.
He is co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would require new railroad safety standards.
""This rail safety bill covers sensible things,"" Garamendi said. ""It's not complex, but it is very, very important.""
It would mandate having at least two crew members on board trains. It also requires railroads to install defect detectors that can spot mechanical problems, and it would force railroads to fund more hazmat training for first responders.
""Too often, firefighters arrive at train derailments with limited information and limited training,"" Kelly said.
Penalties for safety violations would also be increased.
The Association of American Railroads says there's no proven safety benefit to justify the cost of requiring two crew members. They oppose these kinds of regulations and want to adopt modern technologies to enhance safety benefits.
But bill supporters say more work needs to be done to protect communities from any more railway disasters.
The authors of the bill are trying to get it included in a vote for the new federal surface transportation reauthorization act.","A California congressman is calling for more railroad oversight.

Family, friends, and coworkers are mourning the loss of 22-year-old Elinor Steffy, who was identified by loved ones as the person killed after being hit by a car at a Folsom SacRT light rail station last week.“Elinor, we just watched her grow up,” said Sam Pickering Pick, who shared he’d known Steffy as a small child. “Any time you hear about somebody that you knew well who is just gone is—it's hard. Hard to believe. Hard to understand it.”Pickering Pick and his wife placed flowers at the train station on Monday.The deadly crash occurred at the Iron Point station on Thursday, Jan. 22, just before 3 p.m. SacRT said a vehicle struck the ramp at the station and overturned onto the tracks. Folsom police said a pedestrian was killed in the crash. Loved ones identified her as Steffy.""I wish everybody could know what sort of a girl she was,"" Pickering Pick said. ""The girl that I knew, that my family knew was, had so much life, so much left to give. It's just unbelievable."" According to an online fundraiser, Steffy was on her way to work as a dance instructor last Thursday at the nearby Hawkins School of Performing Arts.""It is with heavy hearts that we share the passing of Elinor Steffy. She was deeply loved and will always be cherished by her Hawkins family, and her presence will be profoundly missed by all who knew her,"" the school posted in a social media statement.“She's a big dancer. That's her whole life. It was what she was meant to do,” said Trinity Maxon, a friend of Steffy’s. “She was dancing on and off the dance floor. Always dancing.""Maxon shared she’d met Steff through friends who enjoyed listening to music and going dancing together at Sacramento’s Torch Club. She said Steffy was the kind of person you could befriend in an instant. “Elinor was the best person you would have ever met, and she would have been your best friend. She would have made you feel like the most confident person in the room,” Maxon said.According to Folsom Police, fatal collision investigations can take several months to complete. A spokesperson said, as of Monday, there was no determined cause of the crash and alcohol is not suspected to have been a factor.A fundraiser is now underway to establish a nonprofit in Steffy's name, aimed at bringing dance education and workshops to Sacramento-area young people, the next generation of dancers. ""I just want her legacy to be known,” Maxon said. “Not just being the star of the show, but also for the caring person that she was and the things that she would do for her community and for her family.”See more coverage of top California stories here | Download our app | Subscribe to our morning newsletter | Find us on YouTube here and subscribe to our channel",tf_html,rd_html,"HOW THEY HOPE SHE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT GENERATIONS TO COME.

""The important thing is that there was no derailment,"" said Fernando López Miras, the president of the Murcia region, in the translated social media post

Three previous train incidents occurred in Spain, including the deadly one in Adamuz on Jan. 18

Authorities in Spain said at least six people sustained minor injuries following a collision between a commuter train and a crane arm, marking the fourth rail incident in the country in less than a week.

The latest incident occurred on Thursday, Jan. 22, near the port city of Cartagena in the region of Murcia, Reuters, Sky News and Spanish news outlet 20 Minutos reported.

Óscar Puente, Spain’s transport minister, said in a translated social media post that a crane's arm extended into a railway and struck the windows of a narrow-gauge train that was passing at the time.

Emergency services and Fernando López Miras, the president of the Murcia region, confirmed the injuries and noted that the train didn't derail in a statement shared online.

""A small collision between a crane arm and a FEVE train is what caused the incident in Cartagena. The important thing is that there was no derailment, and the six people with minor injuries, to whom I wish a speedy recovery, have already been treated,"" Miras said in the translated caption.

The collision in Murcia is the fourth incident within a week involving Spain’s rail service, as the country was in mourning from the deadly high-speed train derailment-collision disaster earlier this week.

On Jan. 18, at 7:45 p.m. local time, the Iryo train heading to Madrid from Málaga was approaching the Adamuz train station when its last two cars derailed, according to a preliminary report from the transport ministry.

The derailed cars then swerved into the path of the Renfe Alvia train traveling in the opposite direction. The impact caused the two front cars of the Alvia train to fall down a 13-foot embankment.

At the time of the collision, the Iryo carried 289 passengers, and the Alvia contained 184 people, according to the Associated Press.

As of Friday, Jan. 23, the transport ministry reported that the death toll from Sunday’s incident is 45, with 29 serious injuries and 123 minor injuries.

Two days after the initial incident, a Rodalies train was near Gelida station, about 20 miles northwest of Barcelona in the Catalonia region, when it struck segments of a retaining wall that had collapsed onto the track, the transport ministry's preliminary report said.

One trainee conductor died, according to officials. He was identified as 27-year-old Fernando Huerta from Seville, The Guardian reported.

Man Killed After Being Struck by Brightline Train in Deerfield Beach; Investigation Ongoing
Authorities are investigating a fatal train-pedestrian collision after a man was struck and killed by a Brightline train Monday night in Deerfield Beach, according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office (BSO).
BSO officials said the incident occurred around 9:20 p.m. near the intersection of West Hillsboro Boulevard and Dixie Highway. Investigators reported that the man was attempting to cross the east set of railroad tracks when he was struck by the oncoming Brightline train.
The man was pronounced dead at the scene. His identity has not yet been released. Officials stated that, at the time of the investigation, railroad safety equipment was functioning properly. Traffic homicide detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Collisions involving trains are almost always catastrophic due to the size, speed, and stopping limitations of rail vehicles. Brightline trains travel at high speeds through urban and suburban areas of South Florida, leaving little margin for error for pedestrians near the tracks.
Common factors examined in train-pedestrian fatalities include:
- Visibility and lighting conditions
- Warning signals, gates, and signage
- Train speed and horn usage
- Pedestrian access points and fencing
- Whether crossings were designated or unauthorized
Even when safety equipment is operational, questions may still arise regarding track access, pedestrian controls, and overall rail corridor safety—particularly in densely populated areas.
Legal Options After a Fatal Train Accident in Florida
When a train-related incident results in death, surviving family members may have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim under Florida’s Wrongful Death Act (Florida Statutes §§768.16–768.26).
In Florida, wrongful death claims are brought by the personal representative of the deceased person’s estate on behalf of surviving family members, which may include a spouse, children, or parents.
Depending on the circumstances, recoverable damages may include:
- Funeral and burial expenses
- Medical expenses related to the fatal injury
- Loss of financial support and services
- Loss of companionship, guidance, and protection
- Mental pain and suffering of surviving family members

Daily Post Correspondent

Palo Alto community members are urging City Council to close the intersection where Churchill Avenue intersects with the railroad tracks after a Caltrain hit and killed 17-year-old Summer Devi Mehta last Tuesday.

In a letter to the City Council Nick Mehta, Summer’s father, said he supports closing the intersection, believing Churchill provided an “easy means for her to impulsively act at a low moment.”

The letter was read by a friend of Nick Mehta’s during tonight’s council meeting.

The Caltrain crossing at Churchill Avenue and Alma Street is adjacent to Palo Alto High School, and has been the site of multiple student suicides over the past few years.

“It is too late for my daughter but it is not too late for others,” Nick Mehta wrote.

In response, Mayor Vicki Veenker said tonight that an The Rail Safety/Youth Mental Health ad hoc committee has been created to look into ramping up safety measures at the intersection, and the logistics of shutting it down, an action that Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin urged the council to do in a Thursday letter.

The committee consists of council members Julie Lythcott-Haims, Pat Burt and Greer Stone.

Lythcott-Haims said the committee has already met with Caltrain and other city transportation safety officials to explore their options, which included talks about installing more high-tech cameras that can detect unusual movements on the tracks and paying security guards to monitor the intersection. The committee will meet again this week, Lythcott-Haims said.

But several residents said they also want council to shut the Churchill crossing immediately, and not wait for the committee’s insights and recommendation.

A resident who identified herself as Bre. T said her daughter was Summer’s friend and is “begging” the council to close the intersection.

“Failing to close is a complacency I just can’t tolerate as a mom anymore,” she said.

Prior to the ad hoc meeting, Caltrain and Palo Alto were working on installing new technologies at Churchill crossings to improve safety, including using AI to help detect and alert officials about lingering cars and pedestrians on the tracks. Other potential updates include a partial underpass to reduce car and pedestrian traffic and grade separation, which would require temporarily closing the crossing.","BY STEPHANIE LAM

The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation.","Spanish train drivers to begin nationwide strike after fatal crashes
Train drivers in Spain are due to begin a three-day nationwide strike on Monday in protest of what they say is a lack of safety guarantees on the country's rail system.
The action follows two fatal train crashes in January, one in Adamuz in the country's southern region which killed 46 people, and the second just two days later near Barcelona where a train driver died and dozens were injured.
The accidents have caused severe disruption for travellers and cast doubt on Spain's much-vaunted rail system.
Semaf, the train drivers' union, are demanding the hiring of more staff and increased investment and maintenance in what it has described as ""the constant deterioration of the rail network"".
Following the two collisions, subsequent safety checks also revealed faults and maintenance issues on a number of routes.
Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to be grilled in parliament later this week about the failures in the rail system.
The accident in Adamuz on 18 January, where a high-speed train derailed and collided with another travelling in the opposite direction was the country's worst rail disaster in more than a decade.
A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the train went over it.
Just two days later in Catalonia, a trainee driver was killed and at least 37 passengers were injured when a collapsed wall caused another local train to derail.
Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing, striking the driver's cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling.
Semaf has previously said the collisions represent ""a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations"".
The amount of investment the rail network receives has come under particular scrutiny. The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation.
""We're not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we're not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we're not looking at a problem of lack of investment,"" said Transport Minister Óscar Puente.","""We're not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we're not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we're not looking at a problem of lack of investment,"" said Transport Minister Óscar Puente.","Train drivers in Spain are due to begin a three-day nationwide strike on Monday in protest of what they say is a lack of safety guarantees on the country's rail system.

The action follows two fatal train crashes in January, one in Adamuz in the country's southern region which killed 46 people, and the second just two days later near Barcelona where a train driver died and dozens were injured.

Semaf, the train drivers' union, are demanding the hiring of more staff and increased investment and maintenance in what it has described as ""the constant deterioration of the rail network"".

The accident in Adamuz on 18 January, where a high-speed train derailed and collided with another travelling in the opposite direction was the country's worst rail disaster in more than a decade.

A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the train went over it.

Just two days later in Catalonia, a trainee driver was killed and at least 37 passengers were injured when a collapsed wall caused another local train to derail.

The death toll from Sunday’s collision between two trains near the Andalucían town of Adamuz rose from 43 to 45 on Thursday afternoon after two more bodies were recovered from the crash site. On Tuesday, a driver was killed and 37 people injured when a train was derailed by the collapse of a retaining wall near Gelida in Catalonia.

A number of people were also lightly injured on Thursday when a commuter train in the south-eastern region of Murcia crashed into a crane. Authorities said the incident was caused by “the intrusion … of a crane not belonging to the railway operation”, and the train was not derailed or overturned.

The accidents in Adamuz and Gelida led the Spanish railway drivers’ union Semaf to announce industrial action. They have also prompted a stoppage by drivers that has shut down Catalonia’s regional rail services, affecting about 400,000 travellers.

The union said three days of strikes would be held from 9 to 11 February, saying the action was “the only legal avenue left for workers to demand the restoration of safety standards on the railway system and, consequently, guarantee the safety of both railway professionals and passengers”.

Semaf called for the relevant authorities to ensure people’s safety by addressing the “numerous reports” on poor track conditions it said had gone “unanswered and inactive for months, or even years”.

It added: “The serious accidents in Adamuz and Gelida, both of which resulted in people losing their lives, represent a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations.”

Spain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente, said he understood drivers’ concerns but hoped the strikes could be averted, and he said the stoppage in Catalonia needed to end. He has stressed that the two accidents were “completely unrelated”. The Gelida incident is thought to have been caused by heavy rainfall.

“This is a very difficult week,” he told Catalunya Ràdio on Thursday morning. “We need to remain calm and get this where it needs to be. Two terrible incidents have occurred in a very short space of time, and I believe that is significantly impacting the morale of the train drivers. I hope the situation will be resolved soon.”

Investigators are continuing to examine the crash site in Adamuz and the wreckage of the two trains. The accident happened at 7.40pm on Sunday when a high-speed train travelling from Málaga to Madrid derailed, crossing on to another track where it hit an oncoming train travelling from Madrid to Huelva.

Media reports suggest investigators are focusing on a 30cm (12in) crack in the track at the accident site.

“There’s an initial point where the derailment is believed to have occurred,” Puente told the radio network Cadena Ser on Monday night. “Now we have to determine if it’s the cause or the consequence. It’s not a trivial matter, and it won’t be quick or easy. We’ll have to send the track to the lab; we have to determine what happened. At this point, nothing can be ruled out.”

Puente said marks had been found on the wheels of the first five carriages of the high-speed train, and on the wheels of other trains that had travelled along the same stretch of track before the derailment.

“The question now is how those marks appeared,” the minister told the TV channel Telecinco. “Was there something on the tracks, or was the track itself beginning to break down? At this point, it’s not possible to draw any conclusions about what caused those marks.”

Spain’s efforts to mourn the dead have been marred by familiar political squabbles. A spokesperson for the far-right Vox party said the Adamuz tragedy was proof of the decline of the country’s once-great rail services.

“All Spaniards can see with their own eyes that it’s not safe to travel and that the damage is getting worse by the day,” Pepa Millán said, adding: “Spaniards are scared to get on a train.”

Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, has attempted to link the Adamuz accident to the series of corruption allegations that have enveloped the socialist-led government. “Corruption destroys confidence in our institutions,” he said. “And corruption kills.”

The conservative People’s party (PP) called for Puente, who has made numerous media appearances over the past few days, to provide “absolute transparency”.

“The minister has a knack for talking,” said the PP infrastructure spokesperson, Juan Bravo. “But it’s time for him to offer explanations and not spend two hours saying nothing.”

The government’s spokesperson, Elma Saiz, said Abascal’s comments were abhorrent. “Given the two tragic nights we’ve just endured, with dozens of injured still hospitalised and not all the bodies recovered, Abascal’s attitude is despicable,” she said. “Using tragedy and fear to generate chaos and distrust is an anti-democratic and inhumane act.”","Spain’s largest train drivers’ union has called a three-day nationwide strike to demand measures to guarantee the safety of railworkers and passengers after two deadly crashes this week killed at least 46 people, including two drivers.

Brileigh and Kyler Dailey were both active in athletics at Clyde High School

""All I could think was, 'Please let this not be one of our kids,' "" said Bryan Allen, the superintendent of Clyde Consolidated Independent School District

A teenage brother and sister were killed when their truck was hit by a train in Texas and ""engulfed in flames"" over the weekend, authorities said.

""All I could think was, 'Please let this not be one of our kids,' "" Bryan Allen, the superintendent of the Clyde Consolidated Independent School District, told CBS affiliate KEYE of learning about the fatal crash that killed two students in Clyde on Sunday, Feb. 1.

The victims were later identified as siblings Brileigh Janae Dailey, 19, and 16-year-old Kyler Dailey.

""Didn't even run through my mind that it could have been two of them,” Allen said.

That Sunday, around 2:45 p.m. local time, officials responded to reports of a crash at the railroad crossing at County Road 243 and Farm-to-Market Road 18, KEYE, ABC affiliate KTXS and NBC affiliate KRBC reported.

“On the north side of that intersection is the entrance to a private driveway,” Sgt. Marc Couch of the Texas Department of Public Safety told KTXS. “A Ford F-150 was attempting to exit that area, crossing the railroad tracks, and failed to yield the right of way to an oncoming train.”

Following the collision, the truck became “fully engulfed in flames,” Couch told the outlet.

Kyler was driving at the time, while his sister was a passenger in the truck, KRBC reported.

Both children died as a result of the collision, according to the outlets.

The Texas Department of Public Safety had no further comment when contacted by PEOPLE beyond confirming the information from the investigation so far.

Immediately following the crash, the superintendent rushed to the railroad crossing, where other district employees had already congregated.

""It's heartbreaking when you pull up on that scene,"" Allen told KEYE. ""We already had staff members there, and they're in tears, and kids are in tears and it's just a horrible, horrible sight. It's the last thing you ever want to hear or see.""

The school district is providing support to both students and staff.

""It's a difficult day,"" Allen said. ""Extremely hard for all of us. Fortunately, we've had so many people reach out and offer support.""

Kyler Dailey. GoFundMe

Brileigh had just graduated from Clyde High School last year, and Kyler was a junior, according to a GoFundMe to support their family following the ""unimaginable tragedy.""

Kyler ran track and played football and his sister was a cheerleader and participated in softball.

“They were deeply loved and will always be remembered for the joy, kindness, and light they brought to those around them,” wrote the organizer of the donation page. “Their loss has created a pain that words cannot fully express.”

 A teenage brother and sister were killed when their truck was hit by a train in Texas and ""engulfed in flames"" over the weekend, authorities said.


 ""All I could think was, 'Please let this not be one of our kids,' "" Bryan Allen, the superintendent of the Clyde Consolidated Independent School District, told CBS affiliate KEYE of learning about the fatal crash that killed two students in Clyde on Sunday, Feb. 1.


 The victims were later identified as siblings Brileigh Janae Dailey, 19, and 16-year-old Kyler Dailey.


 ""Didn't even run through my mind that it could have been two of them,” Allen said.


 That Sunday, around 2:45 p.m. local time, officials responded to reports of a crash at the railroad crossing at County Road 243 and Farm-to-Market Road 18, KEYE, ABC affiliate KTXS and NBC affiliate KRBC reported. 


 “On the north side of that intersection is the entrance to a private driveway,” Sgt. Marc Couch of the Texas Department of Public Safety told KTXS. “A Ford F-150 was attempting to exit that area, crossing the railroad tracks, and failed to yield the right of way to an oncoming train.”


 Following the collision, the truck became “fully engulfed in flames,” Couch told the outlet.


 Kyler was driving at the time, while his sister was a passenger in the truck, KRBC reported.


 Both children died as a result of the collision, according to the outlets.


 The Texas Department of Public Safety had no further comment when contacted by PEOPLE beyond confirming the information from the investigation so far.



 Immediately following the crash, the superintendent rushed to the railroad crossing, where other district employees had already congregated.


 ""It's heartbreaking when you pull up on that scene,"" Allen told KEYE. ""We already had staff members there, and they're in tears, and kids are in tears and it's just a horrible, horrible sight. It's the last thing you ever want to hear or see.""


 The school district is providing support to both students and staff.


 ""It's a difficult day,"" Allen said. ""Extremely hard for all of us. Fortunately, we've had so many people reach out and offer support.""

 Brileigh had just graduated from Clyde High School last year, and Kyler was a junior, according to a GoFundMe to support their family following the ""unimaginable tragedy.""


 Kyler ran track and played football and his sister was a cheerleader and participated in softball.


 “They were deeply loved and will always be remembered for the joy, kindness, and light they brought to those around them,” wrote the organizer of the donation page. “Their loss has created a pain that words cannot fully express.”

A 43-car train carrying liquid propane cars derailed Thursday morning in Mansfield, causing a shutdown of several roads, a shelter-in-place notice for some residents and a mass emergency response.

The derailment occurred about 9:08 a.m., and officials quickly closed Route 32 between Route 44E and Route 75. The road is expected to be closed for some time as emergency response teams work to clean up the accident.

The train had 43 cars, 13 of which derailed. Six containing liquid propane were among the derailed cars, and four of those ended up partially in the Willimantic River, according to state officials.

“It’s primarily the six cars that we’re really worried about right now, where the … cars that were on their side and off the tracks completely,” Mansfield Fire Chief John Roache said.

State police said there were no injuries. A conductor and engineer were on the train when it derailed. One of the derailed cars was carrying cooking grease and leaked about 2,500 gallons, according to a press release.

A shelter in place order was issued for residents within a half mile of 1090 Stafford Road for a possible gas leak, but officials said at a noon press conference that they have found no evidence of a leak. They plan to continue monitoring it until the site is cleared, which could be days.

Because of the remoteness of the area where the train derailed, it will take days to remove them, Roache said.

Cranes were on their way to the scene Thursday afternoon and were expected to Thursday night, with more equipment arriving Friday morning, according to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.

State officials said they issued the shelter in place order until they could get a sense of whether a leak had occurred.

“So our fear was, if there was a leak, you might not smell it in your house,” Roache said. “So just out of an abundance of caution, we are just telling people, just close your windows and stay inside for right now.”

The train was with the New England Central Railroad, which is owned by Genesee & Wyoming Inc., officials said.

Besides the liquid gas, it was carrying lumber, grain, and grease.

University of Connecticut officials said the train derailment did not impact the nearby campus. UConn spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said the school did “send a notification to employees and students to inform them about the delays and encourage them to take other routes.”

Several state agencies responded to the emergency and will be on site for several days, according to Rich Scalora, the supervising emergency response coordinator for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Scalora said they put booms in the river as a precaution because the cars were in the river.

The cleanup process will be a challenge, Scalora said.

“How are they going to handle each car? Each car is going to be a little different, and they’re discussing right now — they’re still doing evaluation. Do they take the product off, or do they move the car intact?” Scalora said.

The back-to-back disasters in January shocked the country and raised doubts about the safety of train travel in Spain, which boasts one of the world's most extensive high-speed rail networks.
""The entire state is doing -- and will continue to do -- everything possible to support the injured and the victims' families, clarify the causes of the accident, and, if necessary, ensure justice is done,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Spain's rail system ""is not perfect, but it is safe"", he added, vowing to take all necessary measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
Shock hit the rail sector after a collision between two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia on January 18 resulted in the death of 46 people -- one of Europe's deadliest such disasters this century.
Two days later, a commuter train in the Barcelona region ploughed into the rubble of a collapsed wall following heavy rain, killing the driver and injuring dozens.
The government reached a deal with railway unions on Monday to invest 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to improve maintenance, create 3,650 jobs, and strengthen public rail safety.
The agreement prompted unions to call off a three-day strike.
The conservative opposition has called for Sanchez's resignation, blaming the accidents on underinvestment in maintenance and understaffing.
Popular Party (PP) chief Alberto Nunez Feijoo accused the government in parliament of having ""played Russian roulette with our safety"".
He said the accident in Andalusia was ""preventable, not an unforeseeable catastrophe"" and blasted the government for not apologising and ""taking responsibility"".
The head of far-right Vox, Santiago Abascal, called it ""a crime and not just an accident"".
""A crime that will weigh on your consciences and for which I hope you will answer before the courts,"" he added.
- 'Much to improve' -
A preliminary report suggested the track may have been cracked before the catastrophe in Andalusia.
Concerns over Spain’s rail network come as Sanchez faces several corruption scandals in his inner circle that have weakened his fragile minority coalition.
His Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in a regional election in Aragon on Sunday, following their worst-ever regional result in their former stronghold, Extremadura, in December.
In both elections the PP came on top while Vox made huge gains.
Private operators began running passenger trains in Spain in 2021 following the liberalisation of the rail sector, ending Renfe's decades-long monopoly.
Since then, passenger numbers on some routes have grown noticeably, but the unions say investment in maintenance has not kept up.
But Sanchez said his government had nearly tripled investment in railway infrastructure since it came to power in 2018.
He accused the previous PP government of underinvestment in the national rail network which he said carries over 12 million passengers each week.
""There is still work to be done, without a doubt, and much to improve,"" Sanchez told lawmakers.

The updates span MARTA track protection procedures, an HSI Port of Stockton rerailing accident, and conductor injuries connected to switching or shoving movements.

NTSB rail accident reports: key findings and updates

One report centers on an Oct. 19, 2024, incident in Atlanta involving Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). The NTSB concluded that MARTA track protection procedures were insufficient for the location and type of work being performed.

Don’t miss…1000th U-trough milestone for Victoria’s rail bridges

A technician working on wayside train approach lights was struck by a MARTA train. Investigators said the procedures did not provide adequate warning time for technicians to move to safety before the train arrived, consistent with the NTSB Railroad Investigation Report (RIR2602). The NTSB also cited a contributing factor: the designated lookout was performing tasks not consistent with his duties, which meant the oncoming train was not detected in time.

HSI Port of Stockton rerailing accident

The NTSB also issued findings on a March 11, 2025, accident involving Hulcher Services Inc. (HSI) at the Port of Stockton in California. The board determined the probable cause was the lack of a standardized process for how and where a crew member should be safely positioned when operating a hand brake during a rerailing operation.

According to the NTSB, an HSI assistant division manager trainee was seriously hurt while working as part of an eight-person crew rerailing four rail cars that had derailed. After the accident, HSI added a new rule to its safe practices handbook and incorporated it into its standard operating procedures.

Public dockets for Union Pacific and R. J. Corman cases

In addition to investigation reports, the NTSB opened the public docket for its ongoing investigation of a June 25, 2025, accident in Lexington, Nebraska, involving a Union Pacific Railroad conductor. The conductor was seriously injured while riding the lead tank car during a shoving movement.

The NTSB also opened a public docket for its ongoing investigation of a June 26, 2025, accident at Guthrie Yard in Guthrie, Kentucky. The case involves an R. J. Corman Railway Group conductor who was seriously injured during a rail-car switching operation. Although the docket has been opened, it has not been released as of today.

BNSF grade crossing welding truck accident near New Rockford

Another NTSB investigation report addressed a Nov. 4, 2024, accident near New Rockford, North Dakota, involving BNSF Railway employees. A BNSF Railway maintenance-of-way employee was fatally struck by a BNSF freight train while driving a welding truck across a highway–railroad grade crossing, and another maintenance-of-way employee in the passenger seat was injured.

The NTSB determined the probable cause was the welding team’s failure to detect the approaching BNSF freight train as they backed the welding truck over the private grade crossing.

A contributing factor was the team’s noncompliance with, and lack of understanding of, BNSF’s safety rule S-12.8; Railway Supply also summarizes the NTSB’s conclusions in its coverage of the case, NTSB final report BNSF collision: N.D. crash findings. After the accident, BNSF clarified the backing rule.

WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Charles E Peck died on impact in the 2008 Metrolink disaster in California, but his mobile phone mysteriously made 35 calls to loved ones over 11 hours, ultimately helping locate his body

View 2 Images Charles Peck died on impact (Image: findagrave.com)

In a heartbreaking and bewildering night for his relatives, one father-of-three's mobile continued trying to contact his family following his tragic death in a train collision.

‌



Charles E Peck was amongst those who died in the catastrophic San Fernando Valley Metrolink incident which came to be known as the Chatsworth crash.

‌



Peck was recently engaged to Andrea Katz and the 49-year-old had three youngsters from a former marriage.

‌



On 12 September 2008 at 4:22pm the passenger train transporting 225 travellers collided at a combined velocity of 83 mph with a cargo train operated by a three-person crew, according to Snopes.

Tragically, there were 135 individuals wounded, 87 of whom were taken to hospital, with 46 in critical condition. Devastatingly, 25 died, reports the Mirror US.

‌



Peck, a customer service representative for Delta Air Lines at Salt Lake City International Airport died on impact. However, eerily, his mobile phone told a different story.

The 49 year old had travelled to Los Angeles for a job interview at Van Nuys Airport - he was seeking fresh employment in California so he could wed his Westlake Village fiancée.

Horrifically, Katz discovered the crash on the radio whilst she was travelling to collect Peck from the station. She was with his parents and siblings.

‌



Distressingly, his family began to receive telephone calls from Peck. For 11 hours they were bombarded with agonising calls from his phone, ringing his son, his brother, his stepmother, his sister, and his fiancée.

A disturbing total of 35 calls from the phone were made throughout the night - whilst his family remained unsure whether he was dead or alive. The phone calls provided the grieving relatives with hope that he was still living and merely trapped.

Upon answering the mysterious calls, all they could hear was static, and when they rang back, the calls went directly to voicemail.

‌



Eventually, Peck's body was retrieved from the wreckage 12 hours following the accident.

The flurry of calls prompted search teams to track the location of the phone through its signal and to examine once more what remained of the first train, the place from which the calls were originating.

The searchers ultimately located Peck's body roughly an hour after the calls from his mobile phone ended.

‌



Chillingly, it was revealed Peck died on impact - and his phone continued working beyond his death to contact those he cherished most.

Crucially, these calls also ensured his body was found, though his phone was never recovered.

A preliminary inquiry into the deadliest incident in Metrolink's history determined that the engineer operating the commuter train had failed to acknowledge a red signal.

This resulted in the train entering a single track with the Union Pacific freight train that had been given clearance.",,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,tf_html,2008-09-12

The investigation continues into why the driver of a Tesla crashed into a light rail parking lot in Folsom on Thursday, Jan. 22, an accident that tragically killed a pedestrian.
The crash happened just before 3 p.m. in the area of Folsom Blvd. and Iron Point Road at the Iron Point Light Rail station.

Charles Peck's mobile made 35 calls to loved ones for 11 hours after he was killed in the 2008 Chatsworth Metrolink disaster in California

In a heart-wrenching and painful night for his family, a father-of-three's phone kept trying to reach his loved ones after his tragic death in a railway crash.

‌



Charles E Peck was one of the victims in the devastating San Fernando Valley Metrolink accident, now known as the Chatsworth crash.

‌



Peck, who was newly engaged to Andrea Katz and had three children from a previous marriage, was 49 at the time of the accident.

‌



On 12 September 2008 at 4:22pm, the commuter train he was on, carrying 225 passengers, collided with a freight train at a combined speed of 83 mph, according to Snopes.

The crash resulted in 135 people being injured, 87 of whom were rushed to hospital, with 46 in critical condition. Tragically, 25 people lost their lives, reports the Mirror US.

‌



Peck, who worked as a customer service agent for Delta Air Lines at Salt Lake City International Airport, died instantly. However, eerily, his mobile phone told a different story.

The 49-year-old had travelled to Los Angeles for a job interview at Van Nuys Airport - he was seeking employment in California so he could marry his Westlake Village fiancé.

Shockingly, Katz heard about the crash on the radio while she was en route to pick up Peck from the station. She was accompanied by his parents and siblings.

‌



In a horrifying twist, his loved ones began receiving phone calls from Peck's number. For 11 hours, they were flooded with distressing calls from his phone, reaching out to his son, brother, stepmother, sister, and fiancé.

A chilling total of 35 calls were made from the phone throughout the night - while his family were still unsure if he was dead or alive. The phone calls gave the grieving loved ones hope that he was still alive and simply trapped.

‌



Upon answering the ghostly calls, all they heard was static and when they called back, the calls went straight to voicemail.

Eventually, Peck's body was recovered from the wreckage 12 hours after the accident.

The flurry of calls prompted search crews to trace the whereabouts of the phone through its signal and to once again sift through what was left of the first train, the location the calls were coming from.

‌



The searchers finally found Peck's body about an hour after the calls from his mobile phone stopped.

Eerily, it was discovered Peck died on impact - and his phone worked beyond his death to reach out to those who he loved most.

Ultimately these calls also meant his body was discovered, however his phone was never found.

A preliminary investigation into the deadliest accident in Metrolink's history found that the engineer operating the commuter train had failed to recognise a red signal.

This meant the train entered a single track with the Union Pacific freight train that was given the go ahead.","Mystery as dad killed in train horror then called his family 35 times

Charles Peck's mobile made 35 calls to loved ones for 11 hours after he was killed in the 2008 Chatsworth Metrolink disaster in California

In a heart-wrenching and painful night for his family, a father-of-three's phone kept trying to reach his loved ones after his tragic death in a railway crash.

Charles E Peck was one of the victims in the devastating San Fernando Valley Metrolink accident, now known as the Chatsworth crash.

Peck, who was newly engaged to Andrea Katz and had three children from a previous marriage, was 49 at the time of the accident.

On 12 September 2008 at 4:22pm, the commuter train he was on, carrying 225 passengers, collided with a freight train at a combined speed of 83 mph, according to Snopes.

The crash resulted in 135 people being injured, 87 of whom were rushed to hospital, with 46 in critical condition. Tragically, 25 people lost their lives, reports the Mirror US.

Peck, who worked as a customer service agent for Delta Air Lines at Salt Lake City International Airport, died instantly. However, eerily, his mobile phone told a different story.

Shockingly, Katz heard about the crash on the radio while she was en route to pick up Peck from the station. She was accompanied by his parents and siblings.

In a horrifying twist, his loved ones began receiving phone calls from Peck's number. For 11 hours, they were flooded with distressing calls from his phone, reaching out to his son, brother, stepmother, sister, and fiancé.

A chilling total of 35 calls were made from the phone throughout the night - while his family were still unsure if he was dead or alive. The phone calls gave the grieving loved ones hope that he was still alive and simply trapped.

Upon answering the ghostly calls, all they heard was static and when they called back, the calls went straight to voicemail.

Eventually, Peck's body was recovered from the wreckage 12 hours after the accident.

The flurry of calls prompted search crews to trace the whereabouts of the phone through its signal and to once again sift through what was left of the first train, the location the calls were coming from.

The searchers finally found Peck's body about an hour after the calls from his mobile phone stopped.

Two people, including a bystander, were transported to a hospital

GLENDALE, CA, (February 04, 2026) - The Glendale Police Department said a 35-year-old woman was killed in a crash with a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train along Brazil Street on Wednesday morning.

Zukhra Kurbanova, 35, was killed Wednesday morning when her vehicle was struck by a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train at a crossing in Glendale.

She was identified by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner as Zukhra Kurbanova.

The crash occurred just west of the intersection of San Fernando Road and Broadway.

Kurbanova was driving a vehicle northbound on West San Fernando when she attempted to make a right turn onto Broadway around 9 a.m. and was struck by a Metrolink train traveling on the tracks. Tragically, she died at the scene from her injuries. The train was carrying roughly 150 passengers, three of whom were injured. One person was transported to a hospital. A bystander struck by debris from the crash was also hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.

Two trains, each on the Antelope Valley and San Bernardino lines, were canceled after the collision.

This is an ongoing investigation.

CRASH INVESTIGATION NEEDED Train accidents such as this can occur for several reasons, including train personnel error, train track failure, a mechanical error or malfunction, a signalman error, and reckless actions. Each year, train-related crashes claim hundreds of lives across the United States. Many of these fatalities result from poorly marked crossings, malfunctioning signals and inadequate fencing. Railroad deaths totaled 954 in 2024, a 1% decrease from the 2023 revised total of 967, the National Safety Council said in a report. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the crash site was made safe for the crossing. Candice Bond, who specializes in train-related crashes, said that in cases such as this, it is imperative to have an independent investigation conducted by a seasoned lawyer as soon as possible to preserve evidence for a victim's family. “A skilled attorney can protect a grieving family from powerful train companies, which often send their investigators to crash sites and possess a variety of resources they can utilize to defend a negligent party,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal.

Spain is still reeling from Sunday's high-speed train collision in the southern Andalusia region that killed at least 43 people.

Two days after that, a commuter train derailed after a containment wall fell on the track due to heavy rain near the city of Barcelona, killing the driver and seriously injuring four passengers.

The main train drivers' union called a nationwide strike over safety standards after a second collision in the northeastern Catalonia region on Tuesday.

Legislators are urging Congress to pass the Railway Safety Act on the third anniversary of the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.

The bill has received bipartisan support but has not moved forward to a vote in either the U.S. House or Senate.

The Railway Safety Act would increase safety regulations, require two-person crews, and improve communication with communities and first responders.

Railroad worker unions and labor organizations are advocating for the legislation, citing an increase in derailments and hazardous material releases since 2016.

Rep. Chris Deluzio and several other legislators are urging their colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate to finally pass legislation for stronger train safety regulations on the third anniversary of the Norfolk Southern train derailment disaster that has affected communities around East Palestine, Ohio, and the Darlington Township area of Beaver County.

Deluzio appeared with Rep. Mike Rulli of Ohio, Rep. John Garamendi of California, Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, representatives of associations for railroad workers, firefighters and labor unions and others at a Feb. 3 press conference in Washington, calling for Congress to resume efforts to pass the Railway Safety Act of 2025.

Communities helping each other: Patrick O'Shea: On darkest night, East Palestine people shone the brightest

The Railway Safety Act has received broad support from lawmakers in both the U.S. House and the Senate, Deluzio said in a Feb. 2 interview with The Beaver County Times.

He said that Vice President JD Vance, as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, sponsored the bill in the Senate in 2023 with Sen. John Fetterman and former Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. President Donald Trump also endorsed the Railway Safety Act as a presidential candidate, Deluzio said.

But three years after the derailment, he said, this legislation has not moved beyond those respective chambers, even as other communities across the country have been affected by train derailments involving the release of hazardous chemicals.

""A lot of people, whether in East Palestine or beside the border in Pennsylvania, they're still worried, they still have concerns about their health. I think everyone expects our government to change the rules to make trains operate more safely, so I'm in that fight for as long as it takes,"" Deluzio said.

Sen. John Fetterman also released a public statement on Feb. 3 to mark the derailment anniversary and urged his fellow senators to pass the Railway Safety Act, calling the bill ""commonsense legislation"" and adding that after three years, ""Congress still hasn't done right by these communities.""

What is the Railway Safety Act?

The Railway Safety Act would improve railway safety by broadening the list of hazardous materials where additional safety protections are required when shipped by rail, and require that railroads notify state emergency response officials in advance when, where and what kinds of hazardous materials are being transported by rail through their communities.

The act would also require a minimum of two crew members on a freight train, increase and enforce railcar inspections and expand the use of wayside defect detectors along railroads to alert railroad workers to potential defects and equipment failures. The National Transportation Safety Board determined in June 2024 that a wheel bearing on a railcar failed and overheated, causing the train derailment in East Palestine.

The legislation would also increase maximum fines on rail carriers for violating safety regulations, which now are more of ""a slap on the wrist,"" Deluzio said.

""(T)he folks who live around the tracks, they can't be treated like collateral damage (for) railroad profits. So I think the safety measures are about making sure our communities have more confidence that when trains are coming through carrying something dangerous, they’re operating more safely, that you have notification to first responders about what's on the trains coming through.""

Under Pressure Act: Congress introduces another bill to prevent train derailment disasters

'It's about partnership'

Matt Pacifico, the mayor of Altoona in Blair County, spoke at the press conference about a 17-car derailment that occurred in 2014 in his city and how he found out about the derailment, not from the railroad but from a news reporter calling for his comment on the accident.

""That moment made something very clear; when it comes to rail safety, communication between railroads and the communities they pass through is not where it needs to be,"" he said.

""Local leaders and first responders should never be the last to know when something happens on the tracks that run through the center of their cities. Effective rail safety depends not only on what happens on the rails, but on how well railroads communicate with the people responsible for protecting the public where those rails run.

""This isn't about placing blame; it's about partnership. It's about railroads being good neighbors in the communities across the country by keeping us informed and involved, because when communication improves, rail safety improves for everyone.""

Unions offer support for Railway Safety Act

Rail workers have been involved in formulating the regulations in the Railway Safety Act and are advocating for these reforms, according to Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and chair of the Rail Labor Division of the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.

""Let's say this plainly, because the truth matters: This (the East Palestine derailment) was not a fluke, this was not bad luck. It was the foreseeable result of a system that has been allowed, even encouraged, to put profits ahead of safety,"" Baldwin said at the Feb. 3 press conference in Washington.

""For years, rail workers have been sounding the alarm. We warned of longer trains with fewer crew members, we warned of rushed inspections, we warned about outdated braking systems, we warned about relentless pressure to move faster, haul more and do it all with less.

""Today, we are calling on Congress to act and pass the Railway Safety Act. We weren't asking for special treatment; we were asking for basic safety, for ourselves and for the communities we pass through every single day.

""When we demand change, we make sure what happened here never happens again.""

Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, said during the press conference that the derailment rate on mainline tracks has increased 25% over the last 10 years, and hazardous materials releases have increased 23% during that same period.

""That is an unacceptable level of risk, and one that we should be demanding better of. Congress should be demanding it, unions should be demanding it,"" Regan said.

The TTD represents workers in 40 unions nationwide, including all freight and passenger rail transportation workers.

""Not a single person in this room is advocating for hurting the railroads; we actually want to see the railroads grow. We think they're an important economic driver of this country, we think they're the best way to move a lot of these goods across the country in a way that is most efficient, best for communities, best for economic development,"" Regan said.

""But when you look at where safety is going on class one railroads, it would be alarming in any other industry. There would be a reckoning if we had the types of numbers we're talking about in class 1 railroads and freight rail in aviation, or trucking (industry). The labor movement is ready to work with you all, to make sure that we can achieve a rail system that we can all be proud of.

""I do not want to be back here next year, or at the five-year anniversary, the 10-year anniversary, or heaven forbid, when there's another tragedy, one that shocks another community, or even worse, when lives are lost because of that tragedy.

What is the Railway Safety Act?

The Railway Safety Act would improve railway safety by broadening the list of hazardous materials where additional safety protections are required when shipped by rail, and require that railroads notify state emergency response officials in advance when, where and what kinds of hazardous materials are being transported by rail through their communities.

The act would also require a minimum of two crew members on a freight train, increase and enforce railcar inspections and expand the use of wayside defect detectors along railroads to alert railroad workers to potential defects and equipment failures. The National Transportation Safety Board determined in June 2024 that a wheel bearing on a railcar failed and overheated, causing the train derailment in East Palestine.

The legislation would also increase maximum fines on rail carriers for violating safety regulations, which now are more of ""a slap on the wrist,"" Deluzio said.

""(T)he folks who live around the tracks, they can't be treated like collateral damage (for) railroad profits.

""That is an unacceptable level of risk, and one that we should be demanding better of. Congress should be demanding it, unions should be demanding it,"" Regan said.

The TTD represents workers in 40 unions nationwide, including all freight and passenger rail transportation workers.

""Not a single person in this room is advocating for hurting the railroads; we actually want to see the railroads grow. We think they're an important economic driver of this country, we think they're the best way to move a lot of these goods across the country in a way that is most efficient, best for communities, best for economic development,"" Regan said.

""But when you look at where safety is going on class one railroads, it would be alarming in any other industry. There would be a reckoning if we had the types of numbers we're talking about in class 1 railroads and freight rail in aviation, or trucking (industry). The labor movement is ready to work with you all, to make sure that we can achieve a rail system that we can all be proud of.

""I do not want to be back here next year, or at the five-year anniversary, the 10-year anniversary, or heaven forbid, when there's another tragedy, one that shocks another community, or even worse, when lives are lost because of that tragedy. We cannot accept the status quo as good enough.""",0.3333333333333333,,,,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

On Dec. 19, 2025, an eastbound train struck a stopped train on a sharp curve west of Bay Street, according to a preliminary report released Friday by the National Transportation Safety Board.

The standing train did not come into view of the striking train until it was about 126 feet away.

The train that struck the stopped train was traveling about 17 mph and operating under a restricted‑speed signal that required it to move slowly enough to stop within sight, the NTSB said.

Investigators said they will now turn their attention to whether Positive Train Control functioned as intended while the train was operating under restricted-speed rules.

The preliminary report did not note any findings about the system, which was installed on all NJ Transit trains in 2018 to satisfy a federal requirement.

No conclusions have been reached at this time,” Keith Holloway, a NTSB spokesperson, said in response to emailed questions by NJ Advance Media. Typically, the agency completes crash investigations within one to two years.

Emergency crews responded to the scene after the trains collided last month.

Six crew members—three from each train—were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries. The 11 passengers on the struck train declined further medical treatment.

The crash caused about $180,000 in damage to the trains and tracks, the NTSB said. NJ Transit declined to comment when reached by NJ Advance Media.

Before the collision, both trains had been traveling westbound on track 1.

NJ Transit rerouted them onto track 2 in the opposite direction—sending them eastbound—to avoid downed trees that were blocking the line after a storm earlier that evening, federal investigators said.

At the crash site, investigators examined the track, signals and equipment.

They also conducted sight‑distance observations using trains, reviewed event recorder data and image recorders from both trains. The NTSB also requested NJ Transit’s dispatcher radio and telephone recordings, and interviewed employees.

MADRID (AP) — After back-to-back fatal train crashes sent shock waves through Spain, some good news arrived on Thursday: Boro, the missing dog, was found.

Days earlier, Boro’s owner Ana García issued a desperate plea to help find him after the dog bolted Sunday in the aftermath of the high-speed train crash in southern Spain that killed at least 45 people. García, 26, and her pregnant sister were traveling with Boro on the train that derailed.

On Thursday, forest firefighters in southern Spain found the black-and-white pooch, and posted images that showed García with one of her legs in a brace embracing Boro. Sitting inside a car, she spoke to reporters.

“Many thanks to all of Spain and everyone who has got involved so much,” she said. “It gave me great hope and we’ve done it.”

The search for Boro appeared to provide Spaniards something to hope for amid the week’s tragedy, and ultimately something to celebrate.

For days, people had rallied online to find him, amplifying García’s call by sharing video of an interview she had given to local media. Photos of Boro, a medium-sized black dog with white eyebrows, went viral alongside phone numbers for García and her family. Spanish television broadcasters and newspapers covered the search.

García, her sister and the dog had been traveling Sunday by high-speed train from Malaga, their hometown in southern Spain, to the capital Madrid, when the tail of their train car jumped the rails for reasons that remain unclear, and smashed into another train.

The collision killed dozens and injured more than 150 people. Rescue crews helped García and her sister out of the tilted train car. That’s when she briefly saw Boro before he ran. She spoke to the cameras with a blanket draped over her shoulders and a bandage on her cheek after Spain’s worst rail accident in more than a decade.

“Please, if you can help, look for the animals,” a limping García told reporters at the time, choked up and holding back tears. “We were coming back from a family weekend with the little dog, who’s family, too.”

On Thursday, she had a bruise beneath her eye but, with Boro back by her side, also a smile plastered across her face.

“Now we have him and we have him for all our life,” García told reporters. “Now let’s go home, buddy.”

On Thursday, she had a bruise beneath her eye but, with Boro back by her side, also a smile plastered across her face.“Now we have him and we have him for all our life,” García told reporters. “Now let’s go home, buddy.” ___Associated Press journalist Teresa Medrano in Madrid contributed to this report.","MADRID (AP) — After back-to-back sent shock waves through Spain, some good news arrived on Thursday: Boro, the missing dog, was found.

Days earlier, Boro’s owner Ana García to help find him after the dog bolted Sunday in the aftermath of the high-speed that killed at least 45 people. García, 26, and her pregnant sister were traveling with Boro on the train that derailed.

On Thursday, forest firefighters in southern Spain found the black-and-white pooch, and posted images that showed García with one of her legs in a brace embracing Boro. Sitting inside a car, she spoke to reporters.

“Many thanks to all of Spain and everyone who has got involved so much,” she said. “It gave me great hope and we’ve done it.”

The search for Boro appeared to provide Spaniards something to hope for amid the week’s tragedy, and ultimately something to celebrate.

For days, people had rallied online to find him, amplifying García’s call by sharing video of an interview she had given to local media. Photos of Boro, a medium-sized black dog with white eyebrows, went viral alongside phone numbers for García and her family. Spanish television broadcasters and newspapers covered the search.

García, her sister and the dog had been traveling Sunday by high-speed train from Malaga, their hometown in southern to the capital Madrid, when the tail of their train car jumped the rails , and smashed into another train.

The collision killed dozens and injured more than 150 people. Rescue crews helped García and her sister out of the tilted train car. That’s when she briefly saw Boro before he ran. She spoke to the cameras with a blanket draped over her shoulders and a bandage on her cheek after Spain’s in more than a decade.

A fracture in a straight section of track ""occurred prior to the passage"" of a high-speed train that derailed, causing last Sunday's rail disaster in which 45 people died, an initial report has found.

A train run by private company Iryo derailed last Sunday and its rear carriages crossed on to the opposite track into the path of an oncoming train run by state-owned Renfe.

The CIAF rail investigation commission said not only did Iryo train's front carriages which stayed on the track have ""notches"" in their wheels, but three earlier trains that went over the track earlier did too.

A gap of almost 40cm (15in) in the track has become the focus of the investigation into the crash.

Sunday's deadly collision occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid.

The train's last three carriages - carriages six to eight - derailed and collided with the Huelva-bound Renfe train. ""Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track,"" the preliminary report finds.

Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train.

The 40cm gap in the track was clearly visible the day after the disaster at Adamuz [Guardia Civil]

Earlier this week, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed reports that grooves were found on the wheels of the Iryo train's carriages, which had passed over the track safely.

""These notches in the wheels and the deformation observed in the track are compatible with the fact that the track was cracked,"" the CIAF preliminary report said.

It added that three trains that had gone over the tracks at 17:21 on Sunday, 19:01 and then 19:09 had similar notches ""with a compatible geometric pattern"".

Similar grooves are found on carriages two, three and four of the Iryo train, the report says, but carriage five - the last that did not derail - had a groove on its outer edge, suggesting the rail was already tilting outwards before carriage six derailed.

The CIAF called its report a ""working hypothesis"", adding that it ""must be corroborated by later detailed calculations and analysis"".

The transport minister appeared before reporters again on Friday to say that it was too early to have definitive answers, but that if the cause of the crash was the fracture, then it occurred in the minutes and hours before the derailment and could not have been detected.

The Adamuz disaster is is the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade.

In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.","Track fractured before Spanish train disaster, report finds

A fracture in a straight section of track ""occurred prior to the passage"" of a high-speed train that derailed, causing last Sunday's rail disaster in which 45 people died, an initial report has found.

A train run by private company Iryo derailed last Sunday and its rear carriages crossed on to the opposite track into the path of an oncoming train run by state-owned Renfe.

The CIAF rail investigation commission said not only did Iryo train's front carriages which stayed on the track have ""notches"" in their wheels, but three earlier trains that went over the track earlier did too.

A gap of almost 40cm (15in) in the track has become the focus of the investigation into the crash.

Sunday's deadly collision occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid.

The train's last three carriages - carriages six to eight - derailed and collided with the Huelva-bound Renfe train. ""Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track,"" the preliminary report finds.

Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train.

natural disaster, any calamitous occurrence generated by the effects of natural, rather than human-driven, phenomena that produces great loss of humanlife or destruction of the natural environment, private property, or public infrastructure. A natural disaster may be caused by weather and climate events or by earthquakes, landslides, and other occurrences that originate at Earth’s surface or within the planet itself. No spot on Earth is immune from a natural disaster; however, certain types of disasters are often limited to or occur more frequently in specific geographic regions.
Types
Weather- and climate-driven natural disasters include flooding caused by heavy rains associated with hurricanes and typhoons (tropical cyclones) and other intense storms; drought, famine, and wildfires brought on by heat waves and shifts in precipitation patterns; wind-generated devastation caused by tropical cyclones, tornadoes, derechos, and other windstorms; and damage and loss of life caused by blizzards and heavy snowfalls. Earth-driven natural disasters include large volcanic eruptions (which produce lava flows, explosions, toxic gas clouds, ash falls, and pyroclastic flows that damage populated areas) and strong earthquakes (which result from the sudden fracturing of Earth’s crust) powerful enough to damage or destroy built-up areas near their origin points.
Some phenomena that produce natural disasters may be caused by a combination of several different forces. For example, landslides (the movement of large masses of rock, debris, and soil downslope) may be caused by rains that saturate the soil on an unstable slope, or they may be triggered by earthquakes. In a similar manner, the buildup of snow on mountain slopes increases the risks of localized avalanches. Tsunamis, catastrophic ocean waves that can rise as high as 30 metres (about 100 feet) above normal sea level, are produced by submarine earthquakes, underwater or coastal landslides, volcanic eruptions, or meteor or comet impacts. The largest tsunamis are fast-moving waves that can travel across oceans to wreak havoc in coastal areas separated thousands of kilometres from one another.
Frequency and disaster patterns
Certain types of natural disasters are more likely to occur in specific geographic regions, and in some places these events occur with seasonal regularity, as in the spring tornado season in the United States or the summer-and-fall hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are most frequent near tectonic plate boundaries, and an especially active boundary exists between the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO)—a United Nations (UN) agency that monitors Earth’s land, water, and atmosphere—reported in 2021 that the number of natural disasters per decade showed a fivefold increase from 1979 to 2019, and data collected in the EM-DAT, an international disaster database maintained by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, Brussels, indicate that more than 300 disasters have been tallied each year since 1998. Though many natural disasters are neither preventable nor largely predictable, the WMO report notes that global warming—an increasingly human-driven phenomenon generated by the emission of greenhouse gases, specifically those released by the combustion of fossil fuels—is increasing the frequency of weather- and climate-related natural disasters, such as droughts, heat waves, increasingly intense hurricanes, and flooding due to sea-level rise. Warmer temperatures are causing more extreme weather events by delivering more precipitation to some areas—which may be unused to receiving heavy rains and snows, increasing flooding risk—while delivering less to other areas that rely on it, increasing drought risk. In addition, reliable sources of rainfall, such as the South Asian monsoon, on which agriculture of the Indian subcontinent has long depended, are becoming less predictable, and rain events have become more violent and dangerous, damaging crops and producing more intense flooding. This change has subjected some areas under the monsoon’s influence to extended drought conditions, whereas other areas receive too much rainfall, a pattern that scientists predict will worsen in the 21st century.
Damage and deaths
The costs of individual natural disasters frequently reach the tens of billions of dollars. Such costs may be associated with damage to crops, buildings, and infrastructure that occurs annually in areas prone to tropical cyclone activity or heavy seasonal rains, with some events, such as the Pakistan floods of 2022 and Hurricane Katrina (which struck the southern United States in 2005), costing more than $30 billion and $186 billion, respectively. Similarly, costs associated with earthquakes, which occur less regularly, can be high (such as China’s Sichuan earthquake of 2008 and Japan’s Kōbe earthquake of 1995, which incurred costs estimated at more than $86 billion and more than $100 billion, respectively).
The number of deaths from natural disasters also varies by location and the intensity of the event; however, the overall trend points to a decline from several hundreds of thousands of deaths annually during the first half of the 20th century to roughly 45,000 deaths globally each year. The number of deaths also varies widely from year to year, with smaller natural disasters (or natural disasters occurring in areas far from human settlement) killing few and shockingly large disasters producing truly massive losses of life. Some of the most notable catastrophic disasters in history include the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 (which killed more than 225,000 people), the Tangshan earthquake of 1976 (which resulted in more than 242,000 deaths), the 2010 Haiti earthquake (which by some estimates may have killed at least 300,000 people), and China’s Shaanxi province earthquake of 1556 (which killed more than 800,000 people).

Although deaths from natural disasters have decreased overall, people in lower-income countries often suffer disproportionately, because these locations have fewer resources and thus greater vulnerability to the elements and to food insecurity. In contrast, highly developed countries have better infrastructure (for communications, evacuation procedures, the movement of resources, and the delivery of medical services). In addition, high-income countries can implement policies that limit construction in flood-prone areas or mandate the construction of more earthquake-resistant homes, office buildings, and other structures, thereby reducing the risk of crushing injury and death stemming from building collapses. Consequently, relatively few people die from earthquakes in California, a location well-known for its strong building codes with respect to withstanding earthquakes, compared with places such as Iran and Pakistan, where building codes are either less stringent or whose codes frequently go unenforced.
Disaster warning systems
Advances in weather forecasting and advances in land-based seismic sensors and sensors placed aboard satellites, aircraft, and stationary buoys floating in the world’s oceans have led to the development of various kinds of early warning systems. In some cases, these systems are capable of predicting or accurately classifying the strength of the physical forces that generate natural disasters before they cause damage. The perhaps most widespread and best known of these systems are those used by national weather bureaus that classify, track, and predict various weather events and issue bulletins about storms and other weather and climate phenomena affecting their land areas and sea zones. National weather bureaus are often made up of a network of numerous local offices spread across a country that gauge local weather conditions several times per day. Data collected by these offices can be used to develop weather models that help to predict the strength of a storm, as well as its location, days in advance of its arrival in a local area.
In addition, specialized units within national governments—such as the China Earthquake Administration, the Japan Meteorological Agency, the United Kingdom’s Met Office, India’s National Center of Seismology, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Geological Survey—monitor specific physical forces capable of causing the most damaging and deadly natural disasters (that is, earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, flooding, and winds driven by tornadoes and tropical cyclones). Many of these organizations within specific countries cooperate with their counterparts in others or assist international organizations, such as the WMO and the International Tsunami Information Center, to issue warnings, develop international safety standards, and assess the risks associated with forces that affect several countries or the planet as a whole. Some early warning systems even look beyond Earth’s atmosphere; the near-Earth objects system operated by the European Space Agency and the Scout and Sentry impact hazard systems run by NASA in the United States are a few of several systems designed to detect, track, and predict the risk associated with asteroids, comets, and other extraterrestrial objects capable of striking Earth.

Types Weather- and climate-driven natural disasters include flooding caused by heavy rains associated with hurricanes and typhoons (tropical cyclones) and other intense storms; drought, famine, and wildfires brought on by heat waves and shifts in precipitation patterns; wind-generated devastation caused by tropical cyclones, tornadoes, derechos, and other windstorms; and damage and loss of life caused by blizzards and heavy snowfalls. Earth-driven natural disasters include large volcanic eruptions (which produce lava flows, explosions, toxic gas clouds, ash falls, and pyroclastic flows that damage populated areas) and strong earthquakes (which result from the sudden fracturing of Earth’s crust) powerful enough to damage or destroy built-up areas near their origin points. landslideA landslide is a movement downslope of a mass of rock, debris, earth, or soil (soil being a mixture of earth and debris). (more)Some phenomena that produce natural disasters may be caused by a combination of several different forces. For example, landslides (the movement of large masses of rock, debris, and soil downslope) may be caused by rains that saturate the soil on an unstable slope, or they may be triggered by earthquakes. In a similar manner, the buildup of snow on mountain slopes increases the risks of localized avalanches. Tsunamis, catastrophic ocean waves that can rise as high as 30 metres (about 100 feet) above normal sea level, are produced by submarine earthquakes, underwater or coastal landslides, volcanic eruptions, or meteor or comet impacts. The largest tsunamis are fast-moving waves that can travel across oceans to wreak havoc in coastal areas separated thousands of kilometres from one another.   Frequency and disaster patterns Certain types of natural disasters are more likely to occur in specific geographic regions, and in some places these events occur with seasonal regularity, as in the spring tornado season in the United States or the summer-and-fall hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are most frequent near tectonic plate boundaries, and an especially active boundary exists between the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO)—a United Nations (UN) agency that monitors Earth’s land, water, and atmosphere—reported in 2021 that the number of natural disasters per decade showed a fivefold increase from 1979 to 2019, and data collected in the EM-DAT, an international disaster database maintained by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, Brussels, indicate that more than 300 disasters have been tallied each year since 1998. Though many natural disasters are neither preventable nor largely predictable, the WMO report notes that global warming—an increasingly human-driven phenomenon generated by the emission of greenhouse gases, specifically those released by the combustion of fossil fuels—is increasing the frequency of weather- and climate-related natural disasters, such as droughts, heat waves, increasingly intense hurricanes, and flooding due to sea-level rise. Warmer temperatures are causing more extreme weather events by delivering more precipitation to some areas—which may be unused to receiving heavy rains and snows, increasing flooding risk—while delivering less to other areas that rely on it, increasing drought risk. In addition, reliable sources of rainfall, such as the South Asian monsoon, on which agriculture of the Indian subcontinent has long depended, are becoming less predictable, and rain events have become more violent and dangerous, damaging crops and producing more intense flooding. This change has subjected some areas under the monsoon’s influence to extended drought conditions, whereas other areas receive too much rainfall, a pattern that scientists predict will worsen in the 21st century.   Damage and deaths SuperdomeAerial views of downtown New Orleans, Louisiana, with the Superdome in the foreground: (left) on August 30, 2005, a day after Hurricane Katrina struck the city, and (right) again some 10 years later on July 29, 2015.(more)The costs of individual natural disasters frequently reach the tens of billions of dollars. Such costs may be associated with damage to crops, buildings, and infrastructure that occurs annually in areas prone to tropical cyclone activity or heavy seasonal rains, with some events, such as the Pakistan floods of 2022 and Hurricane Katrina (which struck the southern United States in 2005), costing more than $30 billion and $186 billion, respectively. Similarly, costs associated with earthquakes, which occur less regularly, can be high (such as China’s Sichuan earthquake of 2008 and Japan’s Kōbe earthquake of 1995, which incurred costs estimated at more than $86 billion and more than $100 billion, respectively). The number of deaths from natural disasters also varies by location and the intensity of the event; however, the overall trend points to a decline from several hundreds of thousands of deaths annually during the first half of the 20th century to roughly 45,000 deaths globally each year. The number of deaths also varies widely from year to year, with smaller natural disasters (or natural disasters occurring in areas far from human settlement) killing few and shockingly large disasters producing truly massive losses of life. Some of the most notable catastrophic disasters in history include the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 (which killed more than 225,000 people), the Tangshan earthquake of 1976 (which resulted in more than 242,000 deaths), the 2010 Haiti earthquake (which by some estimates may have killed at least 300,000 people), and China’s Shaanxi province earthquake of 1556 (which killed more than 800,000 people). Although deaths from natural disasters have decreased overall, people in lower-income countries often suffer disproportionately, because these locations have fewer resources and thus greater vulnerability to the elements and to food insecurity. In contrast, highly developed countries have better infrastructure (for communications, evacuation procedures, the movement of resources, and the delivery of medical services). In addition, high-income countries can implement policies that limit construction in flood-prone areas or mandate the construction of more earthquake-resistant homes, office buildings, and other structures, thereby reducing the risk of crushing injury and death stemming from building collapses. Consequently, relatively few people die from earthquakes in California, a location well-known for its strong building codes with respect to withstanding earthquakes, compared with places such as Iran and Pakistan, where building codes are either less stringent or whose codes frequently go unenforced.   Disaster warning systems Doppler radarDoppler radars, such as this one operated by the U.S. National Weather Service at New Underwood, South Dakota, extract the Doppler frequency shift of the echo produced by a moving target by noting how much the frequency of the received signal differs from the frequency of the signal that was transmitted.(more)Advances in weather forecasting and advances in land-based seismic sensors and sensors placed aboard satellites, aircraft, and stationary buoys floating in the world’s oceans have led to the development of various kinds of early warning systems. In some cases, these systems are capable of predicting or accurately classifying the strength of the physical forces that generate natural disasters before they cause damage. The perhaps most widespread and best known of these systems are those used by national weather bureaus that classify, track, and predict various weather events and issue bulletins about storms and other weather and climate phenomena affecting their land areas and sea zones. National weather bureaus are often made up of a network of numerous local offices spread across a country that gauge local weather conditions several times per day. Data collected by these offices can be used to develop weather models that help to predict the strength of a storm, as well as its location, days in advance of its arrival in a local area. In addition, specialized units within national governments—such as the China Earthquake Administration, the Japan Meteorological Agency, the United Kingdom’s Met Office, India’s National Center of Seismology, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Geological Survey—monitor specific physical forces capable of causing the most damaging and deadly natural disasters (that is, earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, flooding, and winds driven by tornadoes and tropical cyclones). Many of these organizations within specific countries cooperate with their counterparts in others or assist international organizations, such as the WMO and the International Tsunami Information Center, to issue warnings, develop international safety standards, and assess the risks associated with forces that affect several countries or the planet as a whole. Some early warning systems even look beyond Earth’s atmosphere; the near-Earth objects system operated by the European Space Agency and the Scout and Sentry impact hazard systems run by NASA in the United States are a few of several systems designed to detect, track, and predict the risk associated with asteroids, comets, and other extraterrestrial objects capable of striking Earth.","natural disaster, any calamitous occurrence generated by the effects of natural, rather than human-driven, phenomena that produces great loss of human life or destruction of the natural environment, private property, or public infrastructure.

Train driver strike called

On Tuesday, a train driver died and 37 people were injured when a commuter service hit a retaining wall that fell onto the tracks near Barcelona in the northeastern region of Catalonia.

The second accident, believed to have been a consequence of recent heavy rainfall, prompted the suspension on Wednesday of all of the wealthy region's main Rodalies commuter network, used by hundreds of thousands of people, while safety checks were carried out.

Rodalies services were expected to resume on Thursday but remained suspended as only six of 140 drivers reported for work, said Catalan regional government spokeswoman Silvia Paneque.

Service will resume after inspections involving the drivers, she said, with no date set.

The secretary general of the Semaf train driver union, Diego Martin Fernandez, told RAC 1 radio that a thorough review of infrastructure had been agreed but that ""the procedure had not been respected"".

""To restore confidence that the infrastructure meets safety conditions, we need guarantees,"" he said, denouncing fresh landslips on the lines.

Semaf has called a national strike for February 9 to 11, denouncing repeated safety failings.

Transport Minister Oscar Puente vowed to negotiate to have the strike called off and said the two tragedies were unrelated, defending the public transport system.

The list of incidents grew on Thursday after a commuter train in the southeastern region of Murcia hit a crane mounted on a truck, causing six light injuries.

Murcia emergency services said the victims were taken to a hospital after the accident in the municipality of Alumbres, where the train did not derail.

The mayor of the nearby city of Cartagena, Noelia Arroyo, wrote on social media that the electricity company truck was working on cables belonging to a building next to the track.

Mo. State Rep. Ann Kelly released a statement saying the two trains did not contain hazardous materials. She has spoken with CPKC (Canadian Pacific Kansas City formerly Kansas City Southern) officials who are working with MoDOT and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).
We observed on scene Friday massive equipment working non-stop on removal and repair.
“CPKC train carrying grain made contact with another freight train stopped in a low-speed siding track [adjacent] to the main line in a rural area north of Burgess, Mo.”
— Mo. State Rep.127th Dist. Ann Kelly (R) of Lamar, Mo.
Burgess is a small unincorporated town, directly across the state line from Mulberry, Kan. They form a contiguous populous split by the state line.
The train crash is located 2 1/2 miles north of Burgess. Or 1/2 mile south of NW 60th Road. Roughly five miles from Liberal, Mo. and 5 1/2 miles from Arcadia, Kan.
Two tanker cars derailed on the stationary train. They contained a form of heavy bitumen, comparative to asphalt.
A grain hopper car derailed on the other train, grain spilling out, along with a locomotive.
CPKC contractors began arriving Friday afternoon to the area to work on the clean-up. There is no known estimate on when it will be completed. For now the main line is not operating through the area.
The cause of the derailment is under investigation.

No trains are running on the Metra Southwest Service line after a freight train derailed early Wednesday morning.
It could take a couple days to clean up the mess in Chicago Ridge. According to police, the train derailed near Ridgeland Avenue and Central Avenue. No injuries were reported.
Heavy equipment has been working at the scene for hours as of Wednesday afternoon; they've even had to clear away some trees to get to the derailed cars.
Two train crossings are closed as of Wednesday evening, and officials expect it's more likely that the crossing at Ridgeland Avenue and 102nd Place will be the first to reopen.
""107th and Central Ave., which is located in Oak Lawn will be down for a couple of days. There's some road damage there as the train did come off the tracks there and start pulling roadway up there,"" said Oak Lawn Fire Chief David Wheeler.
People who live nearby said they heard the derailment this morning.
""I didn't know what it was. I thought it was an accident. I looked outside and I didn't see anything, so I just assumed it might be a derailment,"" said neighbor Bruce Greinke.
About a dozen cars went off the track.
CBS Chicago traffic reporter Kris Habermehl recommends commuters use the Rock Island and Heritage Corridor as alternate Metra routes.
Ridgeland Avenue remains closed between Southwest Highway and Washington Street. Central Avenue is closed at the railroad tracks between 107th Street and Pleasant.
Chicago Ridge Mayor John ""Jack"" Lind said he was contacted immediately by local officials after the derailment.
""Since our town is basically landlocked by train tracks, they have been more than helpful, and they are doing their best to clear the tracks.
Lind said the tracks will be closed for an ""indeterminate amount of time.""
It was not immediately clear when Metra service to and from Chicago Ridge would resume. Commuters should plan alternate routes and check Metra.com for updates.","No trains are running on the Metra Southwest Service line after a freight train derailed early Wednesday morning.

The back-to-back disasters in January shocked the country and raised doubts about the safety of train travel in Spain, which boasts one of the world's most extensive high-speed rail networks.
""The entire state is doing -- and will continue to do -- everything possible to support the injured and the victims' families, clarify the causes of the accident, and, if necessary, ensure justice is done,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Spain's rail system ""is not perfect, but it is safe"", he added, vowing to take all necessary measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
Shock hit the rail sector after a collision between two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia on January 18 resulted in the death of 46 people -- one of Europe's deadliest such disasters this century.
Two days later, a commuter train in the Barcelona region ploughed into the rubble of a collapsed wall following heavy rain, killing the driver and injuring dozens.
The government reached a deal with railway unions on Monday to invest 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to improve maintenance, create 3,650 jobs, and strengthen public rail safety.
The agreement prompted unions to call off a three-day strike.
The conservative opposition has called for Sanchez's resignation, blaming the accidents on underinvestment in maintenance and understaffing.
Popular Party (PP) chief Alberto Nunez Feijoo accused the government in parliament of having ""played Russian roulette with our safety"".
He said the accident in Andalusia was ""preventable, not an unforeseeable catastrophe"" and blasted the government for not apologising and ""taking responsibility"".
The head of far-right Vox, Santiago Abascal, called it ""a crime and not just an accident"".
""A crime that will weigh on your consciences and for which I hope you will answer before the courts,"" he added.
- 'Much to improve' -
A preliminary report suggested the track may have been cracked before the catastrophe in Andalusia.
Concerns over Spain’s rail network come as Sanchez faces several corruption scandals in his inner circle that have weakened his fragile minority coalition.
His Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in a regional election in Aragon on Sunday, following their worst-ever regional result in their former stronghold, Extremadura, in December.
In both elections the PP came on top while Vox made huge gains.
Private operators began running passenger trains in Spain in 2021 following the liberalisation of the rail sector, ending Renfe's decades-long monopoly.
Since then, passenger numbers on some routes have grown noticeably, but the unions say investment in maintenance has not kept up.
But Sanchez said his government had nearly tripled investment in railway infrastructure since it came to power in 2018.
He accused the previous PP government of underinvestment in the national rail network which he said carries over 12 million passengers each week.

The back-to-back disasters in January shocked the country and raised doubts about the safety of train travel in Spain, which boasts one of the world's most extensive high-speed rail networks.
""The entire state is doing -- and will continue to do -- everything possible to support the injured and the victims' families, clarify the causes of the accident, and, if necessary, ensure justice is done,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Spain's rail system ""is not perfect, but it is safe"", he added, vowing to take all necessary measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
Shock hit the rail sector after a collision between two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia on January 18 resulted in the death of 46 people -- one of Europe's deadliest such disasters this century.
Two days later, a commuter train in the Barcelona region ploughed into the rubble of a collapsed wall following heavy rain, killing the driver and injuring dozens.
The government reached a deal with railway unions on Monday to invest 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to improve maintenance, create 3,650 jobs, and strengthen public rail safety.
The agreement prompted unions to call off a three-day strike.
The conservative opposition has called for Sanchez's resignation, blaming the accidents on underinvestment in maintenance and understaffing.
Popular Party (PP) chief Alberto Nunez Feijoo accused the government in parliament of having ""played Russian roulette with our safety"".
He said the accident in Andalusia was ""preventable, not an unforeseeable catastrophe"" and blasted the government for not apologising and ""taking responsibility"".
The head of far-right Vox, Santiago Abascal, called it ""a crime and not just an accident"".
""A crime that will weigh on your consciences and for which I hope you will answer before the courts,"" he added.
- 'Much to improve' -
A preliminary report suggested the track may have been cracked before the catastrophe in Andalusia.
Concerns over Spain’s rail network come as Sanchez faces several corruption scandals in his inner circle that have weakened his fragile minority coalition.
His Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in a regional election in Aragon on Sunday, following their worst-ever regional result in their former stronghold, Extremadura, in December.
In both elections the PP came on top while Vox made huge gains.
Private operators began running passenger trains in Spain in 2021 following the liberalisation of the rail sector, ending Renfe's decades-long monopoly.
Since then, passenger numbers on some routes have grown noticeably, but the unions say investment in maintenance has not kept up.
But Sanchez said his government had nearly tripled investment in railway infrastructure since it came to power in 2018.
He accused the previous PP government of underinvestment in the national rail network which he said carries over 12 million passengers each week.
""There is still work to be done, without a doubt, and much to improve,"" Sanchez told lawmakers.

If an elected official resigns but then stays in the seat, it sends mixed messages to voters.

2. Yes. You can’t have it both ways. Either you’re committed to running for mayor, or you’re not.

3. No. State law allows candidates to hold over, and it’s not wrong to take advantage of that.

4. No. The council needs an adequate number of members to function. They should stay on.

5. Unsure. It’s hard to say. The charter says they shouldn’t but state law says OK. Which is right?",,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent investigations into various rail accidents have cast a spotlight on critical safety lapses that could have been mitigated with stricter adherence to protocols, better communication, and technological upgrades. As the transportation sector evolves, these incidents underscore the pressing need for proactive safety measures rather than reactive fixes. From urban transit systems to sprawling freight corridors, the underlying issues often share common roots in procedural oversight, inadequate staff training, and outdated infrastructure.

With the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) releasing detailed reports, industry stakeholders and safety advocates are paying close attention. The findings reveal that despite advancements in safety technology, human error and procedural gaps continue to be significant contributors to accidents. The implications are far-reaching, ranging from passenger injuries to catastrophic derailments, and demand urgent action across all levels of rail management.

Critical Failures in Rail Signal and Protection Systems

The recent alarming incidents highlight the gaps in rail signal systems and protection procedures. In one case, a train approaching a busy station failed to receive adequate warning due to malfunctioning lights and delayed alerts, resulting in a near-miss that could have turned tragic. Investigators found that the control center lacked real-time monitoring, and maintenance schedules were significantly overdue. These systemic flaws reveal that safety depends heavily on regular maintenance, rigorous testing, and seamless communication between control operators and field staff.

Moreover, technological innovations such as automated signaling and rail sensors have not yet become universal standards. When these systems fail or are improperly calibrated, they create dangerous gaps, emphasizing the importance of continuous upgrades and staff training to recognize and respond to anomalies promptly.

Human Error and Procedural Gaps as Common Denominators

Many recent incidents point directly to human error or procedural lapses. For instance, an accident at Stockton Limán involved a railcar that was derailed during a rescue operation. Investigators determined that the crew lacked a clear standard operating procedure for handling such emergencies, leading to inconsistent responses and increased risk. The absence of standardized protocols leaves room for discretion, which can be perilous in high-stakes situations.

Furthermore, crew fatigue, miscommunication, and misunderstanding of safety signals compound the problem. Proper training programs and routine drills are essential to foster a safety-first culture, but many organizations still fall short in implementing comprehensive educational initiatives.

Safety Equipment and Infrastructure Deficiencies

Modern safety equipment like crash absorbers, advanced brake systems, and sensor-based warnings significantly reduce the impact of inevitable accidents. However, many rail lines operate with outdated gear, especially in less-funded freight corridors or older urban transit systems. The recent reports suggest that infrastructure retrofitting is more of an exception than a rule, leaving critical points vulnerable.

Equipment failures, such as ineffective buffers or failed switch mechanisms, have been directly linked to derailments and collisions. Consistent inspection routines and investment in high-tech safety infrastructure are crucial to prevent such failures from escalating into disasters.

Lessons from Major Incidents and How to Prevent Future Tragedies

Analyzing incidents like the near-miss at Atlanta or the train-truck collision in North Dakota offers vital lessons. First, implementing automated safety systems that do not rely solely on human intervention can drastically reduce errors. Examples include automatic train stop systems and AI-powered monitoring for real-time anomaly detection.

Second, establishing a robust safety culture within rail organizations is indispensable. This involves fostering an environment where staff feel empowered to report hazards without fear of reprisal, ensuring that issues are addressed proactively rather than reactively.

Third, comprehensive education and continuous education are non-negotiable. Regular drills, scenario-based training, and updated safety manuals help prepare crews for unforeseen circumstances, minimizing the reliance on intuition during emergencies.

The Role of Technology and Future Strategies

Looking ahead, the integration of emerging technologies can revolutionize rail safety. Intelligent sensors, IoT-enabled infrastructure, and AI-driven analytics can offer predictive maintenance and early warning systems. Such innovations create an environment where problems are identified and addressed long before they materialize into accidents.

However, technology alone cannot solve all issues. Equal emphasis must be placed on staff training, regulatory oversight, and infrastructure investments. Governments and rail companies must collaborate to establish universally accepted safety standards, mandatory upgrade timelines, and transparent reporting mechanisms.

Addressing Regulatory and Oversight Challenges

Many of the incidents are underscored by a lack of rigorous regulatory enforcement, especially among smaller operators. Strengthening oversight and ensuring compliance with safety protocols are critical for national safety standards. Regular audits, penalty enforcement, and incentive for safety improvements can motivate companies to prioritize safety infrastructure upgrades.

Public awareness campaigns also play a role in emphasizing the importance of safety rules at crossings and near rail tracks, reducing preventable accidents caused by pedestrian or vehicle negligence.

Conclusion

While technological advancements have significantly improved rail safety, recurring incidents reveal that human factors, procedural gaps, and infrastructure deficiencies still pose significant risks. The recent NTSB reports serve as a stark reminder: continuous vigilance, investment, and a safety-conscious culture are essential to prevent future tragedies. Building a safer rail system relentless demands pursuit of innovation, strict regulatory compliance, and a mindset that prioritizes safety as a fundamental operational principle.",tf_html,"Unraveling the Latest Rail Incidents and Safety Failures

Equipment failures, such as ineffective buffers or failed switch mechanisms, have been directly linked to derailments and collisions. Consistent inspection routines and investment in high-tech safety infrastructure are crucial to prevent such failures from escalating into disasters.

Lessons from Major Incidents and How to Prevent Future Tragedies

Analyzing incidents like the near-miss at Atlanta or the train-truck collision in North Dakota offers vital lessons. First, implementing automated safety systems that do not rely solely on human intervention can drastically reduce errors. Examples include automatic train stop systems and AI-powered monitoring for real-time anomaly detection.

Second, establishing a robust safety culture within rail organizations is indispensable. This involves fostering an environment where staff feel empowered to report hazards without fear of reprisal, ensuring that issues are addressed proactively rather than reactively.

Third, comprehensive education and continuous education are non-negotiable. Regular drills, scenario-based training, and updated safety manuals help prepare crews for unforeseen circumstances, minimizing the reliance on intuition during emergencies.

The Role of Technology and Future Strategies

Looking ahead, the integration of emerging technologies can revolutionize rail safety. Intelligent sensors, IoT-enabled infrastructure, and AI-driven analytics can offer predictive maintenance and early warning systems. Such innovations create an environment where problems are identified and addressed long before they materialize into accidents.

However, technology alone cannot solve all issues. Equal emphasis must be placed on staff training, regulatory oversight, and infrastructure investments. Governments and rail companies must collaborate to establish universally accepted safety standards, mandatory upgrade timelines, and transparent reporting mechanisms.

Many of the incidents are underscored by a lack of rigorous regulatory enforcement, especially among smaller operators. Strengthening oversight and ensuring compliance with safety protocols are critical for national safety standards. Regular audits, penalty enforcement, and incentive for safety improvements can motivate companies to prioritize safety infrastructure upgrades.

Public awareness campaigns also play a role in emphasizing the importance of safety rules at crossings and near rail tracks, reducing preventable accidents caused by pedestrian or vehicle negligence.

While technological advancements have significantly improved rail safety, recurring incidents reveal that human factors, procedural gaps, and infrastructure deficiencies still pose significant risks. The recent NTSB reports serve as a stark reminder: continuous vigilance, investment, and a safety-conscious culture are essential to prevent future tragedies. Building a safer rail system relentless demands pursuit of innovation, strict regulatory compliance, and a mindset that prioritizes safety as a fundamental operational principle.",1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,gs_html,1800-01-01

Zip Code","Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez vowed Wednesday that justice would be done following two train accidents that claimed 47 lives last month, and insisted the country's rail system ""is safe"".
The back-to-back disasters in January shocked the country and raised doubts about the safety of train travel in Spain, which boasts one of the world's most extensive high-speed rail networks.
""The entire state is doing -- and will continue to do -- everything possible to support the injured and the victims' families, clarify the causes of the accident, and, if necessary, ensure justice is done,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Spain's rail system ""is not perfect, but it is safe"", he added, vowing to take all necessary measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
Shock hit the rail sector after a collision between two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia on January 18 resulted in the death of 46 people -- one of Europe's deadliest such disasters this century.
Two days later, a commuter train in the Barcelona region ploughed into the rubble of a collapsed wall following heavy rain, killing the driver and injuring dozens.
The government reached a deal with railway unions on Monday to invest 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to improve maintenance, create 3,650 jobs, and strengthen public rail safety.
The agreement prompted unions to call off a three-day strike.
The conservative opposition has called for Sanchez's resignation, blaming the accidents on underinvestment in maintenance and understaffing.
Popular Party (PP) chief Alberto Nunez Feijoo accused the government in parliament of having ""played Russian roulette with our safety"".
He said the accident in Andalusia was ""preventable, not an unforeseeable catastrophe"" and blasted the government for not apologising and ""taking responsibility"".
The head of far-right Vox, Santiago Abascal, called it ""a crime and not just an accident"".
""A crime that will weigh on your consciences and for which I hope you will answer before the courts,"" he added.
- 'Much to improve' -
A preliminary report suggested the track may have been cracked before the catastrophe in Andalusia.
Concerns over Spain’s rail network come as Sanchez faces several corruption scandals in his inner circle that have weakened his fragile minority coalition.
His Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in a regional election in Aragon on Sunday, following their worst-ever regional result in their former stronghold, Extremadura, in December.
In both elections the PP came on top while Vox made huge gains.
Private operators began running passenger trains in Spain in 2021 following the liberalisation of the rail sector, ending Renfe's decades-long monopoly.
Since then, passenger numbers on some routes have grown noticeably, but the unions say investment in maintenance has not kept up.
But Sanchez said his government had nearly tripled investment in railway infrastructure since it came to power in 2018.
He accused the previous PP government of underinvestment in the national rail network which he said carries over 12 million passengers each week.

Westley, California – A multi-vehicle collision involving six vehicles, among them a semi-truck, resulted in the death of a pickup truck driver Tuesday afternoon on southbound Interstate 5 in Stanislaus County, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Authorities arrived at the scene shortly before 4:15 p.m. on the southbound side of I-5, just north of Ingram Creek Road near Westley.

Investigators say the pickup was traveling in the slow lane when it struck the side of an SUV that was stopped on the right shoulder. The impact forced that SUV into another nearby SUV. The pickup continued forward and clipped two more vehicles — both sedans — before ultimately crashing into the rear of a stopped Freightliner truck.

Emergency responders pronounced the pickup driver dead at the scene. No other injuries were reported.

CHP stated that the pickup driver was not wearing a seat belt. It remains under investigation whether alcohol or drugs played a role in the incident.

Several southbound lanes were temporarily closed while crews handled the scene and cleared debris. All lanes were reopened shortly before 7:45 p.m.

Who Pays Damages After a Multi-Vehicle Fatal Crash?

In a multi-vehicle fatal crash, financial responsibility is determined by fault. Investigators and insurance companies analyze how the chain reaction started, which drivers acted negligently, and whether more than one party contributed to the collision. Damages may be paid by a single at-fault driver, shared among multiple drivers under comparative negligence rules, or partially covered by commercial policies if a truck or business vehicle was involved. Compensation in fatal cases is typically pursued through a wrongful death claim filed by surviving family members.

Because liability in pileups is often disputed — with conflicting statements, overlapping impacts, and multiple insurers involved — families should speak with a qualified car accident lawyer near Sacramento as soon as possible. A skilled personal injury lawyer in the Sacramento area can gather crash reports, vehicle data, and expert analysis to determine who must pay. When a life is lost, a wrongful death lawyer near Sacramento can help surviving relatives pursue damages for funeral costs, lost income, and loss of companionship.

The back-to-back disasters in January shocked the country and raised doubts about the safety of train travel in Spain, which boasts one of the world's most extensive high-speed rail networks.
""The entire state is doing -- and will continue to do -- everything possible to support the injured and the victims' families, clarify the causes of the accident, and, if necessary, ensure justice is done,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Spain's rail system ""is not perfect, but it is safe"", he added, vowing to take all necessary measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
Shock hit the rail sector after a collision between two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia on January 18 resulted in the death of 46 people -- one of Europe's deadliest such disasters this century.
Two days later, a commuter train in the Barcelona region ploughed into the rubble of a collapsed wall following heavy rain, killing the driver and injuring dozens.
The government reached a deal with railway unions on Monday to invest 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to improve maintenance, create 3,650 jobs, and strengthen public rail safety.
The agreement prompted unions to call off a three-day strike.
The conservative opposition has called for Sanchez's resignation, blaming the accidents on underinvestment in maintenance and understaffing.
Popular Party (PP) chief Alberto Nunez Feijoo accused the government in parliament of having ""played Russian roulette with our safety"".
He said the accident in Andalusia was ""preventable, not an unforeseeable catastrophe"" and blasted the government for not apologising and ""taking responsibility"".
The head of far-right Vox, Santiago Abascal, called it ""a crime and not just an accident"".
""A crime that will weigh on your consciences and for which I hope you will answer before the courts,"" he added.
- 'Much to improve' -
A preliminary report suggested the track may have been cracked before the catastrophe in Andalusia.
Concerns over Spain’s rail network come as Sanchez faces several corruption scandals in his inner circle that have weakened his fragile minority coalition.
His Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in a regional election in Aragon on Sunday, following their worst-ever regional result in their former stronghold, Extremadura, in December.
In both elections the PP came on top while Vox made huge gains.
Private operators began running passenger trains in Spain in 2021 following the liberalisation of the rail sector, ending Renfe's decades-long monopoly.
Since then, passenger numbers on some routes have grown noticeably, but the unions say investment in maintenance has not kept up.
But Sanchez said his government had nearly tripled investment in railway infrastructure since it came to power in 2018.
He accused the previous PP government of underinvestment in the national rail network which he said carries over 12 million passengers each week.
""There is still work to be done, without a doubt, and much to improve,"" Sanchez told lawmakers.

The back-to-back disasters in January shocked the country and raised doubts about the safety of train travel in Spain, which boasts one of the world's most extensive high-speed rail networks.
""The entire state is doing -- and will continue to do -- everything possible to support the injured and the victims' families, clarify the causes of the accident, and, if necessary, ensure justice is done,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Spain's rail system ""is not perfect, but it is safe"", he added, vowing to take all necessary measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
Shock hit the rail sector after a collision between two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia on January 18 resulted in the death of 46 people -- one of Europe's deadliest such disasters this century.
Two days later, a commuter train in the Barcelona region ploughed into the rubble of a collapsed wall following heavy rain, killing the driver and injuring dozens.
The government reached a deal with railway unions on Monday to invest 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to improve maintenance, create 3,650 jobs, and strengthen public rail safety.
The agreement prompted unions to call off a three-day strike.
The conservative opposition has called for Sanchez's resignation, blaming the accidents on underinvestment in maintenance and understaffing.
Popular Party (PP) chief Alberto Nunez Feijoo accused the government in parliament of having ""played Russian roulette with our safety"".
He said the accident in Andalusia was ""preventable, not an unforeseeable catastrophe"" and blasted the government for not apologising and ""taking responsibility"".
The head of far-right Vox, Santiago Abascal, called it ""a crime and not just an accident"".
""A crime that will weigh on your consciences and for which I hope you will answer before the courts,"" he added.
- 'Much to improve' -
A preliminary report suggested the track may have been cracked before the catastrophe in Andalusia.
Concerns over Spain’s rail network come as Sanchez faces several corruption scandals in his inner circle that have weakened his fragile minority coalition.
His Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in a regional election in Aragon on Sunday, following their worst-ever regional result in their former stronghold, Extremadura, in December.
In both elections the PP came on top while Vox made huge gains.
Private operators began running passenger trains in Spain in 2021 following the liberalisation of the rail sector, ending Renfe's decades-long monopoly.
Since then, passenger numbers on some routes have grown noticeably, but the unions say investment in maintenance has not kept up.
But Sanchez said his government had nearly tripled investment in railway infrastructure since it came to power in 2018.
He accused the previous PP government of underinvestment in the national rail network which he said carries over 12 million passengers each week.

Neither drivers nor pedestrians will ever use this structure—a modern infrastructure irony, where priorities shift faster than the dollar’s exchange rate. Authorities insist the bridge will save lives, but not human ones. At a time when every dollar counts, decisions like this spark not only surprise, but also a flood of sarcastic comments.

Instead of the usual concrete paths and railings, a green corridor designed exclusively for animals will appear here. The Wallis Annenberg Bridge, spanning the ten-lane US 101 between Calabasas and Westlake Village, is intended to become a lifeline for local wildlife, long trapped by American highways. For mountain lions, coyotes, and deer, attempting to cross the busy road has been a one-way ticket. Now, under the officials’ plan, animals are getting a chance at survival—and people, a new topic for kitchen-table debate.

Skeptics never tire of pointing out that, amid economic pressure and social issues, spending millions on a bridge for animals is a luxury fit only for Hollywood. But project supporters counter that it’s about necessity, not whim. Ecosystems split by highways lead to species extinction, and collisions with animals cost the budget millions every year—including human fatalities. The only question is, who’s willing to believe that a bridge made of earth and shrubs can really change the situation.

Ecological Paradox

A large-scale construction project in California has become a symbol of a new era, where caring for nature sometimes appears to challenge common sense. The Wallis Annenberg Bridge looks nothing like typical engineering structures: its surface will be layered with soil and planted with native vegetation so that animals won’t notice the trick. For them, it will feel less like a bridge and more like a seamless extension of the forest, allowing them to safely cross a dangerous highway without risking their lives.

Noise barriers and special lighting shields will be installed along the structure to minimize stress for wildlife. Human presence is strictly forbidden: no bike lanes, no observation points, not even paths for curious tourists. All of this is meant to return to nature what was taken from it decades ago.

Nevertheless, despite its noble intentions, the project has become a target for criticism. Debates continue on social media and during public hearings: is the wildlife bridge truly an investment in the future, or just another attempt to spend money on questionable initiatives? For local authorities, however, the answer is clear: safety and biodiversity preservation outweigh skepticism.

The Price of Survival

The issue of habitat fragmentation in the United States is particularly acute. Tens of thousands of kilometers of roads cut through ecosystems, turning them into isolated islands. As a result, animal populations deteriorate, and rare species are pushed to the brink of extinction. In the Santa Monica Mountains, the situation is critical: local pumas are already teetering on the edge of extinction due to the inability to migrate.

Every year, thousands of animals die under the wheels of cars, and drivers face not only stress but also hefty repair bills. The Wallis Annenberg Bridge is set to become the first step toward restoring natural connectivity. The idea is to allow animals to safely move between fragmented habitats, reducing collisions and preserving genetic diversity.

Supporters of the project insist that the investment will pay off not only in saved animal lives, but also by reducing accident-related expenses. Moreover, successful implementation could serve as a model for other regions facing similarly urgent wildlife collision issues.

Between skepticism and hope

While some call the bridge a ‘monument to absurdity,’ others see it as a symbol of change. California authorities emphasize that the project is not merely a gesture of goodwill, but an attempt to correct past mistakes. Human activity has long upset the balance between urbanization and nature, and now unconventional solutions are required.

Interest in the experiment is being shown not only by American states, but also by foreign countries. If the bridge meets expectations, similar structures may appear around the world. However, for now, the main criterion for success is not the number of cars that have passed over it, but the traces of animal paw prints on the soft ground.

The question of whether such investments are justified will remain open for some time. Yet it is already clear: California has chosen to remind everyone that progress does not always mean new roads for people—it can also mean giving animals a chance not to be crushed under the wheels of civilization.

The Wallis Annenberg Bridge is a unique example of how infrastructure projects can transform not only the landscape, but also society’s perception of nature. Named after the renowned philanthropist, it has become a symbol of the effort to restore the lost harmony between humans and the environment. In the coming years, this bridge will determine just how far modern societies are willing to go to preserve biodiversity and ensure road safety.","A heated debate is unfolding in California over a massive bridge that cost the budget 19 million dollars, yet will remain permanently closed to people.

Supporters of the project insist that the investment will pay off not only in saved animal lives, but also by reducing accident-related expenses. Moreover, successful implementation could serve as a model for other regions facing similarly urgent wildlife collision issues.
Between skepticism and hope
While some call the bridge a ‘monument to absurdity,’ others see it as a symbol of change. California authorities emphasize that the project is not merely a gesture of goodwill, but an attempt to correct past mistakes.

Interest in the experiment is being shown not only by American states, but also by foreign countries. If the bridge meets expectations, similar structures may appear around the world. However, for now, the main criterion for success is not the number of cars that have passed over it, but the traces of animal paw prints on the soft ground.

She was flown to Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus with unspecified injuries. The incident remains under investigation.

Authorities said Dalton McMillen was struck by a CSX train at approximately 8:40 p.m. at the Kenton Avenue crossing. McMillen was pronounced dead at the scene.

MARION, OH, February 13, 2026 — A pedestrian train accident Friday night in Marion resulted in the death of a 33-year-old man and left a 12-year-old girl injured, according to police.

FATAL PEDESTRIAN TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Train-related accidents may occur for a variety of reasons, including errors by train personnel, track defects, mechanical malfunctions, signal system failures, or reckless behavior.

According to the National Transportation Safety Bureau, approximately 1,000 people are killed in train-related accidents each year. As part of the investigation, officials will also review whether the crossing was properly secured and safe for pedestrian use.

Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, emphasized that in cases like this, it is critical to conduct an independent investigation as soon as possible to preserve evidence for the victim’s family.

“A knowledgeable attorney can help protect grieving families from powerful rail companies, which often deploy their own investigators to crash scenes and have significant resources to defend against liability,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal and a national analyst for Accident Injury News.

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

Depending on the outcome of the investigation, family members of Dalton McMillen may be eligible to pursue a wrongful death claim. Families of wrongful death victims may seek compensation for loss of love and companionship, emotional distress, and pain and suffering following a catastrophic accident.

“The emotional strain following the sudden loss of a loved one can be overwhelming,” said Stefano Formica, of counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand the challenges families face during these difficult times. A wrongful death attorney can remain informed about the official investigation and help ensure that families’ legal rights and best interests are protected.”

Additionally, the 12-year-old girl injured in the crash may have the right to pursue a personal injury claim to recover damages related to medical treatment, rehabilitation costs, pain and suffering, and emotional trauma.","MARION, OH, February 13, 2026 — A pedestrian train accident Friday night in Marion resulted in the death of a 33-year-old man and left a 12-year-old girl injured, according to police.

Local Context

The incident occurred along the coastal railroad corridor between Lookout Park and Fernald Point near Summerland in Santa Barbara County. This stretch of track runs close to shoreline communities and recreational areas, including Lookout Park, and is used regularly by freight and passenger trains traveling through the region. When a train-related injury is reported in this area, responders from agencies such as the Montecito Fire Protection District must coordinate access along the tracks, which can be more difficult than roadway incidents. Temporary rail shutdowns may also affect service schedules while authorities secure the scene and conduct their investigation.

What to Do Next

If you witness a rail-related emergency, call 911 immediately and provide the exact location, including nearby landmarks such as Lookout Park or Fernald Point. Remain at a safe distance from railroad tracks and avoid attempting to approach or assist unless directed by emergency personnel. Write down what you observed, including train direction and timing, while the details are still fresh. Check official transit or rail advisories for updates if you plan to travel through the affected corridor.

A: Early information is often preliminary while investigators review scene evidence, speak with train operators and witnesses, and confirm the sequence of events.

Q: Are train-pedestrian crashes typically severe?

A: Collisions involving trains often result in serious injuries due to the size and speed of rail equipment, which can limit stopping distance.

Q: Can railroad operations be suspended after an incident?

A: Yes. Rail traffic may be temporarily halted so emergency crews can safely assist victims and investigators can examine the scene before service resumes.","Santa Barbara County, CA (February 12, 2026) – A man was seriously injured after being struck by a freight train between Lookout Park and Fernald Point near Summerland on Tuesday, February 10, just after 5 p.m., according to authorities.

Local Context
The incident occurred along the coastal railroad corridor between Lookout Park and Fernald Point near Summerland in Santa Barbara County. This stretch of track runs close to shoreline communities and recreational areas, including Lookout Park, and is used regularly by freight and passenger trains traveling through the region. When a train-related injury is reported in this area, responders from agencies such as the Montecito Fire Protection District must coordinate access along the tracks, which can be more difficult than roadway incidents. Temporary rail shutdowns may also affect service schedules while authorities secure the scene and conduct their investigation.
What to Do Next
- If you witness a rail-related emergency, call 911 immediately and provide the exact location, including nearby landmarks such as Lookout Park or Fernald Point.
- Remain at a safe distance from railroad tracks and avoid attempting to approach or assist unless directed by emergency personnel.
- Write down what you observed, including train direction and timing, while the details are still fresh.
- Check official transit or rail advisories for updates if you plan to travel through the affected corridor.

Group of UBCO students hopes to relaunch a Kelowna community fridge Reviving community fridge Photo: Jaims Cox The Kelowna Community Fridge was closed after vandalism at the previous location along Lawrence Avenue. A group of students is trying to revive the Kelowna Community Fridge. The fridge has been stocked with free items for those experiencing food insecurity. It first opened at the headquarters of the Kelowna Unitarians on Bertram Street in spring 2021. It was then moved to outside Burke Hair Lounge on Lawrence Avenue in early 2023. However, the fridge shut down a couple of years ago due to repeated vandalism and other problems. Now, four students in the Bachelor of Sustainability program at UBC Okanagan (Thea Vermeulen, Madi Koch, Sydney Barnden, and Jolina Elsworth Larose) have come together with the goal of getting it up and running again. “Madi, one of the group members, she was part of the fridge when it was up and running, I believe in 2021. Since then, she’s always wanted to get it started again, and we have the opportunity to do it now, so she brought up the idea to us,” said Thea Vermeulen. “At this stage, we are focused on rebuilding the project thoughtfully and collaboratively, learning from past challenges while engaging local businesses, organizations, and residents in early conversations,” she added. Vermeulen said she and the other organizers plan to host a public meeting in the next couple of weeks to share more about the project and get community input. The biggest hurdle will be finding a new location for the fridge. “We’re currently still trying to figure out exactly where,” she said. “We’re hoping to have the fridge up in September of this year, so we’re still definitely taking a couple of months to just make sure we have everything set up before we open up the fridge.” Anyone interested in the project can email [email protected] or follow Kelowna Community Fridge on Instagram.

Kelowna BC SPCA Pet of the Week Pet of the week Madison Reeve This week's Kelowna SPCA Pet of the Week is Surf. This sweet girl came from a home with over 30 dogs and is very fearful of new situations. She is very friendly and warms up quickly with treats and encouragement and is very food motivated. Surf lived with other dogs and seems to be social with other dogs, which leads us to believe that she would love a resident canine companion.

First of three online events designed to strengthen women in all businesses Women will get TogetHER Photo: Contributed Okanagan College and WeBC have joined forces to help women in business. Two organizations that have always been there to support women in business are joining forces on a month-long project. Okanagan College and WeBC are launching TogetHER, a leadership and growth initiative designed to bring self-identifying women business owners, leaders and entrepreneurs together to strengthen innovation and collaboration across the Okanagan. “Okanagan College is committed to creating meaningful opportunities for women in every part of our economy, from skilled trades to innovation and enterprise,” Okanagan College trades and apprenticeship dean Caitlin Hartigan said in a press release. “TogetHER creates space for women-led businesses to connect, share expertise and build partnerships that can help support long-term success.” TogetHER will host the first of three online innovation exchanges on Wednesday, Feb. 18. An industry leader and Okanagan College representative will lead the events, which are designed to bring female business leaders together to share experiences, explore solutions and build networks. The initiative will culminate with the two-day TogetHER Women’s Leadership Summit on March 5 and 6 at Okanagan College’s Vernon campus. Female business owners, employers and community partners are invited to participate by enrolling in the innovation exchanges, attending the summit or engaging in mentorship activities.

Seasonal waterfront train, Dreamer Express, wraps up in Kelowna this weekend Festive train rides near end Madison Reeve Kelowna residents and visitors have one last chance to ride the Dreamer Express, a seasonal trackless electric train that has been offering scenic waterfront tours since its launch in December. The train, stationed at the Delta Grand Hotel, will conclude operations this weekend, running 35-minute rides along the city’s downtown waterfront. The 40-foot, 30-passenger train was founded by local entrepreneurs Andrea Strang of Juniper Tree Learning and Maegan Young of Purple Rhino Events. Each journey begins at “Delta Grand Central Station,” where a dedicated conductor welcomes passengers before they set off. “We’re offering seasonal train rides, and we would love for people to come down and enjoy downtown Kelowna,” Young said. “For each season, we change the experience. For this one, we have incorporated the Tourism Kelowna Centre, where we have the love locks and the tourism signage of Kelowna and Love.'' Strang says one of the highlights has been seeing the joy it brings to the community. “I’d say the best part is watching children run alongside and wave, seeing adults’ inner child come out, and the joy and genuine happiness that it brings to the downtown core of Kelowna.” Young said the Dreamer Express has plans for seasonal expansions and special events. “In the Easter time, we’ll be working with the Delta Grand and hopefully the City of Kelowna to have an Easter egg hunt and a full activation with games and fun for families,” she said. “Then our plans are to move it to the Westside Wine Trail to do a hop-on, hop-off wine ride, whether you’re going to be drinking at the wineries or just want to experience the beauty of the Okanagan.” More information on the Dreamer Express can be found here.

Kelowna company completes first airplane conversion of its kind Unique conversion at KF Photo: Contributed The newly configured Boeing 737-800 has space for cargo up front and passengers in back. Aviation history has been made in Kelowna. KF Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineers Inc., or AEI, completed the world’s first combination conversion of a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The newly certified plane features a forward cargo compartment with five pallet positions and a 90-passenger cabin in the rear section. The aircraft was completed and and delivered to Air Inuit in October. KF Aerospace engineered and integrated fire detection, halon-based fire suppression and advanced smoke-containment systems for the forward cargo section, while also modifying existing freighter-specific detection systems to meet combi-specific criteria. “This project reflects the ingenuity, dedication and deep technical expertise of our entire team,” KF Aerospace president Gregg Evjen said in a press release. “KF is proud to deliver a world-first solution that expands what’s possible in aircraft conversion and supports our customers’ complex operational needs.” The airplane meets the customer’s requirement for a large-capacity mixed-use aircraft, which means it carries both cargo and passengers. KF Aerospace also said the project shows the company’s ability to overcome the regulatory and engineering challenges that have historically limited combi aircraft development worldwide. “The achievement of the 737-800 combi underscores the power of a true partnership that KF and AEI have enjoyed over the course of three decades,” AEI senior vice-president Robert T. Convey said in a press release. “By combining AEI’s cargo door conversion expertise with KF’s engineering and operational strengths, we are able to deliver a world-first combi that unlocks new possibilities for operators worldwide.”

Kelowna immigration lawyer busy as Canada tightens border Immigration lawyers busy A Kelowna-based lawyer says his law firm's phone has been ringing off the hook with people seeking help with immigration issues as Canada tightens its borders. Upwards of 1.4 million temporary work permits are set to expire in Canada in 2026. At the same time, the country will only accept 380,000 permanent residency applications. Bryan Fitzpatrick, an immigration lawyer with Pushor Mitchell, says they have been “extremely busy” recently. “Because the number of options are narrower, people now are less apt to do it themselves or wanting to do it themselves, so they are reaching out to get legal advice,"" he told Kelowna city councillor Mohini Singh on her podcast Chai and Chat, which appears regularly on Castanet. Indian immigrants make up the largest portion of temporary workers in Canada, by far. Fitzpatrick said that is because they prioritize learning English in India, which gives them an advantage for entry. “It was the focus of the federal government to grow our population, in turn help grow the economy,” he said. But with unaffordable housing prices and a overburdened healthcare system, Fitzpatrick notes that moods have changes in both Ottawa and the public. “We have an economy that is slowing and an unemployment rate that is high, so there is political pressure to go and follow through and enforce the immigration laws,” he said. For those who still want to come to or stay in Canada, Fitzpatrick suggests studying or working in an in-demand field like healthcare. “Find an area that you can contribute.” But at the end of the day, he said, immigration policy is often fickle and governments often make changes to programs and intake stream. “You always need to be aware, that things can change and policies change, immigration changes rapidly, changes with a new government.” “Be proactive. Don’t wait until the last minute to try to understand what options are available to you."" He said they should also be open minded about taking different types of jobs.

Kelowna teen remembered as polite, active young man after fatal assault Aunt remembers slain teen Photo: Contributed Gordie Perreault, 18, killed in assault on January 24th Gordie Perreault is being remembered by his aunt Shanny Morris as a polite, active young man who loved hiking, fishing, and spending time with friends. Perreault, 18, was killed in a fatal assault on Saturday, Jan. 24, in Kelowna. RCMP say they were called at 8:20 p.m. to reports of “an assault between two groups” near Springfield and Benvoulin roads. Officers found the teen with life-threatening injuries. He was rushed to hospital by paramedics but later died. “I just want Gordie to be remembered as the young man who didn't like bullies. He was always polite, as I raised him to be. This is a huge shock for everyone around who knew Gordie,” Morris said. Morris raised Perreault since he was two years old after taking him in from the system, giving him a childhood full of outdoor activities. Police said the investigation remains on going, but did confirm the incident appears to have been targeted. Morris said she received the devastating news in person after officers told her it was urgent they meet. “It was a huge, huge shock for me,” she said. She added that she has been given little information about what led to Perreault's death. According to Morris, he attended Mount Boucherie Secondary School prior to his death. ''He needed a few more credits to get his diploma...he received the credits with encouragement from his teachers at the school. I thank them all for their support, kindness and encouragement for helping Gordie successfully achieve his grade 12 diploma."" Anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police is asked to contact the Kelowna RCMP at 250-762-3300. Those wishing to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or submit a tip online.

UBCO research show time-restricted eating shows promise for overweight people living with Crohn’s Fasting helps with Crohn's Photo: UBCO A new study has determined that intermittent fasting can help people with Crohn’s disease who are overweight. New research from the University of British Columbia, Okanagan and the University of Calgary shows intermittent fasting can help overweight people with Crohn’s disease. The research looked at how time-restricted eating could help people living with Crohn's, reduce symptoms and improve health benefits by changing when they ate as opposed to how much. Intermittent fasting has become a popular diet trend. But this new research collaboration between UBCO and the University of Calgary discovered it can also have health benefits for overweight people living with Crohn’s disease. UBCO clinical researcher, Dr. Natasha Haskey co-authored the study with Dr. Maitreyi Raman, an associate professor at the University of Calgary. The focus was on how overweight people with Crohn’s fared when they fasted for 16 hours a day but consumed their usual diet during the remaining eight hours of that same day. “We were curious whether this way of eating could improve symptoms, reduce visceral fat, which is fat around the organs, lower inflammation and support a healthier gut. And our preliminary research suggests it does,” says Dr. Haskey. Crohn’s disease can be complicated by excess visceral fat, which is also often linked to increased inflammation and higher rates of surgical complications. “We’re beginning to see how metabolic health, gut microbes and immune pathways interact—and how eating patterns may help restore that balance,” says Dr. Raman. The study recently published in Gastroenterology, shows promising results. Participants who tried intermittent fasting noticed a significant decrease in their body mass index, while those who did not fast maintained or increased their body mass. These changes occurred while both groups consumed the same number of daily calories and similar foods. The group which fasted also reported a reduction in their symptoms. “The people who fasted lost weight and visceral fat, showed signs not only in clinical disease improvement but also reduced inflammation. Importantly, these changes occurred without making any dietary changes. The only change they made was when they ate,” says Dr. Raman. The fasting focus group reported feeling better, and their metabolisms also showed significant improvements.",,"Why have I been blocked?

UBCO research show time-restricted eating shows promise for overweight people living with Crohn’s Fasting helps with Crohn's Photo: UBCO A new study has determined that intermittent fasting can help people with Crohn’s disease who are overweight. New research from the University of British Columbia, Okanagan and the University of Calgary shows intermittent fasting can help overweight people with Crohn’s disease. The research looked at how time-restricted eating could help people living with Crohn's, reduce symptoms and improve health benefits by changing when they ate as opposed to how much. Intermittent fasting has become a popular diet trend. But this new research collaboration between UBCO and the University of Calgary discovered it can also have health benefits for overweight people living with Crohn’s disease. UBCO clinical researcher, Dr. Natasha Haskey co-authored the study with Dr. Maitreyi Raman, an associate professor at the University of Calgary. The focus was on how overweight people with Crohn’s fared when they fasted for 16 hours a day but consumed their usual diet during the remaining eight hours of that same day. “We were curious whether this way of eating could improve symptoms, reduce visceral fat, which is fat around the organs, lower inflammation and support a healthier gut. And our preliminary research suggests it does,” says Dr. Haskey. Crohn’s disease can be complicated by excess visceral fat, which is also often linked to increased inflammation and higher rates of surgical complications. “We’re beginning to see how metabolic health, gut microbes and immune pathways interact—and how eating patterns may help restore that balance,” says Dr. Raman. The study recently published in Gastroenterology, shows promising results. Participants who tried intermittent fasting noticed a significant decrease in their body mass index, while those who did not fast maintained or increased their body mass. These changes occurred while both groups consumed the same number of daily calories and similar foods. The group which fasted also reported a reduction in their symptoms. “The people who fasted lost weight and visceral fat, showed signs not only in clinical disease improvement but also reduced inflammation. Importantly, these changes occurred without making any dietary changes. The only change they made was when they ate,” says Dr. Raman. The fasting focus group reported feeling better, and their metabolisms also showed significant improvements.","Third time lucky?

Group of UBCO students hopes to relaunch a Kelowna community fridge
Reviving community fridge
A group of students is trying to revive the Kelowna Community Fridge.
The fridge has been stocked with free items for those experiencing food insecurity.
It first opened at the headquarters of the Kelowna Unitarians on Bertram Street in spring 2021. It was then moved to outside Burke Hair Lounge on Lawrence Avenue in early 2023.
However, the fridge shut down a couple of years ago due to repeated vandalism and other problems.
Now, four students in the Bachelor of Sustainability program at UBC Okanagan (Thea Vermeulen, Madi Koch, Sydney Barnden, and Jolina Elsworth Larose) have come together with the goal of getting it up and running again.
“Madi, one of the group members, she was part of the fridge when it was up and running, I believe in 2021. Since then, she’s always wanted to get it started again, and we have the opportunity to do it now, so she brought up the idea to us,” said Thea Vermeulen.
“At this stage, we are focused on rebuilding the project thoughtfully and collaboratively, learning from past challenges while engaging local businesses, organizations, and residents in early conversations,” she added.
Vermeulen said she and the other organizers plan to host a public meeting in the next couple of weeks to share more about the project and get community input. The biggest hurdle will be finding a new location for the fridge.
“We’re currently still trying to figure out exactly where,” she said.
“We’re hoping to have the fridge up in September of this year, so we’re still definitely taking a couple of months to just make sure we have everything set up before we open up the fridge.”
Anyone interested in the project can email kelownacommunityfridge@gmail.com or follow Kelowna Community Fridge on Instagram.

Pet of the week
This week's Kelowna SPCA Pet of the Week is Surf.
This sweet girl came from a home with over 30 dogs and is very fearful of new situations.
She is very friendly and warms up quickly with treats and encouragement and is very food motivated.
Surf lived with other dogs and seems to be social with other dogs, which leads us to believe that she would love a resident canine companion.

First of three online events designed to strengthen women in all businesses
Women will get TogetHER
Two organizations that have always been there to support women in business are joining forces on a month-long project.
Okanagan College and WeBC are launching TogetHER, a leadership and growth initiative designed to bring self-identifying women business owners, leaders and entrepreneurs together to strengthen innovation and collaboration across the Okanagan.
“Okanagan College is committed to creating meaningful opportunities for women in every part of our economy, from skilled trades to innovation and enterprise,” Okanagan College trades and apprenticeship dean Caitlin Hartigan said in a press release. “TogetHER creates space for women-led businesses to connect, share expertise and build partnerships that can help support long-term success.”
TogetHER will host the first of three online innovation exchanges on Wednesday, Feb. 18. An industry leader and Okanagan College representative will lead the events, which are designed to bring female business leaders together to share experiences, explore solutions and build networks. The initiative will culminate with the two-day TogetHER Women’s Leadership Summit on March 5 and 6 at Okanagan College’s Vernon campus.
Female business owners, employers and community partners are invited to participate by enrolling in the innovation exchanges, attending the summit or engaging in mentorship activities. Visit okanagancollege.ca/together-innovation-exchange to learn more about TogetHER, which is supported by the Government of Canada’s Women Entrepreneurship Strategy.
“We know that access to strong networks, mentorship and practical support is critical for women entrepreneurs,” WeBC CEO Shauna Harper said. “Partnerships like TogetHER help create those connections at a regional level, supporting women-led businesses while strengthening local economies.”
Seasonal waterfront train, Dreamer Express, wraps up in Kelowna this weekend
Festive train rides near end
Kelowna residents and visitors have one last chance to ride the Dreamer Express, a seasonal trackless electric train that has been offering scenic waterfront tours since its launch in December.
The train, stationed at the Delta Grand Hotel, will conclude operations this weekend, running 35-minute rides along the city’s downtown waterfront.
The 40-foot, 30-passenger train was founded by local entrepreneurs Andrea Strang of Juniper Tree Learning and Maegan Young of Purple Rhino Events.
Each journey begins at “Delta Grand Central Station,” where a dedicated conductor welcomes passengers before they set off.
“We’re offering seasonal train rides, and we would love for people to come down and enjoy downtown Kelowna,” Young said. “For each season, we change the experience. For this one, we have incorporated the Tourism Kelowna Centre, where we have the love locks and the tourism signage of Kelowna and Love.''
Strang says one of the highlights has been seeing the joy it brings to the community.
“I’d say the best part is watching children run alongside and wave, seeing adults’ inner child come out, and the joy and genuine happiness that it brings to the downtown core of Kelowna.”
Young said the Dreamer Express has plans for seasonal expansions and special events.
“In the Easter time, we’ll be working with the Delta Grand and hopefully the City of Kelowna to have an Easter egg hunt and a full activation with games and fun for families,” she said.
“Then our plans are to move it to the Westside Wine Trail to do a hop-on, hop-off wine ride, whether you’re going to be drinking at the wineries or just want to experience the beauty of the Okanagan.”

Kelowna company completes first airplane conversion of its kind
Unique conversion at KF
Aviation history has been made in Kelowna.
KF Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineers Inc., or AEI, completed the world’s first combination conversion of a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The newly certified plane features a forward cargo compartment with five pallet positions and a 90-passenger cabin in the rear section.
The aircraft was completed and and delivered to Air Inuit in October.
KF Aerospace engineered and integrated fire detection, halon-based fire suppression and advanced smoke-containment systems for the forward cargo section, while also modifying existing freighter-specific detection systems to meet combi-specific criteria.
“This project reflects the ingenuity, dedication and deep technical expertise of our entire team,” KF Aerospace president Gregg Evjen said in a press release. “KF is proud to deliver a world-first solution that expands what’s possible in aircraft conversion and supports our customers’ complex operational needs.”
The airplane meets the customer’s requirement for a large-capacity mixed-use aircraft, which means it carries both cargo and passengers. KF Aerospace also said the project shows the company’s ability to overcome the regulatory and engineering challenges that have historically limited combi aircraft development worldwide.
“The achievement of the 737-800 combi underscores the power of a true partnership that KF and AEI have enjoyed over the course of three decades,” AEI senior vice-president Robert T. Convey said in a press release. “By combining AEI’s cargo door conversion expertise with KF’s engineering and operational strengths, we are able to deliver a world-first combi that unlocks new possibilities for operators worldwide.”
Kelowna immigration lawyer busy as Canada tightens border
Immigration lawyers busy
A Kelowna-based lawyer says his law firm's phone has been ringing off the hook with people seeking help with immigration issues as Canada tightens its borders.
Upwards of 1.4 million temporary work permits are set to expire in Canada in 2026. At the same time, the country will only accept 380,000 permanent residency applications.
Bryan Fitzpatrick, an immigration lawyer with Pushor Mitchell, says they have been “extremely busy” recently.
“Because the number of options are narrower, people now are less apt to do it themselves or wanting to do it themselves, so they are reaching out to get legal advice,"" he told Kelowna city councillor Mohini Singh on her podcast Chai and Chat, which appears regularly on Castanet.
Indian immigrants make up the largest portion of temporary workers in Canada, by far. Fitzpatrick said that is because they prioritize learning English in India, which gives them an advantage for entry.
“It was the focus of the federal government to grow our population, in turn help grow the economy,” he said.
But with unaffordable housing prices and a overburdened healthcare system, Fitzpatrick notes that moods have changes in both Ottawa and the public.
“We have an economy that is slowing and an unemployment rate that is high, so there is political pressure to go and follow through and enforce the immigration laws,” he said.
For those who still want to come to or stay in Canada, Fitzpatrick suggests studying or working in an in-demand field like healthcare.
“Find an area that you can contribute.”
But at the end of the day, he said, immigration policy is often fickle and governments often make changes to programs and intake stream.
“You always need to be aware, that things can change and policies change, immigration changes rapidly, changes with a new government.”
“Be proactive. Don’t wait until the last minute to try to understand what options are available to you.""
He said they should also be open minded about taking different types of jobs.

“I just want Gordie to be remembered as the young man who didn't like bullies. He was always polite, as I raised him to be. This is a huge shock for everyone around who knew Gordie,” Morris said.
Morris raised Perreault since he was two years old after taking him in from the system, giving him a childhood full of outdoor activities.
Police said the investigation remains on going, but did confirm the incident appears to have been targeted.
Morris said she received the devastating news in person after officers told her it was urgent they meet.
“It was a huge, huge shock for me,” she said.
She added that she has been given little information about what led to Perreault's death.
According to Morris, he attended Mount Boucherie Secondary School prior to his death.
''He needed a few more credits to get his diploma...he received the credits with encouragement from his teachers at the school. I thank them all for their support, kindness and encouragement for helping Gordie successfully achieve his grade 12 diploma.""
Anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police is asked to contact the Kelowna RCMP at 250-762-3300. Those wishing to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or submit a tip online.

A new study has determined that intermittent fasting can help people with Crohn’s disease who are overweight.


New research from the University of British Columbia, Okanagan and the University of Calgary shows intermittent fasting can help overweight people with Crohn’s disease.
The research looked at how time-restricted eating could help people living with Crohn's, reduce symptoms and improve health benefits by changing when they ate as opposed to how much.
Intermittent fasting has become a popular diet trend. But this new research collaboration between UBCO and the University of Calgary discovered it can also have health benefits for overweight people living with Crohn’s disease.
UBCO clinical researcher, Dr. Natasha Haskey co-authored the study with Dr. Maitreyi Raman, an associate professor at the University of Calgary.
The focus was on how overweight people with Crohn’s fared when they fasted for 16 hours a day but consumed their usual diet during the remaining eight hours of that same day.
“We were curious whether this way of eating could improve symptoms, reduce visceral fat, which is fat around the organs, lower inflammation and support a healthier gut. And our preliminary research suggests it does,” says Dr. Haskey.
Crohn’s disease can be complicated by excess visceral fat, which is also often linked to increased inflammation and higher rates of surgical complications.
“We’re beginning to see how metabolic health, gut microbes and immune pathways interact—and how eating patterns may help restore that balance,” says Dr. Raman.
The study recently published in Gastroenterology, shows promising results. Participants who tried intermittent fasting noticed a significant decrease in their body mass index, while those who did not fast maintained or increased their body mass.
These changes occurred while both groups consumed the same number of daily calories and similar foods.
The group which fasted also reported a reduction in their symptoms.
“The people who fasted lost weight and visceral fat, showed signs not only in clinical disease improvement but also reduced inflammation. Importantly, these changes occurred without making any dietary changes. The only change they made was when they ate,” says Dr. Raman.
The fasting focus group reported feeling better, and their metabolisms also showed significant improvements.



More Kelowna News","The Kelowna Community Fridge was closed after vandalism at the previous location along Lawrence Avenue. A group of students is trying to revive the Kelowna Community Fridge. The fridge has been stocked with free items for those experiencing food insecurity. It first opened at the headquarters of the Kelowna Unitarians on Bertram Street in spring 2021. It was then moved to outside Burke Hair Lounge on Lawrence Avenue in early 2023. However, the fridge shut down a couple of years ago due to repeated vandalism and other problems. Now, four students in the Bachelor of Sustainability program at UBC Okanagan (Thea Vermeulen, Madi Koch, Sydney Barnden, and Jolina Elsworth Larose) have come together with the goal of getting it up and running again. “Madi, one of the group members, she was part of the fridge when it was up and running, I believe in 2021. Since then, she’s always wanted to get it started again, and we have the opportunity to do it now, so she brought up the idea to us,” said Thea Vermeulen. “At this stage, we are focused on rebuilding the project thoughtfully and collaboratively, learning from past challenges while engaging local businesses, organizations, and residents in early conversations,” she added. Vermeulen said she and the other organizers plan to host a public meeting in the next couple of weeks to share more about the project and get community input. The biggest hurdle will be finding a new location for the fridge. “We’re currently still trying to figure out exactly where,” she said. “We’re hoping to have the fridge up in September of this year, so we’re still definitely taking a couple of months to just make sure we have everything set up before we open up the fridge.” Anyone interested in the project can email kelownacommunityfridge@gmail.com or follow Kelowna Community Fridge on Instagram.

A group of stranded hikers was brought to safety early Sunday morning after spending the night in Okanagan Mountain Park. Penticton and District Search and Rescue said the hikers trapped overnight in Okanagan Mountain Park were not adequately prepared for winter conditions. ""After convening at the hall and establishing contact with the subjects, a plan was developed in agreement with them for the group to remain in place overnight,"" PenSAR said. ""Responder safety is always our top priority. While we will do everything we can to assist those in need, decisions are made carefully to ensure the safety of both our members and the public."" Sunday at dawn, helicopters were dispatched to the stranded hikers, who were safely retrieved around 9 a.m. PenSAR thanked Central Okanagan Search and Rescue and Alpine Helicopters for coordinating efforts. The search and rescue team reminds people to prepare for winter hiking conditions with additional layers, water, food, lighting, and overnight essentials. ""Even short hikes can turn into overnight situations."" A group of hikers spent the night in the cold in Okanagan Mountain Park south of Kelowna. Central Okanagan Search and Rescue received a call around 6 p.m. on Saturday, asking for assistance for several hikers stranded in the Baker Lake area of Okanagan Mountain Park. The park spans coverage zones for both COSAR and Penticton Search and Rescue. COSAR said that after consulting with the regional rescue teams, the group of hikers was advised to shelter in place. The hikers were uninjured and equipped to spend the night on the mountain. They were successfully rescued early Sunday morning.

Seasonal waterfront train, Dreamer Express, wraps up in Kelowna this weekend Kelowna residents and visitors have one last chance to ride the Dreamer Express, a seasonal trackless electric train that has been offering scenic waterfront tours since its launch in December. The train, stationed at the Delta Grand Hotel, will conclude operations this weekend, running 35-minute rides along the city’s downtown waterfront. The 40-foot, 30-passenger train was founded by local entrepreneurs Andrea Strang of Juniper Tree Learning and Maegan Young of Purple Rhino Events. Each journey begins at “Delta Grand Central Station,” where a dedicated conductor welcomes passengers before they set off. “We’re offering seasonal train rides, and we would love for people to come down and enjoy downtown Kelowna,” Young said. “For each season, we change the experience. For this one, we have incorporated the Tourism Kelowna Centre, where we have the love locks and the tourism signage of Kelowna and Love.'' Strang says one of the highlights has been seeing the joy it brings to the community. “I’d say the best part is watching children run alongside and wave, seeing adults’ inner child come out, and the joy and genuine happiness that it brings to the downtown core of Kelowna.” Young said the Dreamer Express has plans for seasonal expansions and special events. “In the Easter time, we’ll be working with the Delta Grand and hopefully the City of Kelowna to have an Easter egg hunt and a full activation with games and fun for families,” she said. “Then our plans are to move it to the Westside Wine Trail to do a hop-on, hop-off wine ride, whether you’re going to be drinking at the wineries or just want to experience the beauty of the Okanagan.” More information on the Dreamer Express can be found here.

Kelowna company completes first airplane conversion of its kind The newly configured Boeing 737-800 has space for cargo up front and passengers in back. Aviation history has been made in Kelowna. KF Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineers Inc., or AEI, completed the world’s first combination conversion of a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The newly certified plane features a forward cargo compartment with five pallet positions and a 90-passenger cabin in the rear section. The aircraft was completed and and delivered to Air Inuit in October. KF Aerospace engineered and integrated fire detection, halon-based fire suppression and advanced smoke-containment systems for the forward cargo section, while also modifying existing freighter-specific detection systems to meet combi-specific criteria. “This project reflects the ingenuity, dedication and deep technical expertise of our entire team,” KF Aerospace president Gregg Evjen said in a press release. “KF is proud to deliver a world-first solution that expands what’s possible in aircraft conversion and supports our customers’ complex operational needs.” The airplane meets the customer’s requirement for a large-capacity mixed-use aircraft, which means it carries both cargo and passengers. KF Aerospace also said the project shows the company’s ability to overcome the regulatory and engineering challenges that have historically limited combi aircraft development worldwide. “The achievement of the 737-800 combi underscores the power of a true partnership that KF and AEI have enjoyed over the course of three decades,” AEI senior vice-president Robert T. Convey said in a press release. “By combining AEI’s cargo door conversion expertise with KF’s engineering and operational strengths, we are able to deliver a world-first combi that unlocks new possibilities for operators worldwide.”

A Kelowna-based lawyer says his law firm's phone has been ringing off the hook with people seeking help with immigration issues as Canada tightens its borders. Upwards of 1.4 million temporary work permits are set to expire in Canada in 2026. At the same time, the country will only accept 380,000 permanent residency applications. Bryan Fitzpatrick, an immigration lawyer with Pushor Mitchell, says they have been “extremely busy” recently. “Because the number of options are narrower, people now are less apt to do it themselves or wanting to do it themselves, so they are reaching out to get legal advice,"" he told Kelowna city councillor Mohini Singh on her podcast Chai and Chat, which appears regularly on Castanet. Indian immigrants make up the largest portion of temporary workers in Canada, by far. Fitzpatrick said that is because they prioritize learning English in India, which gives them an advantage for entry. “It was the focus of the federal government to grow our population, in turn help grow the economy,” he said. But with unaffordable housing prices and a overburdened healthcare system, Fitzpatrick notes that moods have changes in both Ottawa and the public. “We have an economy that is slowing and an unemployment rate that is high, so there is political pressure to go and follow through and enforce the immigration laws,” he said. For those who still want to come to or stay in Canada, Fitzpatrick suggests studying or working in an in-demand field like healthcare. “Find an area that you can contribute.” But at the end of the day, he said, immigration policy is often fickle and governments often make changes to programs and intake stream. “You always need to be aware, that things can change and policies change, immigration changes rapidly, changes with a new government.” “Be proactive. Don’t wait until the last minute to try to understand what options are available to you."" He said they should also be open minded about taking different types of jobs.
