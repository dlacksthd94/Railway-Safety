Driver error on a bus, or a drunk driver who caused it all? Millions of dollars are at stake as the Greyhound crash trial reaches the finishing line.

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- Driver error on a bus, or a drunk driver who caused it all? Millions of dollars are at stake as the Greyhound crash trial reaches the finishing line.

After five weeks in court, the trial over who's to blame for the 2010 crash is coming to a close and a jury will now decide. The families of Sylvia Garay, Stephanie Cordoba and Vanessa Gonzalez are suing the bus company, claiming the young women were killed, at least in part, because of a bus driver's mistakes.

An extensive California Highway Patrol investigation concluded Sylvia Garay was at fault because she was driving drunk and caused the first in what would be a chain reaction of crashes. But attorneys for her family say the evidence she was behind the wheel is just not there.

From any perspective, the crash on Highway 99 was an ugly one. Six people died early that July morning in 2010 when a Greyhound bus drove square into an overturned SUV in the fast lane. Three people died in the SUV; three in the bus.

From the perspective of the girls' families, the bus driver could've avoided the collision if he swerved a little, which he might've done if he wasn't violating a couple rules of the road.

""It's not okay at 2 o'clock in the morning to speed, if you're running late,"" said Jason Helsel, the attorney for Garay's family. ""It's not okay to not have your glasses on.""

But from Greyhound's perspective, those arguments are a smokescreen. CHP investigators found Sylvia Garay had a 0.11 blood alcohol content at the time of the crash and the 18-year-old crashed her mother's SUV. Everything afterwards was unavoidable.

At least three witnesses disagreed. They put Vanessa Gonzalez behind the wheel and Action News obtained video from earlier in the evening showing her in the driver's seat. Gonzalez had no alcohol in her system and was supposed to be acting as designated driver. So attorneys for the survivors say it's a stretch to believe Garay was driving in the fateful moments before the crash.

""You would have to believe that at those last moments she finally decided 'I'm going to throw the keys to Sylvia,'"" Helsel said. ""It just didn't happen.""

Greyhound's attorneys argue seat belt marks prove Gonzalez was a passenger. And they say it's unfair to second guess James Jewett, the bus driver who died in the crash.

Garay's family says the trial is all about clearing her name.

There's also the money. Garay family attorneys asked for $2 million in damages. The attorneys for the others asked for up to $4 million per family.

The jury should start deliberating the case Tuesday morning and a verdict is expected by the end of the week.",NO
20,tf_html,"A California man with a history of violence and mental illness has been found guilty of the random stabbing death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson on a commuter train platform two years ago, a killing with racial undertones that prompted rallies and vigils throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.An Alameda county jury announced on Tuesday it had found John Lee Cowell, 29, guilty of murdering Wilson at the MacArthur Bart station in Oakland as she was returning home from a family gathering with her two sisters. Jurors also found Cowell guilty of attempted murder in the stabbing of Wilson’s sister, who survived severe injuries to her neck.The jury also convicted Cowell of the special circumstances count of lying in wait. The jury reached the verdict hours after starting deliberations.Cowell will face a second trial to determine his sanity. If found insane, he would be sent to a psychiatric hospital.The stabbing death of the young African American woman in July 2018 horrified bystanders and added to Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart)’s reputation as unsafe. The commuter train system connects San Francisco to cities in the South and East Bay areas, including Oakland and Berkeley. Train officials sought to reassure the public with measures intended to improve safety.Family and friends have said the women were targeted because of their race but prosecutors declined to charge him with a hate crime. That doesn’t mean race did not come up. Cowell admitted at trial that he had been punched in the face by a black woman about a week before the train stabbing and the prosecutor queried him about trying to pick a fight with another black woman after the stabbing.Cowell followed the sisters from the platform on to a train for a 30-minute ride to another station, then stabbed them when they were boarding another train, the deputy district attorney Butch Ford told the jury in opening statements in early February.Videos showed Cowell tailing the women and removing a knife hidden in his pants in the attack that killed Wilson and wounded Letifah Wilson, 26. Video also showed Cowell trying to blend in with passengers after the assault, misdirecting officers and changing clothes he kept in a backpack that was tossed, along with the knife, at a nearby construction zone.“He took that little girl’s life,” Ford told jurors in closing arguments on Monday, the East Bay Times reported.Cowell has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His public defender, Christina Moore, argued that he stabbed the sisters in a “rash act” stemming from his mental illness and that a person can be organized yet schizophrenic.“This case is and always has been what was in John’s mind,” said Moore in her closing.Cowell was thrown out of court twice for disruptive behavior. He testified he thought the sisters were aliens and part of a gang that had kidnapped his grandmother.The trial, which took up much of February, had been delayed while authorities sought to determine Cowell’s mental competence through a series of psychiatric evaluations.In December, a judge ruled Cowell was fit to stand trial after noting that he was refusing to cooperate with doctors appointed to evaluate him.Cowell was released from a maximum-security facility for mentally ill convicts less than three months before the attack.",NO

Union, Ky. (WXIX) - Robert Evans is on a mission to bring his son back home after he’s been in the Intensive Care Unit at a hospital in San Bernardino since mid-December.
His son Dakota, who goes by “Kody,” was camping out in an embankment underneath a tree sleeping when he was struck by a drunk driver, according to Evans.
“Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen, I never thought he’d just be laying there and have a car on top of him,” said Evans.
Evans also said he was worried about him getting hit in a train accident, and never imagined he would have “a drunk driver drive on top of him” while he was minding his business.
“It was crazy, my initial reaction was, ‘Drop everything and fly out to California,’” Evans said.
Evans describes Dakota as being a free spirit who had set out on a journey.
“He’s walked, he’s hitchhiked, he’s hopped trains - whatever he can do to get around the country - when I say ‘free spirit,’ I mean ‘free spirit,’ Evans said. “No fear, just traveling by whatever means possible to get to where he needed to go.”
Evans recalls that after the accident, Dakota woke up three weeks later in the ICU with tubes coming out of his chest, and he was unable to move. He says his son suffered from a broken spine, a severed spinal cord, collapsed lungs and broken ribs, and his injuries left him paralyzed from the waist down.
“We all just hoped and prayed that he’d even live,” said Evans.
Dakota is now breathing on his own and Evans says he no longer needs a ventilator and has made vast improvements. The medical staff caring for him now call him “The Miracle ICU Man.”
Evans said Dakota’s neurosurgeon told him after the spinal surgery that he’d never seen anyone survive the trauma and damage that he experienced.
“To see him make these improvements, it helps tremendously,” Evans said.
Evans also says he’s been working to get the doctors onboard to get his son stable enough to come back to Cincinnati and says he plans on renting a van for the cross-country trek to California to bring him to Encompass Health Rehabilitation Center in Norwood as soon as possible.
A Go Fund Me account was created to cover his medical expenses and rehab. So far, more than $20,000 has already been raised toward the $50,000 goal.

The parents of Monique Muñoz, who was killed in 2021 by a speeding teen driver in West Los Angeles, will receive more than $18 million in a wrongful death settlement — and could receive more than $25 million in total.

“The money will never bring back their daughter,” said Daniel Ghyczy, the lead attorney representing the victim’s parents. “Their focus has been trying to prevent something like this from ever happening to someone else — and to make sure that someone else doesn't get that call that their child had been killed because of a senseless act of negligence.”

In the lawsuit, Ghyczy and his team highlighted a pattern of high-speed, dangerous driving by the teen’s father, millionaire entrepreneur James Khuri. Along with displaying that behavior for his son Brendan to see, Khuri also gifted his son the Lamborghini SUV that he later crashed into Muñoz’s car, killing her.

Screenshots of social media posts (many of which have been deleted) show the elder Khuri driving his own sports car in excess of 100 mph, and video, allegedly shot by his son, shows Khuri engaged in high-speed, illegal street races. Khuri’s public Instagram features multiple posts of him with his sports cars.

And despite knowing his son was driving the SUV recklessly, Khuri allowed his son to continue driving, which Ghyczy’s team said demonstrated “despicable conduct in conscious disregard of the rights of others,” including Muñoz.

The crash happened on Feb. 17, 2021 when Muñoz, 32, was driving home from work at UCLA Health and attempted to make an unprotected left-turn south onto Overland Avenue from westbound Olympic Boulevard.

Brendan Khuri was driving over 100 mph eastbound on Olympic, prosecutors later said at his trial. He entered the intersection as Muñoz was completing her turn, smashing into her car. Police officials believe Muñoz died almost instantly.

One LAPD detective initially described the scene to LAist as almost ""complete devastation"" and ""among the worst aftermath of a traffic collision that I've seen.""

Brendan Khuri was later charged with felony vehicular manslaughter. He later pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 7-9 months in a juvenile camp.

Investigators previously told LAist the teen was charged in part because he’d been cited previously for reckless driving.

'They Do Nothing To Stop This From Happening'

In the lawsuit, Ghyczy and his team said James Khuri, along with Brendan Khuri’s mother, Christine Khuri, and stepfather, Richard Roderick, were fully aware of the teen’s pattern of dangerous driving, but “created an environment that further encouraged this behavior.”

“Not only did they do nothing to stop this from happening, they took steps which led to this happening,” Ghyczy told LAist.

He said the SUV that the teen crashed into Monique Muñoz’s car had been impounded by Beverly Hills police a few months earlier due to the teen’s reckless driving. Tow records obtained by Ghyczy’s law firm show James Khuri got the car back within 48 hours.

“It's not just ‘kids will be kids,’” Ghyczy said. “It's obvious that James Khuri knew what [his son] was doing.”

So far, no restitution has been paid by the Khuri family.

“They had refused all requests to contribute personally towards the settlement,” Ghyczy told LAist. “My clients were not looking for money, so they felt it was most important to be able to put this behind them to obtain 100% of what was available from the insurance companies in the civil matter.”

The $18.85 million payout will come from the insurance companies the teen driver was covered under at the time of the fatal crash. The plaintiffs’ attorneys state that Brendan Khuri “was engaged in a business errand for the direct or indirect benefit” of , LLC, which specialized in risk consulting and commercial insurance brokerage.

“The insurance companies were saying that Monique Muñoz’s life was not worth 100% of what was available for insurance coverage,” said Ghyczy. “It wasn't about establishing worth, it's about sending a message that just because Monique Muñoz was Hispanic… and just because Brendan Khuri was affluent from Beverly Hills, there was no discount that was going to be accepted.”

There is still a criminal restitution component to be decided in the case. Ghyczy explained Brendan Khuri may be required to personally pay restitution following a hearing expected this June or July.

He said Muñoz's parents feels their claims against James Khuri are further validated by the fact that he is currently facing a misdemeanor charge for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

An arrest warrant was initially issued for Khuri on Feb. 16 this year, but was recalled the following day when he appeared in court, according to Ricardo Santiago from the L.A. County District Attorney’s Office. James Khuri’s arraignment has been set for June 8.",NO

San Bernardino County authorities announced this week that a 34-year-old man had been arrested and accused of igniting the Line Fire, which has burned more than 37,000 acres in San Bernardino County.So how often is arson to blame for wildfires in California?



What do the numbers show?Gianni Muschetto, staff chief of law enforcement at Cal Fire, said about 10-15% of wildfires in the last five years were the result of arson.
Pointing to published data from 2022 as an example, he said there were 358 arson fires in the state that year, amounting to about 12,000 burned acres. Each time, firefighters and members of the public were put at risk.“It’s not an accident, it’s not lightning. It’s a reckless or malicious act,” Muschetto told LAist.He mentioned the Park Fire, which fire authorities have said was set in July by a man accused of pushing a burning car down a gully near Chico. It’s reportedly the fourth-largest wildfire in recorded state history.The blaze burned nearly 430,000 acres in Butte and Tehama counties.“None of us, in our lifetime, are going to see those forests come back to what they were,” Muschetto said.



What are the common causes of wildfires?Wildfires can be started by natural causes, like a lightning strike, but far more often people are to blame. According to the National Park Service, nearly 85% of wildland fires in the U.S. are caused by human action.
Fire officials often point to neglecting campfires, operating machinery (like a faulty lawnmower) or discarding lit cigarettes as ways people may unintentionally ignite dry brush.But there are times when it’s no accident. It’s arson.In 2022 and 2021, Cal Fire identified arson as a cause in more than 350 fires each year, according to the department's most recent published data. Arson was the cause more often than campfires, playing with fire, electrical power, lightning and smoking. But it was less than a few other causes, like burning debris. In one of those years, 2021, there were more fires caused by vehicles — 419 — than arson.Cal Fire authorities had more recent data for arson-related arrests. Those arrests nearly doubled last year when compared to five years earlier. Last year, there were 111 arrests on suspicion of arson in Cal Fire areas. In 2018, there were 61.Within that five-year stretch, the most arson-related arrests happened in 2022, when there were 162, according to Cal Fire.
Muschetto attributed the higher numbers, in part, to video evidence captured on cellphones and home security cameras.“It allows us to identify those responsible for starting fires a lot more than we’ve been able to in the past,” he said.



How can suspected arson be reported?Members of the public can call Cal Fire’s hotline if they suspect arson. The phone number is 800-468-4408.Callers can remain anonymous.



What are some notable arson arrests?Line fire — Justin Wayne Halstenberg, a 34-year-old contract delivery driver from Norco, was arrested Tuesday, on suspicion of  starting the fire, which burned thousands of acres in L.A. and San Bernardino counties.
San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus said Halstenberg is suspected of intentionally setting the fire, and that investigators were looking into the possibility that he may be responsible for setting others. The sheriff said automatic license plate readers captured a license plate of a vehicle connected to Halstenberg near where the Line Fire began.Dicus declined to say exactly how the fire was set, noting the investigation is in its early stages.Halstenberg is expected to appear in court Friday.Park Fire — Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, was arrested on suspicion of arson in connection with the massive blaze that started near Chico. Cal Fire said a man they identified as Stout was seen pushing a car that was already on fire into a gully in an area called Alligator Hole. The car went 60 feet down an embankment, spreading flames that eventually burned more than 400,000 acres and destroyed more than 700 structures.Stout has pleaded not guilty and has denied pushing the car — he said it rolled — down the hill, according to The Sacramento Bee.El Dorado fire — A San Bernardino couple who set off pyrotechnics during a gender-reveal party in 2020 and inadvertently ignited the blaze that turned into the 22,000-acre El Dorado fire were sentenced in February. The fire killed a U.S. Forest Service firefighter and injured others. Five homes were destroyed.Refugio Manuel Jimenez Jr. pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to a year in county jail and placed on probation for a term of two years. He was also ordered to do community service, according to the L.A. Times.Angelina Jimenez pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor counts of recklessly causing a fire to another’s property and was placed on probation for a year.  She, too, was ordered to complete community service.

1156,rd_url,"In November 1924, film producer Thomas H. Ince suddenly died after boarding William Randolph Hearst’s yacht. Was it ill health, bad luck or perhaps plain murder?
William Randolph Hearst, the legendary newspaper magnate, may have controlled much of the news media in 1920s America. But there was one story he didn’t want to hit the headlines in November 1924.
Hollywood film producer and “Father of the Western” Thomas H. Ince had climbed aboard the tycoon’s yacht, the Oneida, in a festive mood. Ince was on deck to celebrate his 44th birthday and salute a lucrative business deal in the works with Hearst. But after only a day aboard, he began complaining of stomach pains and soon started vomiting blood. The producer was hurriedly escorted off the boat as his health began deteriorating and taken to local doctors ashore.
After a few days back on land, Ince was dead. Heart troubles felled the man—or so the official story went.
In the immediate years after the moviemaker’s untimely demise a century ago, rumor and conjecture stalked this tragic incident. Did Ince really die from sudden heart problems? (“Angina pectoris” as per the official autopsy.) Did a combination of stomach ulcers, stress and even bootleg booze prove a lethal one? Or was there a sinister conspiracy afoot and Ince was simply collateral damage?
Owing to the players on board the yacht—a hot-shot Hollywood producer, a media mogul (plus his mistress), a big movie star (Charlie Chaplin no less), and an influential movie screenwriter—the event has become the fabled stuff of Hollywood legend.
Popular (but dubious) written histories, like Kenneth Anger’s Hollywood Babylon, have long doubted the official cause of death and speculated on all kinds of theories. One is that Hearst killed Ince by accident—and hushed up all parties after the fact. Another is that Hearst murdered the filmmaker on purpose for flirting with his lover, Marion Davies. So tantalizing is this tale in movie-making lore that even Hearst’s own granddaughter, Patricia “Patty” Hearst, got in on action and co-authored a fictionalized conspiracy novel on it called Murder at San Simeon.
How do we separate fact from fiction? While largely accurate accounts of the death were retold in major (non-Hearst) newspapers at the time, like the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times, conspiracy and scepticism about truthful reporting clouded many people’s judgment. Recent books have done important fact-finding and correction—like the fastidious Thomas Ince: Hollywood’s Independent Pioneer by writer Brian Taves—to thoroughly refute lingering claims made by the likes of Anger’s Hollywood Babylon and other suspect retellings.
So, how did this salacious scandal all start? It begins with Ince, who was a successful movie producer and director in the 1920s Silent Era, best known for popularizing Civil War pictures and formalizing production methods on early film sets. His enterprising spirit and trade acumen made him a formidable figure in the picture business, which translated to profitable ventures like his own production company and even an entire studio town, Inceville, where his westerns were made.
At the time Ince was making cowboy films at Inceville, aristocrat and media magnate Hearst started seeing cinema as an unconquered frontier for his media empire. Moving pictures would be an opportunity to turn the likes of newspaper cartoons into animations and translate more news into popular news reels. By 1919, Hearst was laying the groundwork for his own movie studio and became interested in seeing who the main players were in La La Land for possible partnerships. The paths of the two finally crossed—and Hearst had an offer too good to refuse.
Davies, an aspirational movie star and the mistress to Hearst, was pitched as a screen idol on the rise. The 27-year-old just needed a major movie to help her get there. Enter Ince. In 1924, Hearst proposed an arrangement whereby Ince would produce a film starring Davies. If all went well with the picture, a more formal arrangement would be brokered between the two men, namely for Hearst’s Cosmopolitan Productions to lease Ince’s sprawling movie lot.
The infamous November sojourn aboard Oneida was then to be a celebration of this new promising business venture and an added birthday treat for Ince (whose birthday was November 16). A veritable list of guests joined the festivities including Davies, Chaplin and movie screenwriter Elinor Glyn (who popularized the “it girl” in movie scripts). The luxurious, if ill-fated, yacht left San Pedro, California on November 15, 1924.
Aboard the vessel, indulgent food and heavy liquor was served, including copies amount of champagne (and likely some bootleg booze). Ince had reportedly been told to avoid such rich beverages and foodstuffs as the overworked producer was suffering from painful stomach ulcers. After the revelries, Ince complained of fatigue and became increasingly ill that night. Moans and groans were reportedly heard from his bedroom.
Whether it was the fine champagne or even the illicit moonshine, the combination proved totally enervating. Ince asked to be escorted from the boat the next day. After arriving on land and taking a train ride to Los Angeles (via Del Mar), Ince suddenly died—just days after boarding Hearst’s yacht. For Ince biographer Taves, the death is a tragic event and an unsuspicious end for the producer:
Digestive problems aggravated during the trip, combined with the ulcers, had proved too great a strain for his heart.
But others at the time were quick to doubt this official story—even the one given by the San Diego District Attorney (D.A.), Chester C. Kempley. The D.A. had reassured the public:
“I am satisfied that the death of Thomas H. Ince was caused by heart failure as the result of an attack of acute indigestion. There will be no investigation into the death of Ince, at least so far as San Diego County is concerned.”
But gossip and intrigue went into overdrive in late 1924 owing to Ince’s unexpected death at 44 and the likes of Hearst, his mistress, and Chaplin all orbiting Ince in the days before. A few key elements galvanized the public’s immediate unwillingness to believe the official spin of the story. This included Hearst’s notable absence from Ince’s funeral; the quick cremation of Ince’s body; and claims the death certificate was stitched up by the coroner. The fact that Hearst’s Los Angeles Herald Express carried few stories about Ince after the funeral was also questionable to some.
In place of news of Ince’s unfortunate death came claims that Chaplin was the true target of Hearst’s deadly wrath. After finding the movie star in a compromising position with Davies below deck, Hearst had apparently gone to shoot Chaplin with his gun and fatally killed Ince instead.
But Ince biographer Taves is quick to correct this and other dubious claims. Not only did Chaplin stand a foot shorter than Ince but Hearst was an “expert shot.” If he did indeed want Chaplin dead, he would have had a far more deadly aim. Moreover, given Ince had an open casket, it’s unlikely a bullet in Ince’s skull could have been concealed at such a public viewing. The Los Angeles Times report for the November 22 funeral confirmed attendees could “view for the last time the features of their chief.”
In fairness to the public, there was confusion across news stories during the frenzy to report on this salacious episode. The Hearst publication, Moving Picture, said that the tycoon was at San Simeon and not onboard the yacht; the New York Times, meanwhile, acknowledged Ince’s death from heart complications but said he was “stricken on [a] train” and noticeably didn’t mention Hearst at all.
What also added to the intrigue was the name of Louella Parsons, the famed gossip columnist who some claimed was aboard the Oneida. Rumor had it that Parsons had indeed seen Hearst slay Ince by mistake—whether by gun-shot or by poison, as others claim Hearst had done—but was keeping quiet on the crime because the tycoon had given her a lifetime contract and expanded her print syndication. But as truth would have it, Parsons wasn’t even on the yacht and had become motion picture editor of the New York American a year earlier, in December 1923.
Rival publications did their due diligence too and conducted independent investigations. Each ultimately reported nothing suspect. The Los Angeles Times interviewed medical personnel, coroners and even the water-taxi staff and discovered no new leads. Ince had fallen ill, been treated ashore by physicians and soon died of (natural and unfortunate) heart complications. The Boston Globe, on December 10, 1924, detailed these and the D.A.’s findings and concurred an absence of any foul play.
The intrigue of a murder still fascinated Hollywood in the years since, despite many reported facts and official announcements contradicting this narrative. Other minor aspects that suggested conspiracy—like Ince’s wife Elinor “quickly” departing for Europe or Hearst’s absence at the funeral—could also be easily fact-checked. Elinor didn’t flee for Europe early (as if hushed up by Hearst) but departed some eight months later in July 1925. As for funerals, Hearst had a famous fear of death and an aversion to these somber affairs, so would have never attended. Chaplin too remained friendly with the media magnate in later years, casting doubt on claims the movie star wronged Hearst by pursuing Davies on the yacht.
If anything played a key role in Ince’s death and went unreported, it was the presence of bootleg liquor. As America was deep in Prohibition in 1924, there was likely a bootlegging operation supplying the alcohol aboard Hearst’s vessel. Some rightly speculate that a bit of noxious liquid may have only compounded the stressed-out, heart-troubled movie-producer’s health troubles and exasperated his ticker.
“The occasion allowed his many enemies and rivals to exploit,” writes Taves on the entire episode, “a fissure in the armor of the warning Hearst empire.” It has long proven the fodder of scandal writers like Anger, who waxed lyrical on the conspiracy that surrounded the episode and refused to engage in basic fact-finding. Scandal, sex and murder always get more eyeballs. Others, like playwright Steven Peros, fictionalized the story for his play The Cat’s Meow, which was later adapted into a playful 2001 film by Peter Bogdanovich whereby Chaplin was caught in bed with Davies—and Ince proved collateral damage.
A century on, Ince may be best known in Hollywood’s history for the scandal surrounding his premature death. But the producer and director was a pioneering figure during the early days of movie-making, in particular in organizing productions methods into a methodical system and braving tough topics in movies he produced, like the dangers of drug addiction (Human Wreckage) and religious hypocrisy (Civilization). For 1920s America, that was no small feat.

820,rd_html,"Production sets will observe a moment of silence this week to commemorate the second anniversary of the death of Sarah Jones, the camera assistant who was killed in the Feb. 20, 2014, train accident on the location of “Midnight Rider.”

The Sarah Jones Film Foundation, set up by Jones’ family, is calling for the moment of silence as part of its Safety for Sarah campaign, one of a series of initiatives to boost on-set safety.

“One of the phrases we try to remember is ‘never forget, never again,'” said Richard Jones, her father. “Never forget what happened to Sarah Jones when safety is shoved aside. And let’s do what we can to never let it happen again.”

Jones’ parents, who live in South Carolina, have become advocates for safety on film sets, and have been in Los Angeles this month to raise awareness for the foundation’s campaign. Her mother, Elizabeth Jones, said that “the very first phrase that took place is ‘Don’t let our daughter’s death be in vain.’ “

The production failed to obtain permission from CSX Transportation, the owner of the railroad tracks on the set, but shot on a trestle anyway. When a train came, the production team was forced to flee with less than a minute to get off the railroad bridge.

The director of “Midnight Rider,” Randall Miller, is currently serving a two-year sentence in Wayne County Jail in Jesup, Ga., after pleading guilty last year to charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass.

Richard Jones said that the moment of silence also will be in recognition of the eight injured on the set that day. The accident triggered an outcry about on-set safety, with crew members wearing buttons that said “We Are Sarah Jones.” The concerns have been less about a need for new regulations and guidelines, and more about existing standards not being followed.

“We understand that even when a story is a little bit bigger, it is going to fade away,” Jones said. “To maintain that awareness of the need for safety is really what it comes down to. It is not really about Sarah, because she is gone. There is nothing we can do for her. It is about the living. How can we in five years keep safety in the minds of people, and the horrible, horrible kinds of things that can happen in just ignoring people’s health and safety.”

The foundation has started a program in which productions display the “Safety for Sarah” logo in end credits after signing an agreement to observe safety guidelines, conduct daily safety meetings and acknowledge the first shot of the day as the “Jonsey,” to remember what happened to Sarah Jones when proper safety procedures were not taken.

The agreement also allows for “anyone, at anytime, to call a ‘Sarah Timeout’ without concern for their job or reputation, should they not feel safe or need further clarification regarding a safety issue. A ‘Sarah Timeout’ will allow for a one-minute on-set pause. Should it be justified, this brief timeout may be extended until the issue is clarified or resolved.” The timeout is intended to address concerns that crew members would be too reluctant to raise for fear of being viewed as a troublemaker.

“We are wanting to empower anyone on a set who feels they may be in danger to at least speak out,” Jones said. “In the case of ‘Midnight Rider,’ in talking to various people there, we don’t know, but we feel that if they had the ability just to take a breath, that they might have realized the madness of what they were doing that day. The madness just doesn’t make sense.”

The foundation also is endorsing a feature documentary, “We Are Sarah Jones,” directed by Eric S. Smith, which will examine not just the tragedy and Jones’ life but the safety campaign that has been launched in the wake of the accident.

The foundation also is inviting productions to post photos of the moment of silence on the Safety for Sarah Facebook page, the @SlatesforSarah Twitter feed and Instagram with #SafetyforSarah. They also are working with film schools to incorporate Sarah Jones’ story into safety instruction.

Meanwhile, others injured still have litigation pending against the filmmakers, and the Jones family has a pending claim against CSX. They reached a settlement with the production in November, 2014.

Film Allman, the production company set up by Miller and his wife, producer Jody Savin, is challenging almost $75,000 in safety fines in an appellate court, and also has litigation pending against the production insurer.

Last month, the judge in the “Midnight Rider” case, Anthony Harrison, rejected Miller’s effort to modify his sentence and gain release. The director’s legal team cited Miller’s poor health and good behavior.

The issue could arise again. Miller’s attorney, Ed Garland, said in a recent court filing that “a special condition” of his probation was that he serve two years in Wayne County Jail “with time to be computed by the Sheriff who committed to a two-for-one computation of service.” That credit for good behavior would mean that Miller is eligible for release next month. But Richard Jones said that they were not aware of such a one-year deal, and that the the sheriff of Wayne County, John Carter, also was not aware of it. Although the sheriff has the discretion to determine such a release, Jones said that Carter told him that he “had not had a felony case he had used this power with” and would have to seek legal counsel.

Meanwhile, Jones said that they have seen an impact that the case has had on set safety — with the challenge now being that it is not forgotten.

The driver accused of killing four Pepperdine students in a Malibu crash last week was charged with murder, with prosecutors saying he was speeding at 104 mph before the fatal collision.

Fraser Michael Bohm, 22, faces four counts of malice murder and four counts of gross vehicular manslaughter, Dist. Atty. George Gascón said during a Wednesday news conference, adding that the charges stem from Bohm’s “complete disregard for the life of others.”

“When you are driving at 104 mph in [a] 45-mph [zone], the only conclusion is you have a complete disregard for life,” Gascón said.

Bohm pleaded not guilty to the eight felony charges Wednesday in a Van Nuys courtroom. He remains in jail on $4-million bail, with a bail review hearing scheduled for Thursday.

The four people killed — Niamh Rolston, Peyton Stewart, Asha Weir and Deslyn Williams — were sisters in the Alpha Phi sorority and seniors at Pepperdine University. Authorities believe they were standing near several parked vehicles in the 21600 block of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu when Bohm’s speeding BMW barreled into the cars and then struck the women shortly before 9 p.m. Oct. 17.

Bohm was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence following the crash, Los Angeles County sheriff’s Sgt. Maria Navarro said. But he was released hours later. In a news release at the time, the Sheriff’s Department said he was “released to allow detectives time to gather the evidence needed to secure the strongest criminal filing and conviction.”

Bohm was re-arrested Tuesday night and booked on suspicion of four counts of murder. In the intervening days between arrests, investigators collected additional evidence — including toxicology results, search warrants and speed analyses — before submitting the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office on Monday.

A student-athlete during high school, Bohm played baseball at Chaminade Prep before transferring to Oaks Christian. A spokesperson for Oaks Christian, a private high school in the Conejo Valley, told the Acorn that Bohm had attended the school for one year but did not graduate. An online MaxPreps profile showed he played on the school’s varsity baseball team. A 2017 Times story said the infielder-pitcher at Chaminade Prep was “highly regarded.”

Investigators have determined that Bohm was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash, but the onboard computer of his car shows he was traveling at 104 mph before he lost control in the deadly collision, according to law enforcement sources not authorized to discuss the case publicly. It was that data, along with statements by Bohm that he was familiar with the stretch of PCH and that he was aware of the posted 45-mph speed limit, that led to the charges against him, sources say.

But Bohm’s attorney, Michael Kraut, says his client was not traveling that fast. He also has forwarded a claim to prosecutors alleging that another vehicle was involved in the crash. He said Wednesday that his client is the victim of a road-rage incident that night.

“They ignored evidence of a second car,” Kraut told The Times. “My client was getting away from the guy chasing him.”

Kraut said another driver “came into the lane and clipped him” and Bohm “hit the brakes.”

“The evidence turned over showed at max [he was going] 70 mph,” Kraut said of the information he has received in the case, adding that his client has “totally cooperated” with the investigation and passed a field sobriety test.

Kraut, who is a former prosecutor, said he has “never seen the filing of a vehicular homicide in four or five days without getting all the details.” He said the district attorney was under political pressure to file charges in the case and had not ensured that all the information was gathered ahead of time.

Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Sgt. Jim Arens told reporters Wednesday at the news conference that he had “no evidence” that the crash stemmed from an alleged road rage incident.

The collision has renewed calls for safety improvements on PCH, particularly in the area of the crash, which some call “Dead Man’s Curve.”

The Malibu City Council on Monday heard from dozens of residents calling for action to improve safety and force drivers to slow down on the stretch of road. The council unanimously voted to ask city staff for a report and to consider a motion to declare an emergency, which would free up resources within its jurisdiction to make PCH safer.

Jennifer Seetoo, captain of the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department’s Malibu/Lost Hills station, recalled speaking with three of the victims’ families in the immediate aftermath of the crash.

“It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do as a police officer,” Seetoo told the council, adding that it was a task she hoped never to have to repeat. She said there needed to be “substantive change” to make the 21 miles of PCH in Malibu safer.

Mayor Steve Uhring said he would like to see more state support on the issue, especially a return of the California Highway Patrol, which doesn’t monitor the incorporated stretch of PCH in Malibu. He also is hopeful Malibu will be able to take advantage of the state’s new pilot program for speed cameras.

“We’ve got this major highway running through the center of our city — it’s a racetrack; it has been for years,” Uhring said. “We need some help.”

Gascón outlined the uptick in traffic deaths, noting that speeds in many incidents have “far exceeded those in the past.”

The district attorney, who notoriously campaigned on a pledge to not seek the death penalty in capital cases, said if Bohm were convicted on all counts, “sentencing could be extensive.”

650,np_url,"Federal safety investigators have released a synopsis of their coming final report on the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and seven others on the flight. They found definitively that the safety regulations proposed in the Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant Helicopter Safety Act would not have prevented the deadly crash.

That bill, introduced by Rep. Brad Sherman (D–Calif.) less than a week after the basketball star's death in January 2020, would mandate that all helicopters come equipped with Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS), a technology that warns pilots if they are flying too close to the ground or other obstacles they might not be able to see.

Yet at a Tuesday meeting of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is responsible for investigating transportation accidents and making safety recommendations, investigators said that TAWS would not have prevented the crash that killed Bryant and his fellow passengers.

""It's great technology, we just don't think it applies here,"" said NTSB investigator Bill English in response to a question about TAWS. English said that the safety technology was most useful in situations where a pilot is in control of his or her vehicle but is unaware of the surrounding terrain.

The crash that killed Bryant in contrast, he said, was a product of the pilot becoming ""spatially disorientated"" while attempting to fly above cloud cover to avoid hilly terrain he was already aware of. Those cloudy conditions caused the pilot to become confused as to his direction, telling an air traffic controller he was still ascending when in fact he was plummeting to the ground.

""At that point the aircraft is not in control. The pilot doesn't really know which way was up so this type of system [TAWS] would not aid in that situation,"" said English. ""It would likely just be a confusing factor more than anything else.""

The irrelevance of TAWS to the crash stands in contrast to the attention the technology received, from both policymakers and the media, immediately following Bryant's death.

The Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, among other outlets, ran articles questioning whether the technology could have prevented the accident.

Jennifer Homendy, a board member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said in a press conference two days after the crash that ""certainly, TAWS could have helped to provide information to the pilot on what terrain the pilot was flying in.""

(The NTSB has recommended all helicopters be equipped with TAWS since 2006. The Federal Aviation Administration has declined to implement that recommendation except for helicopter ambulances.)

Sherman went further by saying that if Bryant's helicopter had the technology, ""it is likely the tragic crash could have been avoided.""

Despite the media attention and advocacy from Vanessa Bryant, Kobe's widow, Sherman's bill stalled in the face of opposition from the helicopter industry.

Sherman lamented this in comments to the Los Angeles Times a couple of weeks ago, saying that ""even the death of Kobe Bryant hasn't gotten us where we need to go."" The Times reported Tuesday that he was updating his safety legislation to include NTSB recommendations that pilots undergo more simulation training on how to respond to changing weather conditions.

The fact that Sherman's signature mandate would not have saved the people after whom he named his bill should prompt more reflection. Policymaking in response to a tragedy, when many of the facts have yet to come in, is a recipe for imposing ineffective solutions. Worse still, it circumvents the cost-benefit analyses that regulators and legislators should employ when considering costly mandates.

The Times reports that installing TAWS costs upwards of $35,000 per helicopter. If the government is going to require companies to install such a costly system on their vehicles, it should at a minimum be sure it would produce tangible safety benefits that outweigh the compliance costs for private operators and small firms.

Moreover, it's important to consider whether money spent on one expensive technology couldn't be more effectively directed toward other safety solutions.

In an effort to prevent fatal, headline-grabbing train derailments, for instance, the federal government has required rail companies to spend billions adopting positive train control technology to prevent such accidents. But each dollar spent preventing deaths from derailments is a dollar that isn't spent on preventing much more common deaths from collisions at road-rail intersections or from trespassers on tracks.

The NTSB recommends that Island Express Helicopters, the company that was operating the helicopter flight that killed Bryant, participate in the FAA's Safety Management System Voluntary Program, and install flight data monitoring programs on its helicopters and then review that data to identify potential safety issues.

Mandating that the company adopt TAWS, which wouldn't have prevented the accident in question, would leave it with less time and resources to put toward developing safety measures that might have actually made a difference.

Passenger terminals, like Tom Bradley International, are being remodeled with upscale shopping and dining. Runways are being refurbished, and public transit is finally on the way.

But high up in the control tower of the nation’s second-busiest airport, the outlook is not so good. Air traffic controllers are working longer and harder than ever to safely handle the enormous volume of aircraft that arrives and departs at this prominent West Coast gateway.

Overtime is soaring and serious staff shortages loom despite warnings issued in 2009 by the inspector general for the U.S. Transportation Department.

The dropout rate for trainees has been as high as 60%, and many controllers routinely work more than five days a week, raising concerns about fatigue. The situation has become so bad even seasoned professionals seek reassignment to less stressful airports.

“It’s gotten worse,” said Mike Foote, an LAX air traffic controller and local representative of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. “We are not saying the sky is falling or an accident is imminent. But fatigue is a real thing. We are tired, and we have been grinding this out for years. It is in the best interest of everyone, especially the flying public, that the staffing and overtime issues get resolved.”

Federal Aviation Administration officials said they share the controllers’ concerns and that steps are being taken at LAX and facilities across the country to attract and train additional personnel. Several rounds of hiring have occurred during the last two years, they added, and more recruitment drives are planned.

The controllers association said some of the most acute staff shortages are at five air traffic control centers that guide aircraft into several dozen major airports. They include Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson, Chicago O’Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston Intercontinental as well as La Guardia and John F. Kennedy in New York.

But LAX is “in worse shape than a lot of the facilities we have concerns about because of the complexity of the traffic,” said Patricia Gilbert, executive vice president of the controllers association. “You just can’t take an academy graduate and expect him or her to qualify in a complicated tower like LAX’s.”

The FAA and union leaders attribute most of the problem at LAX to three major things: deep congressional budget cuts, an unexpectedly heavy rate of retirements and the complexities of maneuvering hundreds of commercial planes a day — from regional carriers to international jumbo jets — around a relatively small, 3,500-acre airfield surrounded by urban development.

Though staffing numbers can be fluid, LAX now has 39 fully certified controllers and 11 trainees who were credentialed at other airports but need to learn local procedures. Foote says 19 controllers are eligible to retire or are awaiting retirement dates. Three others could become supervisors.

According to the association and the inspector general’s 2009 audit, the number of fully certified air traffic controllers at LAX has dropped from 45 in 2004. Meanwhile, overtime has continued to climb, from 5,866 hours in fiscal year 2008 to 13,396 hours in fiscal 2015. There were 606 hours of overtime in 2006.

The vast majority of extra hours, Foote said, are absorbed by fully certified controllers, many of whom have been putting in at least 40 six-day workweeks a year.

The annual salary of a typical controller is about $122,500, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, with overtime paid at time and a half.

Reports by the federal Government Accountability Office and the National Transportation Safety Board show that high levels of overtime and understaffing at air traffic control facilities have potential implications for aviation safety and the efficient handling of the multimillion-dollar aircraft they guide.

The NTSB has found that errors by tired controllers have contributed to serious runway incursions, where planes stray too close to where others might be moving. If staffing levels decline enough, it could at least lead to slowdowns in airport operations and trigger delays for travelers.

Foote believes that 52 certified controllers, plus 10 trainees, would be adequate to staff LAX around the clock. He said they are necessary given a dramatic surge in air traffic, modernization projects on the airfield that require more ground control and the wider use of very large passenger jets that need special procedures to move safely around the airport.

LAX, which has experienced a 5% to 6% annual growth rate due to a resurgent economy, now handles about 9 million more passengers a year than in 2005.

During the summer, daily arrivals and departures on the airport’s four runways regularly exceed 2,000. This fall, flights have been reaching 1,800 to 1,900 a day, at least 28% more than in 2009.

Controllers oversee it all from a centralized 22-story tower, which has a 360-degree view of the airport. They work eight-hour shifts — morning, swing and graveyard.

During the busiest times of day, controllers must handle about 120 to 130 aircraft an hour, or one about every 30 seconds. The busiest times are 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. The slowest are 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.

In addition to the rising workload, Foote said there are other disincentives for controllers to remain at LAX or to transfer there, including better pay and lower costs of living in other parts of the country.

“I am sending out all the paperwork I can, trying to leave,” said one 20-year controller, who would speak only on condition that his name not be used for fear of upsetting his supervisors. “Let’s say the atmosphere at LAX offers a lesser quality of life and I’m tired of the work schedule.”

The controller said he has been placed on mandatory overtime, which means he must work extra hours when needed. He estimated that he has put in 35 to 38 six-day workweeks so far this year. During the busy summer months, he said, all controllers were on mandatory overtime.

“I’ve never seen it like this,” he said.

To attract more controllers to openings at LAX, FAA officials say they have streamlined training and installed an air traffic control simulator in the tower. Applicants must be certified as controllers at other airports before they can enter LAX’s training program — a policy designed to avoid the high failure rate encountered with inexperienced trainees.

There are also cash incentives, and controllers who move from other local airports to LAX are now allowed to transfer back if they can’t complete the training.

“All are successful and helpful things, but they are limited in scope,” Foote said. “LAX is a difficult facility to staff due to the complexity of airport operations and personnel shortages. With the constant grind day in and day out, air traffic controllers are not willing to do it after a while and we lose trained professionals. This is spreading throughout the entire air traffic control system.”

Nationally, the ranks of certified controllers are at a 27-year low. Since September 2012, the number of fully certified staff has declined from 11,735 to 10,859, of which 3,257 are eligible to retire this year.

However, the FAA was 34% below its hiring goal for 2015 — the fifth straight year it has missed its numbers.

“People are generally retiring sooner rather than later and in higher numbers than the FAA expected. They are saying they just can’t work like this anymore,” said Gilbert.

Contributing to the problem were automatic spending cuts triggered by Congress’ Budget Control Act of 2011 that later become known as the 2013 sequestration. That austerity move forced the agency to shut down its air traffic control academy for nine months.

Association officials say adequate funding is still uncertain and there has been a lack of incentives to attract and keep people at the more demanding facilities.

Gilbert said the association also is concerned about chronic fatigue at the more complex airports and an inability to pull controllers off the line to work on training or to test new procedures and technology.

Last month, association officials went to Congress and asked the House aviation subcommittee to hold hearings into the matter. Committee members have yet to decide to do so.

“About 15,000 certified controllers would be a more comfortable level,” Gilbert said. “We’d like to get to the point where we can meet the FAA’s hiring goals.”

A trailer containing lithium ion batteries was moved off Highway 47 in San Pedro on Friday, allowing officials to lift road closures in the area.

The hazardous fire sparked after a big rig overturned around noon on Thursday at 940 N. Seaside Ave., causing at least one battery to explode and prompting temporary closures of portions of Highway 47, including the Vincent Thomas bridge, authorities said.

Nicholas Prange, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department, said the trailer was moved Friday to a lot on Terminal Island “where it can continue to off-gas or burn, if it needs to, and be less of an impact to traffic and Port of Los Angeles operations.”

“Obviously, that’s a big economic impact that we were trying to consider,” he added.

Officials were then able to reopen the roads around 9 p.m., he said.

The cause of the crash is yet to be determined.

Through Friday evening, Highway 47 was closed from Harbor Boulevard in Los Angeles to the juncture of Highway 103 in Long Beach, according to the California Department of Transportation.

No injuries or evacuation orders were reported as a result of the crash, but the road closures did cause significant traffic issues.

Tens of thousands of heavy trucks and other vehicles pass through the Vincent Thomas Bridge every day; the bridge also connects San Pedro to Terminal Island.

The freeway closure also hindered operations at the Port of Los Angeles. APM Terminals, Fenix Marine, Everport and Yusen Terminals were closed Friday as agencies worked on the scene, although some other terminals stayed open. Traffic was routed away from the area.

“Los Angeles Port Police and senior port officials are working with responding agencies, container terminal operators, union officials and other stakeholders to ensure safety and minimize disruptions,” port officials wrote on social media.

In a statement Friday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass thanked firefighters “for keeping drivers, port workers and the surrounding community safe as this situation is resolved.” She added that her office is staying in touch with leaders of the port and Caltrans about port closures and traffic detours.

L.A. City Councilmember Tim McOsker, who represents the harbor area, introduced a motion Friday asking the port to implement an inspection process for trailers leaving each terminal to ensure cargo is secure.

“This is primarily for the safety and security of our workers and our travelers,” he said. “It’s of lesser importance, but there are multiple terminals that are shut down and will be shut down while this emergency is ongoing.

“And that represents, to the stream of commerce, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars — secondary to life and safety, but also important,” he continued.",NO

Reckless: The Audi is allowed to slowly roll across the tracks. Judge Holt said: 'Had a train ploughed into the car, one shudders to think what would have happened.'
CCTV images taken by cameras at the station show McGrath, who has 16 previous convictions, jump from the car and then run ahead of the moving vehicle over the crossing.
Other images show police in pursuit stopping their patrol cars and running after McGrath although they did not follow him over the tracks.
McGrath of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, admitted dangerous driving, endangering rail passengers and aggravated vehicle taking.
He also admitted escaping from custody after fleeing the dock during his first hearing after arrest.
He was also banned from driving for three years at the hearing yesterday.
A First Capital Connect spokesman said: 'Luckily no-one was hurt. But this man’s reckless action could have caused a major accident, injuring or claiming the lives of scores of people.'
'Terrifying': The empty car came to rest trapped under the barriers. Judge said it is a miracle no one was killed by Ricky McGrath's 'terrifying driving'
Trains were delayed for up to 13 minutes after he abandoned the car at the level crossing.
Judge Holt told McGrath he had an ‘appalling record’ for someone who was still only aged 22.
He added: 'You were not to know whether a train was coming or not. Had a train ploughed into the car, one shudders to think what would have happened.'
Prosecutor Nick Methold said that McGrath had tried to get away by leaping from the moving vehicle as he drove up to the level crossing.
He said: 'The barriers were coming down and the car continued underneath the barriers. He got out of the car while it was still moving and the car went through without him in it.
'It went through the first set of barriers and nearly the second set of barriers when there was a train at the station.'
McGrath was later arrested and brought before King’s Lynn magistrates the next day, but he fled from the dock.
He was recaptured seven days later when he was stopped in a car on the A17 at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire.
McGrath also took a VW Golf on July 27 this year and drove it at up to 115mph on the A47 in Cambridgeshire before police used a stinger device to puncture his tyres and stop him.
He was pursued by police for ten miles and drove at 90mph as he overtook a line of cars, forcing oncoming traffic to swerve.
He also drove at 80mph through a 40mph zone.
Andrew Cogan, defending, said McGrath was a 'realist' and knew he would be going to prison, but he deserved credit for his guilty pleas.
He said 'There is no suggestion whatever there was any driving under the influence of any sort of substance, whether it be drugs or drink.'
McGrath was jailed for four months for escaping custody, nine months for dangerous driving and a further nine months for aggravated vehicle taking, all to run consecutively
He was sentenced to nine months, to run concurrently, for endangering rail passengers and ordered to pay £100 costs.

57,gs_url,"$128 billion and 30 years later: Is California’s high-speed rail going anywhere?
Three hundred and fifty miles might not sound like much, but it's a world of travel options between Los Angeles and San Francisco. You can fly over in a heartbeat, drive through some stunning scenery, or you could choose to travel via train for about eleven hours. Not exactly ideal, is it? That's what California thought when they decided it was high time for high-speed rail.
The Los Angeles to San Francisco route is one of the busiest transit corridors in the United States. Every day, about eleven thousand passengers travel between LAX and SFO, and taking a car along the scenic Highway One or the faster inland I-5 can transform a simple commute into one of the classic American road trips. However, there is no direct rail link, so traveling by train becomes impractical and slow. Even the closest Amtrak mainline station to San Francisco lies inconveniently across the bay in Oakland.
Recognizing these limitations along with the economic and environmental benefits of uniting the state’s largest urban centers more effectively, California authorities proposed a fast rail link three decades ago. If the predictions are correct, the project might take about twice as long as it took to construct the Egyptian Pyramids.
But what does it take to bring such an ambitious project to life, and why is it taking so long? To answer these questions, we've turned to experts Boris Lipkin, Northern California Regional Director of the California High-speed Rail Authority, and Nick Kingsley, Executive Editor at Railway Gazette International. Their expert perspectives give us a 360-degree view of the economic and political challenges interfering with this project’s success.
For a visual take on this groundbreaking initiative, be sure to check out our video.
Faster together: Bridging California's divide
The main reason for enhancing connectivity is the disparity in regional economies between Los Angeles, the tech powerhouse Bay Area, and the relatively lagging Central Valley. These key regions are currently disjointed, with significant travel burdens that negatively impact social and economic interactions. High-speed rail isn't just about speeding up travel between points A and B. It is about integrating endpoints and the spaces in between to transform regional accessibility radically.
As Boris Lipkin explains, “High-speed rail can do is not just connect the endpoints, but also connect the places in between and tie them together. So a trip from Fresno to Silicon Valley goes from being a three-hour trip to a one-hour train ride.” Such improvements in connectivity could draw these diverse parts of the state into a tighter economic and cultural embrace, giving equal opportunities for growth across the state.
Challenges in developing high-speed rail
During a comprehensive interview, Boris Lipkin and Nick Kingsley shared with Interesting Engineering the principal challenges stalling this project.
Lack of precedents and infrastructure modernization
One of the significant challenges in developing high-speed rail in North America is the absence of purpose-built intercity rail systems. Existing services, such as those in the Northeast Amtrak Corridor, rely on legacy infrastructure that supports moderately fast journey times but falls short of true high-speed standards. Modernizing these systems to accommodate high-speed rail involves complex engineering and substantial financial investment.
Integrating rail lines into urban centers
Integrating high-speed rail into densely populated urban centers poses another complex challenge. For instance, California plans to extend the high-speed rail into downtown areas using existing corridors, such as the Caltrain route from San Jose to San Francisco.
However, the last segments into the city centers would not support high-speed travel due to shared tracks with commuter trains. Additionally, geographic hurdles such as mountain ranges north of Los Angeles add to the cost and complexity, making the engineering work particularly challenging.
Planning and regulatory hurdles
Another major hurdle involves the planning and regulatory processes required to develop new railway infrastructure. Unlike in some countries where rail projects can proceed with few barriers, in the United States, particularly in California, the level of environmental clearance and the need to navigate through numerous local administrations create a prolonged and often contentious planning phase. Fierce opposition in regions like the Central Valley makes the situation even more complicated.
Land acquisition and utility relocation
Acquiring the necessary land and relocating utilities represent substantial logistical challenges. For the 119-mile section under construction, over 2300 parcels of land needed negotiation for acquisition, and 1800 utilities had to be moved, with more than 900 in Fresno alone. Often, utility companies are unaware of exactly what lies beneath, leading to unexpected discoveries that necessitate redesigns and further delay progress.
Current progress and technical challenges
Unlike air travel, which provides point-to-point connectivity, rail systems offer the advantage of intermediate stops, which can significantly enhance regional connectivity. The design of the rail route intentionally avoids a direct path in favor of one that enters the Central Valley. This would help link underserved communities to major urban centers. The project aims to boost local economies and address environmental concerns like air quality in some of California’s fastest-growing regions.
The construction on the Central Valley stretch is currently underway, marking a crucial phase in the rail system’s development. This segment is vital as it forms the backbone of the route connecting the northern and southern parts of the state.
Tunneling challenges
A major engineering challenge lies in constructing tunnels through mountain ranges that separate the Central Valley from the Bay Area and Southern California. The project plans include some of the longest rail tunnels in the United States, with the Northern California tunnel extending approximately 13.5 miles and the Southern counterpart close to 13 miles.
These tunnels are absolutely necessary for the rail line, allowing it to get through difficult terrain and maintain high-speed capabilities. However, construction has not yet started, as detailed geotechnical investigations are required. Since tunneling requires extensive planning and preparation, these investigations are expected to take around three years.
Geotechnical investigations
When it comes to Northern California, the complexity of the terrain necessitates thorough geotechnical studies to ensure the viability and safety of the tunnel structures. This phase is critical as it sets the timeline for the following construction activities. It involves thorough analysis to understand the area's geological features and directly influences the design and engineering approach for the tunnels.
Funding challenges
The piecemeal nature of the project’s progress, with some parts under construction and others still in the planning stages, is largely attributed to funding challenges. Unlike many global high-speed rail projects that receive substantial central government funding, California has faced a significant shortfall. This lack of federal funding has slowed certain aspects of the project, making it challenging to maintain a consistent pace across all construction phases.
Public perception and future outlook
Introducing electrified Caltrain services in the Bay Area has significantly heightened public interest and enthusiasm for the high-speed rail project. Boris Lipkin reflects on the visible excitement among the community, noting how the modern electric trains, a first in a 150-year-old corridor, have sparked conversations and anticipation among commuters and families, including young students.
This excitement is expected to boost public support as people see tangible signs of progress and innovation directly impacting their daily lives.
The electrification of the Caltrain service between San Francisco and San Jose represents more than a technical milestone. It significantly boosts the public and legislative belief in the viability of California’s high-speed rail. Nick Kingsley shares a cautiously optimistic view, noting that while full high-speed operations might not commence until beyond 2040, the current enhancements are crucial steps toward bridging regional divides in the long run.
The challenge lies in maintaining and harnessing this public enthusiasm to ensure continuous support. With early wins like the recent electrification track, there's genuine optimism that the high-speed rail project will materialize and redefine how California connects and grows.",NO

CHATSWORTH, Calif. (KABC) -- A Metrolink train crash changed the lives of dozens of people 10 years ago.

Twenty-five people were killed and more than 100 others were injured when a Metrolink train collided with a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth.

A remembrance was held Wednesday to honor the victims and their families.

Victims' families, survivors and first responders gathered near the site of the crash to reflect.

The crash investigation revealed that the Metrolink train operator was texting and missed all of the warning signs before crashing head-on with the other train.

Erin Anderson and Adam Horwitz were at their jobs at a nearby school. They were literally the first two at the scene of the crash.

""I was able to help someone who survived, so I have a positive outcome from my experience of the crash,"" Anderson said.

""It was overwhelming what we saw, but we knew people needed help, so we made a decision to stay and to do our part,"" Horwitz said.

Among the victims was Tina Mosley's mother, Beverly Mosley.

""Let me tell you about my mom. She was this amazing person. Smart, energetic, beautiful, loved by so many people,"" Mosley said.

A Metrolink train heading to Los Angeles from Orange County crashed into a recreational vehicle, which burst into flames in Santa Fe Springs Friday morning.

SANTA FE SPRINGS, Calif. -- A recreational vehicle that was left on train tracks in Santa Fe Springs was struck by a Metrolink train and burst into flames Friday morning.

Authorities say the fiery collision occurred shortly after 5:30 a.m. near the intersection of Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues. Fire crews believe the RV stalled at the Rosecrans Avenue intersection and was struck by the OC Line 681, which was carrying over 100 passengers and was heading from Orange County to Los Angeles.

Dramatic video shared on social media shows the moment the train slammed into the RV and pushed it along the track. The video appears to show people fleeing from the RV, and witnesses told police four people were seen running from the site of the collision moments before the crash.

Firefighters were seen dousing flames that gutted the vehicle and charred a rail car. Smoke from the fire could be seen for several miles.

Flames engulf Metrolink train after crash on tracks in Santa Fe Springs

""We got buffeted around pretty good, and it felt like we might derail for a second or two,"" train passenger Mike Lozano said.

Shortly after the collision, a freight train arrived on the parallel tracks.

""You could hear it coming, and it was coming really fast, you could tell,"" Lozano said.

Another passenger said he braced for potential impact as he heard the sound of the freight train quickly approaching.

""That was honestly the longest few seconds of my life, like when I heard the train horn coming, I was just looking around, everyone was looking around, are we even going to be safe? Do they know that this just happened? Because it sounded like they didn't,"" Ryan Hajek described.

The freight train ran over debris from the crash before coming to a stop as the fire from the Metrolink train started to spread.

AIR7 HD was over the scene, where dozens of evacuated passengers waited in a nearby parking lot while crews battled the flames. Four passengers who suffered minor injuries were treated and later released, according to officials.

""The hit was such an impact on the train,"" passenger Rosalind Carter said. ""I remember being flung into the seat next to me, I hit my head, it was just pretty traumatic.""

The crash caused significant train delays and cancellations. Metrolink offered ticket reimbursements for some customers and advised affected passengers to find their own transportation as ""alternate"" transportation was limited.

Many passengers who frequently ride the train said the crash could've been a lot worse but were thankful for the quick response of Metrolink employees and first responders.

""I got a couple more weeks of work, I'm retiring in December. So yeah, just wanna get through this thing and come out on the other end,"" Lozano said.

968,rd_url,"Even as the Balasore train accident has led to calls for increased spending on railway safety, a look at safety-related budgets for the past nine years shows that Indian Railways has been upgrading its operations with technologies that significantly lower the chances of accidents.
In the nine years that the present government has been in power, Indian Railways spent ₹1,78,012 crore on rail safety, including the budget estimate for FY24, at an average annual spend of ₹17,801 crore. This is 2.5 times the safety spend of the railways prior to 2014.
Since poor-quality of tracks is one of the main causes of train accidents, the railways has given special focus to this work. It spent ₹10,201 crore annually on track renewals between FY15 and FY23, against ₹4,702 crore between FY05 and FY14.
Spending on high-quality rails also more than doubled during the period to ₹13,746 crore a year. Spending on the electronic interlocking system also trebled during the current government’s term.
“Owing to these steps, there has been a significant improvement in the safety performance of Indian Railways over the years. The trend of consequential train accidents from 2000-01 to 2022-23 indicates that the number of such cases has fallen drastically from 2014-15 onwards,” said a person aware of the development.
As per data provided by the railway ministry during the ongoing monsoon session of parliament, the number of consequential train accidents fell from 473 in 2000-01 to 135 in 2014-15 and 48 in 2022-23. There were an average of 171 consequential train accidents a year during 2004-14, and 71 a year during 2014-23, it showed.

581,gs_html,"Monica Chatman, a former Tesla employee, says she was subjected to racist slurs and assigned the most arduous tasks because of her race.

Warning: This story quotes several racist slurs allegedly directed at Black workers at Tesla’s California plant, according to a lawsuit filed against the company.

A single mother was excited to land a job at Tesla. About three years in, she was fired, she said, after complaining that Black workers were frequently called the N-word on the assembly line.

A former refinery worker couldn’t wait to get into green energy. She said she soon found herself and other Black workers assigned to the most arduous tasks in a corner of the factory co-workers called “the plantation.”

An Army veteran was promoted to a fleet manager job. He said he was fired after he complained that his boss called him and two Black co-workers “monkeys.”

In interviews with The Times, three Black former employees described how jobs at the pioneering automaker devolved into personal nightmares due to a pattern of rampant racism and harassment at Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., factory.

Their accounts expand on allegations in a Feb. 9 lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on behalf of more than 4,000 current and former Black workers at the world’s most valuable car company — the largest racial discrimination suit ever brought by the state by number of workers affected.

The three former employees describe a workplace where racist slurs in English and Spanish were often aimed at Black employees by co-workers and supervisors, as alleged in the lawsuit. They say Tesla segregated Black workers into separate areas, gave them the hardest tasks and routinely denied them promotions.

And they allege that when they informed the company about racist treatment, their complaints went ignored or they were fired.

Tesla disputed the former employees’ accounts, stating that the three workers did not complain to the company about racism and that any discipline they received was the result of their own workplace behavior.

“Race plays no role in any of Tesla’s work assignments, promotions, pay or discipline,” attorneys for the company said in a statement. “Tesla prohibits discrimination, in any form.”

‘We are the crabs in the barrel’

Monica Chatman was a single mother working two jobs, as a grocery store stocker and a FedEx driver, when she landed at Tesla in late 2016.

At first, Chatman, then 32, didn’t mind the schedule — mandatory 12-hour shifts, six or seven days a week. “I’m a workaholic,” she said. “I’ve worked since I was 14.”

At Tesla’s orientation, “they said if you do the work, you can succeed and this is the best job you’ll ever have,” she recalled.

For $19.50 an hour, Chatman drove a cart and later a forklift on the night shift, hauling parts to assembly lines.

She was paid overtime but said she became exhausted and resented that she had no choice but to agree to it in order to keep her job. “There was a time where I worked three months straight — no days off.”

African American workers were routinely assigned the hardest tasks, Chatman said, “the work nobody wanted to do — that was more wear and tear on the body.”

Tesla is “modern-day slavery,” she said, echoing claims she made as part of a class-action lawsuit. “And we are the crabs in the barrel.”

Chatman’s first supervisor, a white woman, transferred four South Asian men to a different route after they had worked as a team hoisting half-shafts, carpets and brake lines. She told Chatman to take over.

“I was a skinny 115 pounds,” Chatman recalled. “I said, ‘You’re telling me to do a four-man job by myself?’ Her words were: ‘Do the job or lose your job.’”

At one point, Chatman’s blood pressure dropped and she briefly fainted on her cart. Sitting for a while at a medical station, she still felt weak. She asked to go home to recuperate, but said she was threatened with termination.

So Chatman stayed for what she recalled as “the worst night of my life.”

Besides the unequal assignment of factory tasks, verbal harassment was a daily affliction, Chatman said. Driving back and forth, she said in the declaration filed with the lawsuit, she would hear Latino and white workers, and their supervisors, casually refer to Black workers with the N-word. “You would hear n— this and n— that,” she said. ”It was the norm. It was Tesla’s tradition.”

Chatman didn’t hear Asian workers use the N-word, she said, but they “would make chicken jokes,” a stereotype mocking of Black Americans’ diet.

A Latino colleague who worked as a supervisory lead taunted her frequently, she said. Once, on her way back from the restroom, she heard him bark into a walkie-talkie, “Monica needs to get her Black ass over here.”

Another time, she said, she heard him tell a group of workers, “Monica and them n— up there — they don’t do s—. All they do is sit on their ass all day.”

Reached by telephone, the lead declined to answer any questions.

After that, Chatman said, she filed a racial harassment complaint with Rose Sanson in Tesla’s human resources department. During several meetings with HR, she also complained about job discrimination — not just how she was assigned a four-person shift, but how she and other Black workers were being segregated in “the nastiest, most uncomfortable area” of the factory where it was “freezing cold” in winter, she said.

The Times reached out to Sanson by email and telephone. She did not respond.

Tesla’s billionaire chief executive, Elon Musk, would come through the front of the factory “with his entourage,” Chatman said. “They didn’t want a Black face up there,” she said, adding that Latino colleagues were left up front while Black workers were moved to the back.

After her HR complaint, Chatman said, she was no longer harassed. She said the lead was fired after complaints from multiple workers. But she soon saw him back at the factory, rehired in a non-supervisory job.

As months passed, no matter how hard she worked, Chatman was denied routine performance reviews, which often lead to raises and promotions. She would train new workers and see them promoted over her.

“I was blackballed,” she said.

A year later, in September 2019, Chatman hit a sprinkler head as she was driving down an aisle. That shut down an assembly line for 15 minutes.

But weeks before that, another driver had kept his job after crashing into five sprinklers “pop, pop, pop,” she said, tracking her claims in the declaration. In a separate multi-sprinkler incident, she said, a worker wasn’t fired despite causing a flood that shut down a line for hours.

“I had never had an accident all those years,” Chatman said. “But they were waiting for me to make a mistake.”

In a statement, Tesla said her termination stemmed from the incident, which it called a “serious safety violation.” Tesla denied Chatman was required to work three months without a day off and said she received reviews as well as monetary performance rewards.

The company stated it was the lead “who first complained about Ms. Chatman’s abusive behavior, only to be met with her reactionary complaint days later. Nevertheless, Tesla promptly investigated Ms. Chatman’s complaint and interviewed multiple witnesses, none of whom corroborated her complaint.”

Lawrence Organ, Chatman’s attorney in a class-action suit against Tesla, said the company’s allegations are “the same tactic” it has used to counter other complaints by Black workers, including a case brought by a Black elevator operator. In October, a federal jury awarded that worker $137 million after finding the company turned a blind eye to racial taunts and offensive graffiti.

“Instead of attacking the victims of racism at their facility, Tesla should focus on taking remedial actions designed to end the racist conduct,” Organ said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for Chatman’s time cards, HR complaint or personnel records. Chatman’s attorneys said they also have not gotten those documents from the company.

‘I was at my breaking point’

In 2017, Kimberly Romby was working as a rotating construction safety attendant at San Francisco Bay Area oil refineries, but she wanted a more stable job.

The 38-year-old applied to Tesla and was hired as a materials handler, hoisting 40-pound packages of auto parts onto forklifts and carts, and driving them through the factory to assembly lines.

The job paid $18 an hour and entailed six- or seven-day weeks, with 12-hour shifts. The overtime was mandatory.

“I wanted to be part of the green energy movement,” she said. “It was the future — a career that was going to take me a long way.”

Within weeks, she said, two young Latino co-workers began harassing her with homophobic slurs after she mentioned she had a wife.

The two men would laugh at her and regularly referred to Black workers with racist slurs in English and Spanish, she said. When she objected, they would say “Shut up, n—.”

She complained to her supervisor, who was white, and also to HR, but said she saw no evidence of any follow-up. Tesla said Romby never complained about racial slurs or discrimination.

In March, after Romby had suggested safety improvements on forklift routes that were then implemented, she was honored with a performance award certificate at a staff recognition luncheon.

She said that only made co-workers jealous, and the harassment escalated.

After her complaints to HR, Romby said, she was shifted to a more strenuous route, where she had to lift as many as 100 heavy packages a day without help. Non-Black workers on that route worked in pairs, she said.

During downtime at the factory, when parts or trucks were delayed and line work slowed, only Black workers were ordered to do “general cleaning,” Romby said, getting on their hands and knees to scrub floors and wipe beneath shelves, while white and Latino employees were allowed to take rest breaks.

On the assembly line, Black workers were given the most arduous jobs, such as installing dashboards, she said.

When, as a result, Black workers caused bottlenecks or mistakes, Romby would overhear supervisors say, “Them n— over there … they’re lazy.’ But they were working as hard as anyone,” she said. She reported the slur in her complaint to the state.

Workers called Tesla’s factory “the plantation,” and “the slave ship,” not just for the brutal work pace that everyone experienced, but especially because Black workers were routinely segregated into a corner of the factory that lacked air conditioning and work conditions were most crowded, Romby said.

“There were hardly any white workers over there. It was hell in the summer.”

Romby’s complaints to human resources officials only led to her being shifted to different departments where harassment would continue, she said.

By December 2018, she said, “I was at my breaking point.” She visited a psychologist at Kaiser Permanente and took a month’s medical leave because of stress.

While away, she wasn’t paid because hours after filing papers for the leave, HR emailed her that she was “under investigation for supposedly threatening someone,” she said. Baffled, she asked whom she had threatened, and was told it was someone on the day shift.

But she had worked the night shift.

“People on the day shift told them, ‘We don’t know her,’” Romby said. “It was just a bunch of B.S.”

When she returned, Romby was shifted to a new position. She continued to be badgered by supervisors, she said.

In March 2019, she quit. “I felt like I was forced out,” she said.

Now Romby has a new job working as a welder and mechanic through the local boilermakers union, where, in contrast to Tesla’s nonunion workplace, if anyone harasses you, she said, “We notify our union reps, and it gets taken care of right away.”

In a statement, Tesla said that “Romby had multiple co-workers complain about her unprofessional and threatening conduct.... An investigation revealed she forcefully poked a co-worker in the face two times and threatened to ‘whoop his ass’ because she believed he was talking about her behind her back.”

After two written warnings, Tesla said, Romby complained “her supervisors were unprofessional toward her, but never stated that these supervisors used racial slurs or treated her differently because of race.”

Organ, Romby’s attorney, said she contests Tesla’s allegations, and did so in a March 2018 complaint “where she wrote that she ‘only stood up for herself to be left alone.’”

“Despite its legal duty to produce employment records to Ms. Romby as required by the California Labor Code, Tesla has never provided her with any investigations into her complaints about inappropriate conduct at the factory,” Organ said.

‘That was salt in the wound’

Nigel Jones was 22 when he started working at Tesla’s Fremont automobile assembly plant in 2016. He’d just finished a three-year stint in the Army as a supply specialist, with a posting in South Korea.

His first job at Tesla was simple: keep tanks on forklifts filled with distilled water so they didn’t overheat. At first, he said, “I loved working there, I’m a people person, I love talking to people, and our job was essential because if the equipment goes down, the factory’s not running.”

He did pick up on some ominous overtones as he moved around the factory. He’d overhear white supervisors berate Black, Asian and Latino workers, often directing the N-word at Black employees. “Things like, ‘Tell that n— to get over here.”

When he asked fellow Black workers about it, they told him to think twice about complaining, because, he had been told, those who had taken similar complaints to human resources wound up out of a job.

But he liked his boss at the time, the money was good and “I’ve always been the type who says, ‘Hmm, OK. That just happened. Let it go, keep the positive vibes.’”

Jones was promoted to fleet manager, in charge of keeping the factory’s forklifts and carts on schedule, maintained and repaired. He was originally hired as a contract worker, but then the company took him on as a full-time employee. He believed he was on his way up. “But when I became full time, things started going downhill very quickly.”

He assumed he would “be going to the supervisor meetings and getting integrated” with other managers. “But I was young and Black and didn’t get invited to anything. I was outcasted from the get-go.”

He had ideas for improving the fleet but said he was never taken seriously. “They didn’t like how much the company was spending on equipment, but they wouldn’t hear my suggestions on how to cut costs. I said if you people put more money into training people [to use the equipment properly] rather than buying new equipment, you could save a lot of money. Never once did that start to happen.”

Soon after his promotion, his new boss, a white man, started attending the meetings that Jones was excluded from.

His previous boss had been a good communicator, Jones said. But with the new boss, “we’d miss communications. He wouldn’t be telling me things I needed to know. It seemed like he was trying to make me look bad, like we weren’t doing anything.”

The man called him and two Black co-workers “monkeys,” he said. “Once, he walked away saying, ‘Oh you lazy n—.’ We looked at each other and said, ‘What?’”

That happened in December 2017, Jones said. A few weeks later, he told his mother, Rhonda Lockhart. Reached by phone, Lockhart said she recalled the conversation with her son, which she found troubling. “I had to explain to Nigel that for a manager to call you the N-word, that’s not normal.” She contacted a lawyer, and her son became part of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit.

The supervisor, who now works for another company, did not respond to emails and a phone call from The Times.

Though he feared he might be fired, Jones felt compelled to report the racism to human resources. His first meeting went well, he said. The woman assigned to his department, whom he identified as Tori Tanaka, “seemed to want to help.” (Tanaka, who no longer works at Tesla, could not be reached for comment.) But at the next meeting, there was a different woman who to Jones seemed less concerned. Called in a third time, he was fired.

“They didn’t tell me why, only that I wasn’t a good fit for Tesla, and later I found out it was for safety and attendance violations, which I never once had a write-up for.”

A colleague at a different Tesla facility offered to hire him there, but then told Jones he had been “blacklisted” from the company. “That was salt in the wound,” he said.

Tesla disputes that Jones was fired without warning, saying he “was reprimanded numerous times for documented attendance and safety violations” and for “walking off the job.”

Asked to provide records of Jones’ violations or reprimands, Tesla did not respond.

The company said it has no record of “Jones making any race based complaint during his employment at Tesla.”

Jones said he was never reprimanded for any workplace issue.

He had testified under oath about the prevalence of the N-word at Tesla in two recent arbitration cases brought against the company by former employees. In one case, the arbitrator awarded a Black worker more than a million dollars.

Organ, his attorney, said Jones complained to HR about racism on Dec. 6, 2017. Shortly after that, Tesla “began looking for a reason to fire him.” Jones was terminated on Feb. 13, 2018.

Jones now runs the skateboard company he founded, Spread the Shred. Sometimes he thinks about Musk, who once told employees who were targets of racism to get a “thick skin.”

“He has good ideas,” Jones said. But “if you don’t humble yourself a little bit, it will bring you down the wrong path. You might think you’re doing the right thing, but you’re not.”",NO
1356,gs_url,"NTSB: Hazards not properly assessed in LIRR rail fatality
Written by Press ReleaseThe National Transportation Safety Board issued the final report for its investigation of the June, 10, 2017, Queens Village, N.Y., railroad accident in which a railroad roadway worker was struck and killed by a train.
The accident occurred when a Long Island Rail Road train, on track three in multiple track territory, approached a five-member crew of roadway workers in the Queens Interlocking. The foreman and two roadway workers were conducting a walking inspection and making repairs on track one. The watchman accompanied the group. The fifth roadway worker was clear of the tracks. The watchman noticed the train approaching on track three, sounded a handheld horn, called out to the other workers and raised a paddle as a visual signal to the LIRR’s locomotive engineer to sound the train’s horn. When the engineer sounded the horn, three of the roadway workers remained on track one, but the foreman stepped into the path of the traveling train on track three and was struck and killed. The train was traveling about 78 mph when the locomotive engineer applied the emergency brakes just before impact.
The NTSB noted in its report that the train approach warning method was particularly dangerous for the crew working on the Queens Village Interlocking. Several factors, such as the multiple tracks at the interlocking, trains operating at high speeds in both directions, and the crew having limited areas to clear trains, combined with the additional train traffic due to the Belmont Stakes, increased the risk of the work crew being struck by a train. The watchmen on duty at the time should have given the workers timely warning of approaching trains and all workers should have cleared to the tracks before the train’s arrival, the NTSB concluded.
“Using the train approach warning method, LIRR management did not properly assess the hazards the roadway workers were exposed to while conducting their tasks,” said NTSB Chairman Robert L. Sumwalt. “If adopted, the recommendations highlighted in this report can help to mitigate the risks associated with this work and provide better protection to workers across all railroads.”
Contributing to the accident was the railroad’s and union’s allowance of overtime work schedules without properly considering and mitigating workers’ risk of fatigue. The NTSB noted the watchmen and foreman had consecutive overtime shifts that disrupted their opportunities for restorative sleep during the 48 hours prior to the accident.
The NTSB issued five safety recommendations with two recommendations each issued to the Federal Railroad Administration and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. One recommendation was issued to the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers. These recommendations address safety issues including roadway worker protection, roadway worker on-track safety briefings, management oversight, FRA oversight and worker fatigue.

850,tf_url,"Three people were killed and several others critically injured Wednesday night when they were struck in a crowded intersection by a DUI suspect as they left a children's Christmas concert at a Southern California church.

Up to 12 people, including five children, were struck about 8 p.m. at Vincent Street and Pacific Coast Highway outside of St. James Catholic Church in Redondo Beach. Children had just finished singing Christmas songs for their parents and other members of the church.

Mary Wilson, 81, Saeko Matsumura, 87, and Martha Gaza, 36, all from Torrance, died, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. One of Gaza's three children, a 5-year-old boy, was hospitalized in critical condition.

One other adult also was in critical condition Thursday.

Police identified the suspect as 56-year-old Margo Bronstein (pictured, right). She was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and felony DUI. Bronstein was treated at a hospital for injuries before she was taken to the Redondo Beach Police Department jail, where she is being held on $300,000 bond.

Police confirmed at a Thursday morning news conference that prescription drug use by the driver is part of their investigation.

""At the very minimum, prescription medication is involved,"" said Redondo Beach Police Lt. Joe Hoffman.

Msgr. Michael Meyers was in the church after children had just finished their final song of the holiday concert.

""They were doing all their Christmas songs for their parents and everybody was just leaving the church, so it was a huge crosswalk full of people,"" Meyers said.

Minutes later, Meyers said he witnessed a ""very difficult scene."" The crash left victims' shoes scattered in the street. Injured victims were lined up, waiting of paramedics to arrive. Other victims were still in the street.

""Nobody was worrying about the driver at the time, we had so many people on the ground,"" Meyers said, adding that last rites were administered to some victims at the scene.

The white sedan that initially struck the pedestrians ended up crashing into a second vehicle. The car sustained heavy front-end damaged and both the windshield and rear window were shattered.

Police confirmed a witness account that the driver went around other vehicles stopped at the intersection.

""The crosswalk was full and the light was red. Someone ran a red light and... bodies started flying. It was pretty horrible,"" Marc Zonno said. ""They flew at least two or three cars down the street. It was pretty bad. But I'm hoping everybody's going to be OK.""

Witness Michael Tovar was stopped at the intersection when he saw the crash.

""I saw people flying in the air, and it just didn't compute,"" said Tovar.

Mark Milutin also was in one of the cars stopped at the light. Milutin told The Associated Press the woman who hit the pedestrians, ""just looked completely out of it.""

""It was just a reaction I wouldn't have ever thought someone would have after a situation like that,"" he said.

California DMV

St. James Catholic Church remained open Wednesday night so people could say prayers for the wounded, and church leaders appealed to the whole community to pray for the dead and injured. Members of the church planned to gathered for services at 8 a.m. and noon.

Many of the hundreds of service attendees also were at the Wednesday night concert.

""The community of St. James Catholic School and Parish in Redondo Beach, and the entire Archdiocese of Los Angeles, ask everyone to join them in prayer during this time of tragedy and grief,"" spokeswoman Monica Valencia said.

Bronstein, of Redondo Beach, is scheduled to appear Friday in court. DMV records indicated the Bronstein does not have prior criminal offenses. Her vehicle was equipped with modifications for drivers with disabilities, including an additional passenger-side mirror and hand controls, according to California Department of Motor Vehicle records.

""I know nothing about the woman in this situation,"" Msgr. Meyers said. ""But we are called to forgiveness and to understand. We cannot live our life in anger and vindication.""

A message seeking comment left at a phone number listed for Bronstein was not immediately returned Thursday to the AP.

On Sunday, another driver now charged with drunken driving injured more than a dozen people who were parked and looking at a holiday light display in Alhambra.

Halfway Through 2021, LA Traffic Deaths Are On Track To Exceed Last Year’s Figures
You’ve likely noticed that seemingly everyone is back on the road in Los Angeles. We’ve reopened (for now), and we’re driving places and doing things. But more drivers on the road also means more crashes — and more people killed and injured on city streets.
There was an accepted understanding of traffic safety pre-pandemic: that fewer cars on the roads would mean fewer traffic deaths. That’s not what happened in L.A. and other U.S. cities last year, as more open roads enticed people that did drive to go too fast, leading to a higher rate of deadly crashes and a nearly unchanged death toll from 2019.
And just over halfway through 2021, the number of people killed and injured by drivers in L.A. is on pace to exceed 2020, which was one of the deadliest years on U.S. roads in more than a decade. That’s according to data compiled by the LAPD, which tracks traffic collisions in the city.
Simply put, our streets are dangerous either way: more cars on the road, more crashes, more deaths; fewer cars on the road, more speeding, more crashes, more deaths.
What The Latest Figures Show
Just over six months into 2021, Seleta Reynolds, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, said her staff is observing that “congestion is back [and] traffic volumes are creeping back up.”
“Those really high-speed crashes are maybe diminishing, but simultaneously, we're seeing the normal relationship between traffic volumes and traffic safety kind of reestablish itself,” she said.
Unfortunately, that normal relationship in L.A. means a person is killed as a result of a crash about every 36 hours on average. For the first half of 2021, the city is averaging one traffic death about every 30 hours.
Severe and fatal crashes are up in nearly every category the LAPD tracks. Looking at department data through July 10 this year compared to 2020:
- DUI crashes have risen 20% overall
- Severe DUI crashes, in which a driver seriously injured someone, are up 73%
- Fatal DUI crashes have increased 9%
- Fatal hit-and-run crashes are up 25%
- Severe hit-and-run crashes have increased 20%
- Crashes in which a driver seriously injured a pedestrian are up 45%
- Crashes in which a driver seriously injured a bicyclist are up 34%
- Crashes in which a driver killed a bicyclist have increased 40%
The number of pedestrians killed by drivers this year is “holding about even” with 2020, Reynolds said — 56 people compared to 60 at the same point last year. Of course, the LAPD data reports are a couple weeks behind, and we know more pedestrians have been killed since July 10, including comedian Mat George, who was struck by a hit-and-run driver on July 17.
Reynolds is also concerned about surging deaths in the South L.A. and San Fernando Valley regions, where 100 people have died in crashes as of July 10, compared to 48 deaths combined in west and central L.A.
It’s not a mystery why more people are killed in those communities, she explained:
“We've got a lot of freeways that bisect the southern part of the city. And we've got a lot of arterials adjacent to those freeways, like Adams Boulevard, that have not received the kinds of safety treatments that we've been trying to get to across the city… The Valley is another part of the city that has a lot of really wide, fast streets — I think about streets like Victory and Vanowen — because it's been historically a very car-heavy and car dependent part of the city, due to its land-use patterns. Long distances that people travel to live their lives on a daily basis requires them to drive.”
LADOT does have a slate of improvements planned for Adams Boulevard, which include bike lanes, pedestrian beacons and protected left-turn signals. Construction is expected later this summer and into the fall, Reynolds said.
Reynolds is also bracing for an increase in the share of vulnerable road users — people walking and biking — killed and injured by drivers, especially with L.A.’s children returning to school in a few weeks.
“[It’s] really frustrating,” she said. “We're building the infrastructure as fast as we can, we're pushing for state legislative changes as hard as we can, and we just can't give up… the system bears some responsibility for these trends. We can't just focus on individual behavior — we have to fix the system itself.”
What Will It Take To Make LA Streets Safer?
Traffic safety officials, activists and academics I’ve talked to in recent years basically tell me the same thing: there’s no single magic solution that will curb traffic violence. Making streets safer depends on a variety of changes at both the personal and systemic level.
That includes drivers slowing down and keeping their attention on the road, investing in projects that redesign streets in a way that compels drivers to behave better (which the city has struggled to do), and changing laws to make it easier for L.A. and other cities to reduce speed limits and hold drivers accountable.
“We need people to know that this is a preventable crisis,” Reynolds said. “Their actions as drivers can make the difference and their willingness to be open to big changes on streets that they feel are very familiar can also mean the difference between somebody's family member coming home or not.”

1397,gs_html,"There are familiar calls for increased safety on South Bay roads following the latest fatal collision with a pedestrian.

The latest loss of life took place at the intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard & Hanson Avenue in West San Jose.

""It can be a common crossing area, depending on the risk level you’re willing to take,"" said Chris Giangreco, vice president of the Winchester-Orchard Neighborhood Association.

He returned to the scene Friday afternoon, as vehicles in both directions whizzed along Stevens Creek Blvd.

The night before, he was eating at the nearby Tony Alba’s restaurant when he saw the trouble.

San Jose police said around 8:06 p.m. a woman was crossing the intersection when she was struck by the driver of a Honda Civic.

""So I came out to observe what was happening and that’s when I saw the individual laying in the street with emergency services personnel working on them. And they began CPR,"" said Giangreco.

San Jose police officials said the victim, who has not been identified, died at the scene.

""No matter the location, whether it’s in a residential neighborhood near a business, commercial school, you name it. I think any fatal collision is concerning not only for the community but for the police department,"" said spokeswoman Stacie Shih.

Officials said this marks the 38th fatal traffic accident of the year and the 14th fatal pedestrian collision.

Those numbers are similar to last year at the same time.

Thursday’s collision was a quarter mile from the Santana Row and Valley Fair shopping areas.

City officials said there were already plans to address traffic flow along the stretch of Stevens Creek Blvd where the deadly collision occurred. The seven lanes of traffic make it challenging to get from one side to the other safely.

""Stevens Creek is one of the vision zero corridors that we’re taking a look at narrowing the streets, putting in protected bike lanes, putting in a program we’re calling complete streets,"" said 9th Dist. council member Pam Foley, who chairs the San Jose Vision Zero Taskforce.

City officials said this specific stretch of roadway has only had three accidents in the past five years, and none were fatal until Thursday. They said both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for increasing safety on the roads.

""We want pedestrians, if at all feasible, to use the crosswalk,"" said Colin Hayne, a spokesman for the San Jose Department of Transportation.

Added Giangreco, ""If you’re willing to risk your life crossing the boulevard, make sure you do that when it’s gonna provide you the most amount of safety when there’s the least amount of traffic.""

Police said the driver of the Honda Civic stayed at the scene and is cooperating with the investigation. She has not as yet been charged with a crime.

The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner’s Office is withholding the identity of the victim until her family is notified of her death.

708,rd_html,"A starry crowd of actors/advocates for women’s rights turned out in Los Angeles last week for a dinner hosted by Rumer Willis honoring entrepreneur Cindy Eckert—creator of the “female Viagra” drug Addyi and founder of investment fund the Pink Ceiling, which invests in and advises companies aimed at women’s sexual health.

Guests including Rosanna Arquette; Kelly Lynch; Kathy Hilton and daughters Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton Rothschild; and Tallulah Willis gathered at the Sunset Tower Hotel and sipped on Veuve Clicquot while donning Lingua Franca cashmere sweaters (it was a chilly night in the Hollywood Hills) emblazoned with the call to action and sharing stories on topics ranging from sexual desire to menopause.

“It is an honor to partner with Cindy to raise awareness for women’s sexual health and education,” said Rumer Willis as the assembled crowd sat down to a poolside meal. “I have been blown away by Cindy ever since I met her, and my goal is to continue opening up the lines of communication between women of all ages, sexual orientations, and backgrounds so we can unite and move the conversation about our health and right to desire forward.”

While the guests dined on the hotel’s famous chicken paillard, Eckert took to the floor dressed in her signature hot pink to speak about the challenges she faced bringing Addyi to market. Despite the fact that there were 26 drugs approved to treat sexual dysfunction for men and none for women, Addyi was rejected twice by the FDA, and Eckert said she was forced to jump through multiple hoops, leading to charges of gender bias from the medical community. She also talked about some of the innovations she is currently developing, including a flushable pregnancy test, a device that helps train pelvic-floor muscles, and a decal that can instantly test for a date-rape drug in a cocktail, eliciting whoops of support from Paris Hilton, Arquette, and Lynch.

Lynch, who is involved in a number of organizations championing women’s health care after a car accident left her with a debilitating brain injury when she was just 20 years old, said, “My experience in the hospital was that I was not taken seriously and I had to advocate for myself. We are the majority of the population, and we are not listened to and dealt with in the same way that men are, even down to medical studies. Cindy is so inspiring, and my mission is to introduce her to as many women as possible and see what we can get going here.” The sentiment was shared by the table as they closed out the evening with a pink champagne toast.",NO

You may not know it, but there are wide-nosed, narrow-gauge, Alco-designed, Bombardier-built, 35-year-old DL-535Es running right now in the California desert.
Located two hours south of Palm Springs, and 90 minutes east of San Diego, Plaster City, Calif., is perhaps the ultimate company town with a single raison d’être, which is to house the sprawling U.S. Gypsum facility that gives the town its name. Small as it is, Plaster City also hosts three railroads, one of which is unlike anything you can find anywhere else in the contiguous 48 states. This is the last industrial narrow gauge railroad in America, the U.S. Gypsum mine line that runs north to a quarry in the Fish Creek Mountains, which is estimated to contain a deposit worth 25 million tons of gypsum.
It was the search for oil that first brought speculators to the Imperial Valley in the early 1900s. While they didn’t find oil, it would be nearly 20 years before anyone decided to exploit the large deposit of gypsum that they did find. Operations on the railroad date back to 1922 and, except for the need to occasionally replace worn-out equipment, have continued in a similar fashion for the 95 years since.
On most mornings, one of the burbling DL-535Es with an incongruous large snow plow on its pilot will trundle from the engine facility south of Evan Hewes Highway, build its train, and head the 26 miles to the quarry where the train will be loaded with crushed gypsum that will then be brought back to Plaster City for finer crushing and processing. Depending on housing starts, this process is repeated two to three times a day. The present schedule is three times a day, with at least one Saturday run, too.

USG’s handsome new paint scheme has given operations a brand new look. Engine No. 111 shows off its new paint on the hairpin curve in Ocotillo Wells.
The mine railroad was originally conceived and built by San Diego pharmacist Samuel Dunnaway, who had relocated to El Centro and became aware of a vast deposit of gypsum in the Fish Creek Mountains. (As a personal aside, my great-grandfather was also a San Diego pharmacist who moved to a desert town and tried to take up mining at about the same time, but to lesser results.) Dunnaway formed the Imperial Gypsum & Oil Company in 1920 and the following year began construction of a three-foot-gauge railroad from the mine to a connection with the San Diego & Arizona Eastern in what would eventually become Plaster City. Construction (and later operation) was challenged by drifting sand, as well as sand’s lack of resistance to flooding, but there were no major issues and the line was built as scheduled. It had no formal name, and was simply referred to as “the railroad.”
When trains began running in 1922 there wasn’t a plant yet in what would become Plaster City, so the gypsum was transloaded to standard gauge trains for shipment to processors. Shortly thereafter, Dunnaway sold his operations to Pacific Portland Cement, which took over in 1924 and built the first processing facility where the plant sits today. During this period, secondhand steam locomotives provided power. Sometime around 1945, the railroad acquired its first diesel and the entire operation was sold to U.S. Gypsum. The entire line was upgraded from 35-pound to 70-pound rail, and dieselization was essentially complete by 1947.
When the diesels proved problematic, the railroad turned to leasing Southern Pacific’s own narrow gauge 4-6-0 No. 8 for a few months in 1949. The last hurrah for steam came in June 1952, when SP 4-6-0 No. 9 pinch-hit for an ailing Whitcomb diesel.

The afternoon mine train is barely a mile into its run as it pulls away from the vast U.S. Gypsum processing plant in Plaster City. The line has no official name, simply referred to as “the railroad” by employees.
Why Snowplows?
The DL-535E (also classified as a RSD-35) was among the last locomotives constructed by Alco before the plant in Schenectady, N.Y., shut down in 1969. Seven units were built by Alco and completed by Montreal Locomotive Works in 1969, with an additional three units built by MLW in 1971. The next batch was manufactured by Bombardier in 1982, which had acquired MLW and its designs. The locomotives built in 1982 employed the now-familiar full-width “safety cab” which was adopted by Canada more than a decade before it became common in the U.S. All 14 DL-535Es are powered by a 251 prime mover producing 1,200 h.p.
Why do these desert Alcos have snowplows? The locomotives were originally built for Alaska’s White Pass & Yukon in July 1982, but were never delivered, since the railroad had suspended operation. USG purchased two units (Nos. 112 and 113) of the original order of four in March 1991, only to wreck one about two years later. USG purchased a third (No. 111) at that time. In the intervening years, the WP&Y was reactivated to serve the tourist train and the final unit (No. 114) was delivered in 1994, 12 years after the initial order was placed…

BROOKLYN -- Family members and others gathered at Pier 3 in Brooklyn on Friday to remember the boy who died while subway surfing earlier this month.

Cayden's mother says she tried to shield him from dangerous things like subway surfing but he knew about it from friends and social media.

""It's unbearable. How am I supposed to find peace? My boy is gone,"" Jaida Rivera said.

Rivera's son died while subway surfing nearly two weeks ago.

The heartbroken mother wants answers as to how her 11-year-old left school that morning and found himself on top of a moving train.

""Where's the security? Where's the locked door? Where's the staff? It doesn't make sense,"" she said.

Rivera says her mother dropped Cayden off at Fort Greene Preparatory Academy at 7:45 that morning.

Staff saw him eating breakfast in the cafeteria, but he was marked absent when attendance was taken just 30 minutes later.

According to police, Cayden was riding on top of a G train when he fell onto the tracks at the Fourth Avenue-Ninth Street station just after 10:00 a.m.

Rivera says the school didn't notify her or any other family member.

""He was left in their care, where is the responsibility? Growing up teachers used to be second parents to us. I trusted him with my kids, but they didn't keep him safe,"" Rivera said.

Cayden is the fourth and youngest child to die subway surfing so far this year.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority says it's working with social media companies to flag and remove posts the show this dangerous trend.

Interim NYC Transit President Demetrius Crichlow released a statement on Friday:

""This tragedy is another heartbreaking reminder that riding outside trains is not a game. It should not take more loss of young lives for those who would climb on top of subway cars to comprehend the devastating risk.""

The transit agency has also released PSAs, but Rivera's attorney says this is far from enough.

""It's terrible that the New York City transit authority is not doing a better job of policing subway surfing. Is not doing a better job radioing each other to slow trains down when they see surfers on top. It's really a tragedy that this is continuously happening in our city,"" attorney Rikki Davidoff said.

The attorneys are taking steps to file a lawsuit against the MTA and the Board of Education.

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), in collaboration with stakeholders, proposes to construct improvements consisting of managed lanes, pedestrian/bicycle facilities, and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) elements along Interstate 80 (I-80) and United States Route 50 (US-50) from the Solano/Yolo County line, through Yolo County, and to West El Camino Avenue on I-80 and Interstate 5 (I-5) on US-50 in Sacramento County.
Caltrans, as assigned by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), is the lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the Caltrans EA 3H900 Yolo 80 Managed Lanes Project (project). Caltrans is also the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Purpose and Need
Purpose
The purpose of the proposed project is to:
- Ease congestion and improve overall person throughput1.
- Improve freeway operation on the mainline, ramps, and at system interchanges.
- Support reliable transport of goods and services throughout the region.
- Improve modality2 and travel time reliability.
- Provide expedited traveler information and monitoring systems.
Need
The proposed project is needed for the following reasons:
- Recurring congestion during the AM and PM peak periods exceeds current design capacity limiting person throughput.
- Operational inefficiencies lead to the formation of bottlenecks due to short weaving and merging areas as well as lane drops.
- Inefficient movement of goods and services impedes regional and interstate economic sustainability.
- The corridor users rely heavily on single occupancy vehicles, with limited multi-modal options such as transit, carpool, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities resulting in unreliable travel times.
- Lack of real time traveler information and coordinated traffic communication systems impedes timely response to roadway incidents resulting in secondary collisions and increased non-recurring congestion.
1 Throughput is the number of people moving efficiently through a region.
2 Modality is the variety in modes of transportation. This includes access and multiple options for the movement of people and goods. Examples include access to transit, carpool, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities.
Project Alternatives
This section describes alternatives that were developed to meet the purpose and need of the project. The preferred alternative is 4B.
- Build Alternative 2a: Add a high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction for use by vehicles with two or more riders (HOV 2+).
- Build Alternative 2b: Add a high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction for use by vehicles with two or more riders (HOV 2+) and build an I-80 managed lane direct connector.
- Build Alternative 3a: Add a high-occupancy toll lane in each direction for free use by vehicles with two or more riders (HOT 2+). Single-occupied vehicles would pay a fee for lane usage.
- Build Alternative 3b: Add a high-occupancy toll lane in each direction for free use by vehicles with two or more riders (HOT 2+) and build an I-80 managed lane direct connector. Single-occupied vehicles would pay a fee for lane usage.
- Build Alternative 4a: Add a high-occupancy toll lane in each direction for free use by vehicles with three or more riders (HOT 3+). Vehicles with less than three riders would pay a fee for lane usage.

SMART Train Board To Discuss Recent Spate Of Pedestrian Deaths
Following five recent pedestrian deaths, the board of directors plans to discuss public safety, operation and public outreach.
PETALUMA, CA — The Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit's Board of Directors is meeting in Petaluma Wednesday afternoon to discuss the recent spate of pedestrians who have been killed by its commuter trains. Five people have died between June 27 and Monday. Three of the deaths are considered suicides and two were labeled accidents.
Nine people have been killed by SMART trains since Jan. 13, 2018, and six of them are considered suicides. SMART started its train service between San Rafael and Santa Rosa in August 2017.
The Board of Directors at the 1:30 p.m. meeting at SMART offices in Petaluma will discuss an overview of the agency's public safety, operation and public outreach team's assessment related to the recent deaths in the Santa Rosa and Rohnert Park areas.
Find out what's happening in Petalumafor free with the latest updates from Patch.
SMART General Manager Farhad Mansourian said in a report to the board that a task force evaluates all aspects to determine the circumstances that contributed to the collision. The inquiry includes a review of all federal and state safety standards, devices and warning systems.
""Though no amount of additional enhancements can fully account for human behavior or distractions, SMART continues to evaluate what enhancements or enforcement options can be made to improve the public awareness of the active railroad by the inattentive pedestrian, bicyclist or driver crossing the tracks,"" Mansourian said in his report.
Find out what's happening in Petalumafor free with the latest updates from Patch.
After an Aug. 30, 2018 pedestrian death in Rohnert Park, Mansourian assembled a task force the next month to review all grade crossings with sidewalks or some other path-of-travel across the tracks.
The task force identified ways to improve public awareness of the trains at 30 of the 62 locations it reviewed. The improvements included ""Watch for Trains"" stencils on the sidewalk and pedestrian ""channelization"" that forced pedestrians to break their stride and change direction before
crossing the track.
The SMART board reviewed the suggestions at a workshop in October, and SMART included more features to increase awareness of the trains.
In May, SMART awarded a contract to Ghilotti Bros. Inc. for improvements that could quickly be made at 17 high priority crossings in Petaluma, Rohnert Park and Santa Rosa. The improvements included widening sidewalks, installing fencing and barrier railing and ""Z"" gate style
channelization to raise pedestrian awareness of the trains.
The SMART board Wednesday afternoon will consider approving an additional $249,175 to add path-of-travel enhancements at 13 locations in San Rafael, Novato, Cotati and Rohnert Park. The improvements are to be completed by Oct. 31.

1139,gs_html,"A train collision injured three people in San Bernardino on Wednesday, February 8, 2023.

According to authorities, the collision occurred on Rancho Avenue.

Reports indicated that the truck driver approached the tracks at an unsafe speed when it failed to stop for the guard crossing arm and collided with the Metrolink train traveling eastbound.

There were more than 30 passengers aboard the train at the time of the crash.

Due to the impact, the truck was left in a mangled state, with debris strewn across the railroad.

The truck driver and the passenger were taken to a local hospital and are still in critical condition.

Meanwhile, only one Metrolink passenger sustained minor injuries in the crash.

According to the National Transportation Safety Board, trains collide with people or vehicles every two hours. Train accidents kill thousands of people every year. A total of 600 people were killed, and 2,300 were injured.

According to the National Transportation Safety Board, a train collision is more likely to kill pedestrians than an auto collision. More than half of all train accidents are caused by insufficient or outdated safety features, dangerous crossings, and inadequate motorist warning systems.

More than 7,200 people have died in train accidents in the United States since 1997. Train collisions with pedestrians are the leading cause of death on American railroads, outnumbering all other reasons.

The train is the most efficient mode of transportation. An employee or passenger’s safety is affected by several factors, including the conductor’s skill and maintenance frequency. They are dangerous because they take unsafe shortcuts or are irresponsible.

Accidents involving trains result from derailments, worn tracks, poor security, and disregard for safety rules.

What Should I Do Following an Accident

Once you have gathered information, you should file a police report if it is safe. It allows the police to keep records in one place and information about what happened during the accident in an up-to-date, secure database within the department.

A police officer will usually be present at the scene of an accident. However, if they are not present, you can contact your local police to file an accident report after the fact, either by phone or in person. In this way, if the police are not present at the scene of the collision, they can gather the information and prepare a report afterward.

At least once in their lives, most individuals have used a public transportation system, such as the subway. Although this is a reasonably safe and effective mode of transportation, accidents can still occur.

Although train accidents have a lower risk than many other modes of transportation, they still pose a higher risk of injury or death. In the event of a train accident, you or a loved one may be eligible for compensation.

Our legal team will speak to the insurance company on your behalf to receive fair reimbursement of accident-related medical costs, lost wages, and pain and suffering.

Our San Bernardino train accident attorneys at Arash Law, headed by Arash Khorsandi, Esq., are committed to defending the rights of people who have suffered injuries in train accidents. You can focus on recovery while we pursue the compensation you deserve.

A Metrolink train carrying Monday morning commuters smashed into a truck at a railroad crossing, upending two passenger rail cars and killing at least one person in the truck, which burst into flames.There were about 50 passengers aboard train No. 210 from the Santa Clarita Valley to Los Angeles, said Sharon Gavin, Metrolink spokeswoman. Firefighters pulled injured and dazed passengers from the upended cars.""We have at least one fatality from the truck and we have a number of (injured) victims in the trains,"" Burbank Fire Department spokesman David Starr said.""The  collision has resulted in the derailment of the lead cab car and the next passenger coach,"" Metrolink spokeswoman Colleen Rictor told CBS Radio station KNX-AM. ""Injuries to the train engineer and passengers have been reported.""Firefighters pulled some passengers from the wreckage and set up a triage area to treat the injured.

The freight engineer told police he was blinded by the sun and missed a crucial signal light.


The truck drove onto the tracks at a crossing where the gates were down and the signal lights were flashing. Authorities confirmed the signals were working at the time.Twelve people were taken to hospitals and 20 others suffered minor injuries, Fire Department Battalion Chief David Starr said.Ryan Schatz, 26, of Valencia was seated in the second car when it rolled over.""I couldn't see what we hit ...

The fire was first reported around 7:15 p.m. in the Santa Clara River bottom near Ventura Road and Auto Center Drive, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Flames quickly spread, prompting the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office to issue an evacuation order for Zone 1 at 9:05 p.m., which included the Santa Clara River between Ventura Road and Victoria Avenue.

Though no residential structures were within the evacuation zone, officials urged anyone in the riverbed area to evacuate immediately due to an “immediate threat to life.” Victoria Avenue was closed between Gonzales Road and Olivas Park Drive but reopened just before midnight.

By 11:45 p.m., the Ventura County Fire Department (VCFD) confirmed that crews had stopped the fire’s forward progress. Approximately 75 firefighters from Ventura County Fire, Ventura City Fire, Oxnard Fire, and Federal Fire Ventura County worked to contain the fire, which was confined to the riverbed. No structures were threatened, and no injuries were reported.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Over the years, wildfires have devastated millions of Californians, causing widespread property destruction and numerous injuries and forcing many to rebuild their lives entirely. In 2017, wildfires destroyed 1.5 million acres and claimed 47 lives. By 2019, these fires consumed 277,000 acres, leading to large-scale evacuations. In 2022, Cal Fire documented 7,477 wildfires that burned 331,360 acres, caused nine deaths, and destroyed 876 structures.

As of January 17, 2025, wildfires remain a significant challenge in California. The Palisades Fire in Los Angeles County has consumed 23,713 acres with only 31% containment, while the Eaton Canyon Fire has burned 14,117 acres and reached 65% containment. Combined, these fires have resulted in 24 fatalities and destroyed over 12,300 structures.

850,gs_html,"Three people were killed and several others critically injured Wednesday night when they were struck in a crowded intersection by a DUI suspect as they left a children's Christmas concert at a Southern California church.

Up to 12 people, including five children, were struck about 8 p.m. at Vincent Street and Pacific Coast Highway outside of St. James Catholic Church in Redondo Beach. Children had just finished singing Christmas songs for their parents and other members of the church.

Mary Wilson, 81, Saeko Matsumura, 87, and Martha Gaza, 36, all from Torrance, died, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. One of Gaza's three children, a 5-year-old boy, was hospitalized in critical condition.

One other adult also was in critical condition Thursday.

Police identified the suspect as 56-year-old Margo Bronstein (pictured, right). She was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and felony DUI. Bronstein was treated at a hospital for injuries before she was taken to the Redondo Beach Police Department jail, where she is being held on $300,000 bond.

Police confirmed at a Thursday morning news conference that prescription drug use by the driver is part of their investigation.

""At the very minimum, prescription medication is involved,"" said Redondo Beach Police Lt. Joe Hoffman.

Msgr. Michael Meyers was in the church after children had just finished their final song of the holiday concert.

""They were doing all their Christmas songs for their parents and everybody was just leaving the church, so it was a huge crosswalk full of people,"" Meyers said.

Minutes later, Meyers said he witnessed a ""very difficult scene."" The crash left victims' shoes scattered in the street. Injured victims were lined up, waiting of paramedics to arrive. Other victims were still in the street.

""Nobody was worrying about the driver at the time, we had so many people on the ground,"" Meyers said, adding that last rites were administered to some victims at the scene.

The white sedan that initially struck the pedestrians ended up crashing into a second vehicle. The car sustained heavy front-end damaged and both the windshield and rear window were shattered.

Police confirmed a witness account that the driver went around other vehicles stopped at the intersection.

""The crosswalk was full and the light was red. Someone ran a red light and... bodies started flying. It was pretty horrible,"" Marc Zonno said. ""They flew at least two or three cars down the street. It was pretty bad. But I'm hoping everybody's going to be OK.""

Witness Michael Tovar was stopped at the intersection when he saw the crash.

""I saw people flying in the air, and it just didn't compute,"" said Tovar.

Mark Milutin also was in one of the cars stopped at the light. Milutin told The Associated Press the woman who hit the pedestrians, ""just looked completely out of it.""

""It was just a reaction I wouldn't have ever thought someone would have after a situation like that,"" he said.

St. James Catholic Church remained open Wednesday night so people could say prayers for the wounded, and church leaders appealed to the whole community to pray for the dead and injured. Members of the church planned to gathered for services at 8 a.m. and noon.

Many of the hundreds of service attendees also were at the Wednesday night concert.

""The community of St. James Catholic School and Parish in Redondo Beach, and the entire Archdiocese of Los Angeles, ask everyone to join them in prayer during this time of tragedy and grief,"" spokeswoman Monica Valencia said.

Bronstein, of Redondo Beach, is scheduled to appear Friday in court. DMV records indicated the Bronstein does not have prior criminal offenses. Her vehicle was equipped with modifications for drivers with disabilities, including an additional passenger-side mirror and hand controls, according to California Department of Motor Vehicle records.

Streetsblog reports that due to the light traffic conditions during the crisis, the City of Beverly Hills is now considering amendments to its memorandum of agreement with Metro which could expedite subway construction. Under the revised agreement, Metro would be permitted to temporarily close Wilshire Boulevard between Crescent and Beverly Drives to allow for piling on the south side of the street. Additionally, Beverly Hills would lift some restrictions on construction hours and a moratorium on construction activities during Mother's Day, Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Independence Day.
Metro would be required to conduct community outreach to surrounding businesses and residents to inform them of the revised agreement, according to a staff report.
Streetsblog reports that Metro's agreement with Beverly Hills previously called for 13 weekend closures over an approximately 3.5 month period starting in April and concluding in August. This schedule would put construction activities along this segment of the Purple Line on pace for completion in March 2021.
The revised plan would allow for the piling to be completed in just one month, putting construction activities on pace to conclude in September 2020 - six months ahead of schedule.
The seven-mile Purple Line extension, which will add seven new stations between the Mid-Wilshire area and Westwood, is anticipated to open in phases between 2023 and 2027.

1020,gs_url,"100 years ago in Spokane: Investigators examine evidence in train collision that killed six at Parkwater
Investigators said an unfortunate combination of circumstances contributed to the train crash at Parkwater two days earlier.
Six railroad workers were dead, including the engineers of both trains.
The foreman of the switching crew admitted that “the custom was to hold the work train at Parkwater until the No. 41 had passed.”
On the fateful day, however, he had been told, correctly, that the No. 41 was more than an hour behind schedule. He testified that he believed the work train had “nearly a quarter of an hour” of leeway until the No. 41 passenger train came through. So he allowed the work train to be switched onto the main track. In fact, the No. 41 was not quite as late as the foreman thought.
Investigators were also trying to determine if the No. 41 was traveling at excessive speed when it approached Parkwater. There were some indications that engineer O.W. Southern was attempting to make up lost time.
The engineer’s widow said his last words before he left for work were, “I’m tired of getting jacked up for being late; I’ll bring her in on time tomorrow or bust!” Yet she added that No. 41 had “the clear right of way.” on that track.
The striking shopmen’s union suggested the accident was the result of lax maintenance and safety procedures because of nonunion replacement workers. The union recommended that investigators find out whether the passenger train’s brakes were defective and whether the switch engine’s headlight was missing or defective.
From the fair beat: It was Children’s Day at the Spokane Interstate Fair, and the kids declared it a success.

“It is believed to be accidental,” said Arriaga. “(It is) still under investigation. The victim sustained minor injuries and is expected to survive.”

No further details about how the vehicle seemed to come in the pathway of the train were available as of the publication of this story.

Pickett added that first responders on the scene were treating at least one patient, but they had not been trapped inside the vehicle once the train had struck it.

In a statement released via their Antelope Valley Twitter account, Metrolink officials confirmed that the tracks between Sylmar and Newhall were closed due to Train 225 striking a vehicle on the tracks.

“AV Line 225 to Lancaster is stopped between Sylmar and Newhall due to striking a vehicle on the tracks,” read a tweet from Metrolink sent out at approximately 6:45 p.m. “Delays are unknown. Updates to follow.”

The vehicle, described as a newer model Honda Accord, appeared to have been struck on the driver’s side, flying 10-15 feet from the tracks and through a fence before crash landing, according to witnesses on the scene.

Traffic was delayed in the area as first responders worked to investigate the scene and clear it of the vehicle and any debris.",YES
750,rd_html,"Back in January, I posted the story of 18-year-old Bethany Nava being dragged off a train for ignoring requests to take the foot she had curled underneath her off the seat. In it, I raised questions about whether this was the best we could ask of law enforcement and did a bit of a dive into how and why not everyone feels reassured by the more intense police presence on Metro transit.

“Burn the witch!” came the booming reply across several social media platforms.

Not because I think it's OK for people to put their feet all over seats and ignore multiple polite requests that they comply with Metro's code of conduct. [Spoiler alert: I'm not a fan. So, if you’re looking to read me on how rude teens and/or feet on seats are the beginning of the end of civilization as we know it, put a pin in it. For all our sakes.]

But because I genuinely struggled to understand how people had come to the conclusion that a stubborn teen being dragged off a train and taken away by enough officers to field a baseball team was a) proportionate to the crime, b) the best we could expect from law enforcement, c) what we should expect from law enforcement, and d) an outcome that makes transit feel safer and more welcoming for all.

People love seeing others get their comeuppance - that much is clear. And rude behavior on transit understandably strikes a deep chord in hearts across the city - including, and perhaps especially, among many of those who themselves would never deign to set foot on a bus or a train.

But people had been so caught up in detailing the crimes against humanity her “poopy feet” (as some referred to them) had wrought that there was very little space for reflection on the larger implications of what it was that they were cheering.

Even Metro struggled to carve out space for reflection on the incident. The first statement issued by Metro CEO Phil Washington on January 24 regarding events seemed to indicate that he, too, was troubled both by the images and its larger implications. Within hours, however, the outpouring of burn-the-witch sentiment and what we can only presume were multiple phone calls from official agencies equating Washington's disappointment over the images with a lack of support for law enforcement meant his original statement would be excised from The Source. It was quickly replaced with one reiterating Washington's respect for law enforcement and a plea that we not rush to judgment regarding the officer's actions.

As Metro prepares to refine and implement its newly approved equity framework aimed at centering the needs of lower-income riders of color in the agency's policy and planning processes, it needs to find the courage to revisit the incident and its implications.

Because while the staff report mentions the need to improve transit access for lower-income riders of color and guard against displacement and gentrification that would hinder their access, there is no explicit attention given to ensuring that approaches to the policing of the system do not constitute a barrier to access for those same riders.

The details of framework will surely be filled in as the engagement process gets underway. But the absence of explicit mention of the need for engagement around approaches to policing and accountability is surprising in light of the prioritization of policing (the visibility of law enforcement has doubled since last July), the role Metro believes perceptions of “safety” play in attracting greater ridership, the complexity of the issue, and the fact that transparency around how the system is being policed remains a problem.

The best way to connect the dots between the incident involving Nava and Metro’s approach to equity might be via the most common response I saw any time anyone questioned how the encounter between the teen and the officer played out: “She disobeyed him, what else was he supposed to do?”

What else, indeed.

It is a troubling question. For one, it implies that once a person being engaged is deemed noncompliant, all bets should be off the table.

To that end, a startling number of commenters suggested the officer was too restrained and not rough enough, either with her or the bystanders. Others wanted to see her and those questioning and/or insulting the officer locked up. Inglewood Mayor and Metro Boardmember James Butts, in some pointed remarks at the January 25th board meeting, took it a step further, expressing surprise that the officer hadn’t moved to “smack” some of the people around him as he radioed for help with the “brat.” [Discussion of the incident begins at 24:00; Butts’ remarks begin at 26:03]

Given the abuses of the use of force we’ve all been witness to over the past several years and the fact that “failure to comply” has been used as a pretense to demean, cuff, frisk, ticket, arrest, tackle, or shoot men and youth of color - many of whom had neither posed a threat nor committed a crime - that line of reasoning is deeply worrisome.

But the question also points to the central dilemma created by the deployment of armed law enforcement officers to police etiquette and other civil infractions. Namely, that engagements that begin as an effort to exact compliance, over the course of the encounter, can instead become about the exertion of control.

In this case, the teen’s noncompliance with the rules appeared to be clear [she says otherwise, arguing her foot was resting on her own leg, which is why she responded to the officer with questions rather than “compliance”]. As the situation escalated, however, it became less and less clear what kind of compliance the officer was hoping to exact and more and more evident that his primary goal was establishing control over her, the situation, and the people around him.

In an effort to offer unequivocal support of the officer’s actions, Butts - who has overseen three police departments - explained why this was. In the process, he inadvertently made a surprisingly strong case for rethinking the deployment of armed officers on transit.

The teen, he said, had put the sergeant in an “impossible” situation.

Once she did not comply, Butts continued, the officer had only two choices: leave her alone and show the crowded train car that anyone could do whatever they wanted on transit or call ahead and get officers to meet him at the next station.

The officer, as we all saw in the recording, did neither. But Butts explained that the reason was because the officer “would have [had] no expectation” of resistance.

In framing it in this unusual way - that it was wholly unexpected that an officer specifically tasked with engaging people who were not complying with rules might ever be met with noncompliance - Butts was not only absolving officers of having to have any capacity for de-escalation, he was also arguing that the teen had put the sergeant in significant danger.

A lone officer with a gun on his hip in a crowded train car was now at risk of having his weapon snatched from his holster as he tried to remove the girl from the train, Butts explained.

As such, an officer has no choice but to see everything as threatening: the teen hanging onto the pole because she didn’t want to be dragged off without her belongings, the girl’s backpack (which Butts says shouldn’t have been given back to her uninspected), the people filming on the platform on the side of his service weapon, and Selena Lechuga, the woman who questioned, insulted, and, after being cuffed and led away, spit at the officer.

The officer would have been within his rights to yell and curse at them all to step back, Butts suggested.

“He cannot afford to lose in a confrontation,” Butts reiterated. “He has a firearm.”

On this last point, Butts is not necessarily wrong: for the safety of the officer and bystanders alike, an armed officer cannot afford to put him or herself in a position where their weapon could be seized or a weapon could be pulled on them. And the need to protect against those kinds of outcomes is often why officers behave in ways that sometimes appear counterintuitive or overexaggerated to the public.

But if that is the case, as Metro Boardmembers Hilda Solis and Jackie Dupont-Walker pointed out during their comments, then why was the officer alone (making him more vulnerable)? Why wasn’t a citation given or other options explored before hands were put on the teen? Knowing that an armed officer alone faces such a dilemma every time they engage a member of the public, every possible precaution should be taken to ensure an officer never finds him or herself in a situation where they feel threatened.

Because as Butts himself had said, once the sergeant put hands on the teen, there was no backing down: “He had to have a resolution.”

And, as we all saw, that “resolution” was a teen and an angry bystander being hauled away in cuffs by enough officers to halt a bank robbery and eventually cited for things that had nothing to do with feet on seats.

For many within Metro’s core ridership (Lechuga included), Nava being dragged off the train evokes images of the way their communities have historically been and continue to be disproportionately profiled and mistreated by law enforcement.

Not because of what this officer did, per se, but because of the discretion it suggests officers have to decide which codes will be enforced and how. Because of the fear that that discretion will be used to target youth and men of color as a way to let them know they are being watched, to make them feel less welcome, and to run warrant checks. Because of the fear that those from disenfranchised communities who have endured significant struggle could easily have their forward momentum derailed. Because they already feel criminalized in their own neighborhoods, where they are regularly stopped and frisked. And because of the fear that an encounter over a similarly minor infraction - real or perceived - could end up escalating to something much more serious.

That last fear was realized just this past summer, when 23-year-old Cesar Rodriguez was crushed by a Blue Line train after being stopped for fare evasion at the Wardlow station.

The details of that August 29 incident as yet remain unclear - the family was first told the death was an accident. Later, they heard that he had tried to jump off the platform to escape officers. The Long Beach Police Department (LBPD) statement on the matter offered a third version of events, stating that after the Transit Security Officers - Metro’s security team tasked with checking fare compliance and issuing citations - alerted the LBPD, Rodriguez was detained on the platform for fare evasion. Officers then searched him and found he had narcotics, apparently prompting Rodriguez to try to flee. “Both he and the officer fell onto the platform,” the statement reads. And because “the suspect’s lower extremities were partially off the edge of the platform” as a train was incoming, Rodriguez was struck and trapped between it and the platform.

It’s a horrifying scenario that thankfully has not repeated itself since. But the questions the incident raise - why Rodriguez was searched over a $1.75 non-criminal infraction, how he ended up on the ground, why the family has yet to have any answers, and why such a tragic incident did not prompt more reflection within Metro - are all cause for pause.

We all deserve safety and security and, yes, fewer feet on seats as we try to get where we are going. And law enforcement can play a part in that.

But fulfilling that mandate means recognizing that where some riders might feel reassured to see armed officers on board a train, others might feel unsettled or, as some have expressed to me, like they are living in an oppressive police state.

It also means recognizing that because of law enforcement's history of repression in the neighborhoods where Metro's core ridership resides, there is both a greater potential for more antagonistic encounters between officers and members of those communities and a greater likelihood that members of those communities will be perceived as posing a threat.

And as boardmember Butts' own testimony implied, the fact that officers are armed makes it all the more likely that ""threats"" will be seen to be lurking everywhere and that officers will be all the more inclined to respond accordingly.

In the lead-up to last year's approval of the policing contract between Metro, the LAPD, the Sheriff's Department, and the Long Beach Police Department, there was very little in the way of meaningful engagement around what safety and security for all meant in practice.

Since then, it appears that most of Metro's public engagement on this issue has been with Labor/Community Strategy Center (LCSC) - the group that has filed civil rights complaints and lawsuits against Metro and that has demanded that law enforcement be removed from transit altogether. While the LCSC represents an important voice, they're hardly the only one Metro needs to be engaging.

The approval of a new equity framework affords Metro an important opportunity to revisit the question of what it means to make riders of all stripes feel welcome on transit and to establish a new process to allow for innovation, trust-building, and accountability around safety as the system grows.

Not just because the enforcement of code of conduct violations should not end in scrums. But because all the good work put into centering the needs of lower-income riders of color will be for naught if the presence of law enforcement discourages them from riding.",NO

One person was injured after a Union Pacific train carrying lumber derailed in Colton Monday morning.

""I hoped it wasn't going to come into the house,"" said witness Ashley Caldera, who lives a few hundred yards away from the crash. ""It's scary.""

A Union Pacific train derails in Colton, Calif. March 21, 2022. (CBSLA)

The derailment occurred in the area of K and 5th streets at around 7:30 a.m.

According to a Union Pacific spokesperson, 13 train cars and three locomotives derailed, sparking a fire in the process.

San Bernardino County Fire crews responded and extinguished the blaze. A contractor was injured as crews worked to clear the tracks.

""They were trying to move that car there and they put the hook on a spot that wasn't real strong on that car,"" said witness Tracy Paugh. ""The tractor ripped it off and the chain whipped him. I'm pretty sure it broke his arm.""

The accident is about one mile away from where another Union Pacific train derailed nearly a decade ago.

""I woke up this morning looked through my kitchen window and I just see the train all over the place,"" said witness Zoey Montero. ""Seems like the scene of a movie so very alarming. I think it's the second time its happened but not as bad as this.""

1066,tf_url,"SACRAMENTO — Residents in Sacramento's Land Park and midtown areas are raising public safety concerns around a homeless encampment set up just feet from railroad tracks owned by the Union Pacific Railroad Company.

It's become such a problem that residents say they've seen train conductors stop the train, get off and tell the homeless people to back up.

Residents living near the train tracks say the noise coming from the freight trains has increased significantly in recent weeks. Neighbors say they never noticed the trains and didn't pay them much attention – until now. An encampment is so close to the tracks that trains are forced to slow down, lay on the horn, or sometimes stop altogether

""Someone hops off with a flag and walks by to ensure the unhoused people's safety, basically. Can't have a train zooming by at normal speed with people 5 feet off the track,"" said concerned resident David Philipp.

Union Pacific trains are already loud, but they're even louder when traveling through the tracks near W and 20th streets in the Land Park area. That's because they're blasting the horn and screeching to a stop so as to not hit any of the homeless people living mere inches away from the tracks.

""Every time the train has to stop, it's blocking W, X and Broadway, and all the traffic that's trying to traverse those routes,"" said nearby resident and Land Park community advocate Stephanie Duncan. ""And they're being held up. The trains are idling. People are needing to get to where they need to go.""

""It stops ambulances. It stops fire engines. It stops police cars,"" Philipp said.

It's not just the blaring horns. Residents say they can also hear the clinking together of the train cars when the freight train has to come to a halt. You can imagine how loud and unsettling that is in the middle of the night.

""I put in 311 complaints. Several of us did. That's what we're told in sacramento is put in 311 complaints and we'll solve it. But i haven't even got a call back,"" Philipp said.

Union Pacific told CBS13 they haven't heard of any encampments in that particular area. The City of Sacramento said it's working with Union Pacific and Sacramento Regional Transit to ensure safety and resolve the issue.

""We just want to get back to normal. Let the trains flow. Let the traffic flow. Get people to a safe place,"" Duncan said.

Neighbors in the area wanted to make it very clear they are not anti-homeless. Rather, they are concerned for everyone's safety.",NO
686,rd_url,"Train Engineer Says He Crashed In Attempt To Attack Navy Hospital Ship In L.A.
A train engineer told police in Los Angeles that he intentionally crashed his locomotive at high speed near the USNS Mercy hospital ship in what seems to be a bizarre attempt to expose a perceived conspiracy.
Eduardo Moreno said he doesn't believe ""the ship is what they say it's for,"" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.
The freight locomotive was traveling at a very high speed when it crashed through barriers, plowed under a highway overpass and skidded to a stop more than 250 yards from the Mercy. The ship was not harmed during the attempted attack, and no injuries were reported.
The Mercy is stationed in the Port of Los Angeles to help cope with the coronavirus crisis. But Moreno, 44, told law enforcement officers after the incident Tuesday afternoon that he is suspicious of the U.S. military vessel.
""You only get this chance once. The whole world is watching. I had to. People don't know what's going on here. Now they will,"" Moreno allegedly told a California Highway Patrol officer who apprehended him immediately after the incident.
The CHP officer, who was not identified, described watching ""the train smash into a concrete barrier at the end of the track, smash into a steel barrier, smash into a chain-link fence, slide through a parking lot, slide across another lot filled with gravel, and smash into a second chain-link fence.""
Moreno then attempted to flee the scene, only to be taken into custody by the highway patrol officer.
The attorney's office adds that video footage recorded from inside the locomotive shows that at the time of the crash, Moreno was in the cab holding a lighted flare.
Admitting to driving the train off its rails and toward the water, the engineer said that ""he did it out of the desire to 'wake people up,' "" the U.S. Attorney's Office says, citing an affidavit filed along with the criminal complaint.
Moreno now faces a federal charge of one count of train wrecking — a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.
The freight locomotive was operated by Pacific Harbor Line, which handles rail transportation and related services at the Port of Los Angeles.
The Mercy arrived in L.A. over the weekend, part of a plan to use its 1,000 beds to relieve pressure on hospitals that are struggling to cope with COVID-19 patients. The white ship is a former oil tanker that was converted into a full-service hospital.

670,np_url,"United Airlines and Amtrak will end a decades-long partnership, eliminating reciprocal lounge access and what historically has been a convenient way to earn miles when traveling on Amtrak.

Amtrak + United Wind Down Partnership

Stretching back two decades, Amtrak and Continental Airlines (and later United after the merger) partnered to provide reciprocal mileage earnings and United codeshare service on select trains to/from Newark Airport.

When I lived in Philadelphia, I often took advantage of this to “fly” from Philadelphia 30th Street Station (ZFV) to Los Angeles via Newark. The first segment, obviously, was operated via train, not plane, but had a United flight number and earned miles. Issuing both segments on the same ticket was often far cheaper than buying both separately.

I’m not sure when the codeshare routes ended, but I attempted to book one this evening and it quickly became clear that United is no longer selling Amtrak segments.

Amtrak – United Reciprocal Mileage Earning Ends December 24, 2020

I then noticed a banner on the Amtrak page of united.com that indicated that reciprocal mileage earning ends next month:

As of December 24, 2020, customers will no longer be able to earn MileagePlus award miles through Amtrak.

I also noticed that Amtrak no longer lists United as a partner. Last week, the Amtrak partner page looked like this:

Now it looks like this:

Amtrak – United Reciprocal Lounge Access Ends February 4, 2021

A note went out to Amtrak Guest Rewards members confirming this change:

Benefits With United Airlines Will Be Discontinued

December 24, 2020 wil be the last day to earn Amtrak Guest Rewards points on United Airlines itineraries. February 4, 2021 will be the last day that United Club access will be a benefit of Select Plus and Select Executive Tier members.

Note that Amtrak Select Plus and Select Executive currently have access to United Clubs and United Club members and longhaul Polaris business class travelers have access to Amtrak Acela lounges. I reviewed the Amtrak lounge in Philadelphia here.

United Confirms Dissolution Of Partnership

I reached out to United for confirmation and was told:

United MileagePlus offers members a wide variety of partnerships to help them get the most out of their travel. While our partnership with Amtrak is ending we will continue providing value across the entire travel experience, including working with over 100 partners to offer more travel perks for MileagePlus members.

I’ll address this issue below.

The Amtrak 1:1 “Loophole”

While United Airlines has now tied mileage earnings to fare paid, not distance traveled, the same change was never made for crediting United flights to Amtrak. Points continued to be earned (and can still be earned) at a rate of one point per mile traveled, with a 25% bonus for business class and 50% bonus for first class travel.

There was a huge loophole (of sorts) that many exploited (and may continue to exploit until December 2020). Apparently, those who put in their Amtrak Guest Rewards number earned points on a 1 mile: 1 point basis for ANY United flight, not just Northeast Corridor codeshare trains. So take this example:

Orlando (MCO) to Los Angeles (LAX) is $78 for a one-way ticket, so a MileagePlus member would earn 78 x 5 = 390 MileagePlus miles for this itinerary. However, those who credited to Guest Rewards would still earn on a 1:1 mileage basis, even on the cheapest fares, meaning this itinerary would earn 2,218 Amtrak points, the mileage distance between MCO and LAX.

That’s quite a spread!

United Closed City Ticketing Office In New York Penn Station

One other vestige of the historic relationship between Amtrak and United Airlines was the old city ticketing office (CTO) located inside New York Penn Station. Once commonplace in every major city, this was the final United ticketing office in the United States outside an airport.

I visited the office in 2017, which I thought was such a cool link to the past:

But during my trip to New York last month, I noticed it is now closed:

Why The End Of the Amtrak – United Partnership Is Sad News

This is sad news for me, even though I no longer live in Philadelphia, because I booked the Amtrak codeshare all the time. Many booked train segments as a “hidden city” ticket to take advance of cheaper fares originating or ending Newark (adding the extra train segment often halved the fare). Because Amtrak and United were utilizing totally different segments, you could usually (not always) skip the train segment and the rest of your itinerary would not be cancelled.

I never skipped the Amtrak segments…they were highly valuable to me considering my apartment was a five-minute walk from Philadelphia 30th Street Station (ZFV). In fact, most of my United trips my final year of law school started or ended at ZFV.

Beyond my own personal history, encouraging train travel is good for the environment and actually very convenient in most cases. Perhaps one reason so few people took advantage of this partnership is because it was so badly advertised. But flying into Newark and taking a train to Philadelphia or New Haven or Wilmington (Hi Joe) was really quite easy and a valuable benefit of staying loyal to United.

I hope that as Amtrak invests in its next generation of Acela trains, like the car pictured above, it will again partner with United or another airline. Encouraging more train travel is a sensible alternative, at least in the Northeast Corridor, to shorthaul flights.

CONCLUSION

United and Amtrak will end reciprocal mileage earning on December 24, 2020 and reciprocal lounge access on February 4, 2021. This marks the end of a long partnership. Hopefully one day it will return in some form.

654,gs_url,"One understandable impulse for those of us cooped up staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic is to use the time to address long neglected tasks. Years ago I placed in a file of my email account various ideas for Streetsblog posts. I sorted through the file during a recent session of my weekly writing group (which has transitioned from in person to via Slack and Zoom).
Some ideas were still relevant but quite a few I deleted. One that had promise was a reading list for activists. While at first it didn't seem overly significant suddenly in a flash it came to me how useful it could be, especially for people who after months binge streaming Tiger King and such could use a fresh diversion. And of course this was before the recent pandemic second wave and concomitant new stay at home orders
While I am unhappy at how long composing the list took me, I see its appearance now as a happy accident that allows it to also function as a holiday gift guide for urbanists, activists and others that are transit-oriented.
The list consists of works I have found especially enlightening for my education as a transportation activist, organized in a few broad categories.
First up is the book I am currently reading, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1960) by Jane Jacobs. This is a classic of planning literature I have long wanted to read. So far I have worked my way to the three-quarters point.
My impression so far is it is disarmingly personal, not academic. No profusion of end notes or jargon. It offers thoughts on the way great cities work based on observation, mostly of New York but also of other cities. The supportive insights of fellow activists, elected officials and planners help round it out.
Especially of interest is its pitiless critique of urban planning orthodox as it stood in 1960, the year the book was published. Jacob's key insight is the disconnect between theory and reality. Planners fixated on pet theories and strategies; this repeatedly led to round peg in a square hole planning efforts as the professionals failed to take into account empirical evidence of how cities actually work.
The writing is evocative, a testament to the passion Jacobs brought to the topic. Especially memorable is her description of an impromptu street party that spontaneously erupted when a mysterious bagpiper appeared in her neighborhood. And you thought flash mobs were strictly a feature of the digital age.
Looking forward to further insights as I keep working my way through it.
REGIONAL HISTORY
The Reluctant Metropolis: The Politics of Urban Growth in Los Angeles (1997) by William Fulton
A best books of the year list put together by KPCC host Larry Mantle years ago made me aware of Fulton's book. I read it fairly early in my education as an activist and found it illuminating on many aspects of the region. Like how not just developers but also neighborhood associations have played a huge role in how growth has (or sometimes has not) occurred. Think of the long-stalled Hollywood Target as a contemporary example.
There is an excellent chapter on Metro through the mid-1990s. Another outstanding chapter gives a blow by blow account of the war between Oxnard and Ventura over which would end up with a regional mall. This illustrates why, after Prop 13, cities prize sales tax generating retail businesses; the money stays with the city whereas property tax proceeds go to Sacramento to be divvied up and eventually a slice subvented back to the originating city. Also revealing is Fulton's explanation of the source for behind the scenes details of the maneuvering by key players which makes the chapter so vivid: lawsuits! Filings that become a part of the public record often expose the inner workings of public and private parties, details that otherwise would never see the light of day.
Even 20+ years after being published it is still well worth seeking out.
Los Angeles and the Automobile: The making of a Modern City (1987) by Scott Bottles
Mention by a friend of Bottles' chapter on the fight between the railroads and the city of Los Angeles over having a Union Station (which the former vehemently opposed while the latter just as vehemently pursued) made me track down a copy.
Extremely well researched, it documents the facts behind the emergence of Los Angeles' ""love affair with the automobile"" from the early 20th century onward - and the simultaneous decline of public transportation. For instance: in the 1930s, while repeated efforts to fund mass transit failed, bond measures were passed to straighten and widen streets.
Second edition of The History of the Los Feliz Improvement Association: 1916-2000
As I mentioned, Fulton highlights the power of neighborhood associations. Bottles likewise gives their role significant attention. Among the oldest is the Los Feliz Improvement Association, founded in 1916.
To learn more about the Association I bought a copy of the second edition of its history. The main source for it was a barrel discovered in one member's garage in which decades of records had accumulated. While unfortunately now out of print, copies are available from book dealers via Alibris and AbeBooks. I found it quite interesting.
I live on Wilshire Boulevard. For a long period I worked in a historic building on Wilshire. Before the pandemic Wilshire was my main arterial for access to shopping, entertainment, eating out, etc. But for much of that time I didn't know who Wilshire was or the history of the street.
When I received a bookstore gift certificate for Christmas I decided to rectify that and special ordered this book.
And what a story it turned out to be! Gaylord Wilshire was a self-promoting Socialist developer. His sole role in the creation of the street that bears his name was donating to the city the initial dirt path (which he named Wilshire) through a bean field between MacArthur and Lafayette parks. And curiously one provision of the gift was a prohibition of any streetcar service, which is why neither the Red nor Yellow streetcar systems ever had a line along Wilshire.
As the city grew westward successive developers extended the Boulevard as part of their street grids. In time it ran all the way to the Pacific. The book's remarkable photos include a number from the period when Wilshire had stretches going through undeveloped open space and was lined with an unbroken series of billboards. Downright surreal.
After reading this, a trip on the Metro 20 local, 720 rapid or Big Blue Bus 2 isn't the same - as now you know the full story behind the sights, block by block.
POLITICS
A Rage for Justice: The Passion and Politics of Phillip Burton (1997) by John Jacobs
One year I checked out from the library - where I was then working - some books on California politics to read over the holiday break and learn more about how things work. This book was a true revelation for an amateur policy wonk like myself.
Phillip Burton was an unapologetic progressive who, after being elected as a congress member representing a district in the Bay Area, mastered the arts of compromise and alliances to achieve his goals.
One of his secret weapons was voter patterns. Often he successfully lobbied colleagues to support legislation by asserting that doing so would shore up support in a portion of their district where they suffered from weak poll numbers. He was in his glory during the decennial redrawing of districts (aka reapportionment). It is a process that mostly flies below the radar of the public but to politicians is paramount as it has a considerable impact on their chances for re-election.
Shortly before his unexpected death, Burton found himself facing a strong re-election challenger in 1982; moderate Milton Marks was recruited by the Republican Party which had targeted Burton for defeat. The account of that hard fought election is a high point of the book.
I realize polarization makes it easy to dismiss these political methods as defunct but actually cutting deals is still a fine art practiced on occasion (an example is the original pandemic stimulus package) and thus the lessons of this book are still relevant.
The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York (1974) by Robert Caro
I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and several times when I traveled north to visit family did so on Amtrak's Coast Starlight which is a two day journey from Los Angeles to Seattle.
To pass the time on one trip I brought along Caro's massive (both in page count and reputation) tome. While it nearly took all four days of travel there and back to finish, the narrative was so riveting it was impossible to put down. So much so it took an effort to occasionally look up and take in the splendid scenery this route offers.
Moses reigned as New York's master builder of parks, expressways, tunnels, beaches and bridges from the 1920s through the 1960s. A protege of Governor Al Smith, he mastered the byzantine ways of the New York state legislature before becoming involved with New York City politics. While originally an idealist reformer the allure of power transformed him into the ultimate insider, wielding vast sway over infrastructure via simultaneously chairing multiple city and state public commissions and authorities.
Often described as Machiavellian, he knew how to get things done. His antipathy toward public transit and championing of expressways transformed the New York landscape (for the worse in the eyes of many including the aforementioned Jane Jacobs).
One lesson to glean is there is nothing more powerful than a bureaucrat who can draw on an independent source of revenue (in the case of Moses, tolls from bridges and tunnels).
Amid the persistent rumbles of a likely eventual trillion plus federal infrastructure initiative it is instructive to note how Moses thrived when a similar effort was launched during the Great Depression. He had a leg up on other cities when competing for federal funds by being able to offer numerous shovel-ready projects that, if funded, could quickly start construction and produce jobs, the main purpose of the funding.
One often reads online carping that plans and studies are fifth wheels. They are actually necessary parts of the process and when the stars align give a region a competitive advantage to secure funding that becomes available.
As befits an epic, the downfall of Robert Moses was high drama, involving such juicy ingredients as a world's fair, billionaires, kids' playgrounds, and free Shakespeare in Central Park.

Dead End: Suburban Sprawl and the Rebirth of American Urbanism (2014) by Ben Ross
My decades of involvement with public transit advocacy have included making the acquaintance of fellow advocates around the country. Among these is Ben Ross, one of the prime movers behind the Action Committee for Transit. Overcoming numerous obstacles, ACT advocated for a light rail line in Montgomery county near the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. That line is now under construction - and known as the Purple Line.
Ross has written an incisive deconstruction of sprawl, for which Damien Newton provided a nice overview when Ross was in Los Angeles for a book signing in 2014.
A recurring motif is homeowners' pervasive fear of apartment dwellers. Ross documents numerous examples of the visceral reactions single family dwelling unit neighborhoods have to the possibility of apartments being built in proximity to them. This aversion inevitably collides with the trend of cities being transformed through new urbanism/mixed use developments/densifying transit corridors.
A good solid work on an important aspect of the modern landscape.
I used to think that social concerns shaping transportation was a contemporary phenomenon. But I learned different by reading Derrick's book.
This details the story of the dual contracts signed in 1913 which more than doubled the size of the New York subway system - from 296 miles to 618 miles.
One of the factions advocating for the expansion were social reformers; they saw rail lines into the sparsely populated outer boroughs as facilitating the escape of the urban poor from Manhattan slum tenements to affordable housing - via new construction driven by the proximity of these extended subway lines. Starkly illustrating this is a photo in the book showing an elevated rail line being built through an empty field. To paraphrase the film Field of Dreams 'If you build it they will come'. Proof for the strategy's success is provided by an aerial shot of a sea of single family dwellings in modern Queens at the start of the 1970s TV series All in the Family.
Me and the Model T (1965) by Roscoe Sheller
The automobile becoming the primary means of personal transportation - in the early 20th century - was a slow and at times chaotic process. The transition from horse to horseless carriage is documented in this amusing and colorful memoir.
Sheller lived in Sunnyside, a small town in the Yakima Valley of Central Washington state not too far from my hometown. In 1915 he had a chance to ride in Henry Ford's Model T and soon after joined the local dealership as a salesman.
His task was to convince farmers - used to a horse and buggy - of the benefits and advantages of owning a Model T. For the new owners he provided driving lessons (and in some cases also for the owner's spouse and offspring). This was often a harrowing experience. ""Whoa!"" they would yell while pulling on the steering wheel when trying to stop. The process involved dented fenders, broken headlights and, for the instructor, shattered nerves.

Willie Brown: A Biography (1997) by James Richardson
This was one of the other California politics books that I read one holiday season. The full book is now online - posted by the University of California Press.
A portrait of Brown's 30 years in the California State Assembly - 15 of which as its Speaker. Brown excelled at making deals. As the author notes, Brown was fixated on being present at the press event where the deal was announced and duly lauded for helping make it happen. Being a pragmatist not wedded to a firm ideology gave him flexibility when mediating/negotiating. Much like the book on Robert Moses, this is unvarnished realpolitik through mastery of process and shrewd handling of political allies and opponents.
Los Angeles: Structure of a City Government (2006) by Raphael J. Sonenshein
The title says it all. It is the latest edition of a work - sponsored by the Los Angeles League of Women Voters - on the government of the city of Los Angeles. Sonenshein, the author of this revision, is a political scientist with an impressive resume and a thorough familiarity with the local civic culture. Step by step he guides the reader through the intricacies of City Hall and the structure of local government in Los Angeles. I learned more than a few things from reading it.
Another nuts and bolts reference. The about section of the website explains it to be, ""... devoted to providing statistical and narrative information about the people, places and stories that make up the incredible panorama of Los Angeles County."" It is easy to forget Los Angeles County contains 88 incorporated cities. This is a tool to learn more about them.
'Why does it cost so much to build rail lines?' is a perennial question one encounters from the public and also many activists. One can cite economic, regulatory and social dimensions in such a discussion. But a much more lively and engaging answer is to suggest reading McSpedon’s article as a case study. From 1985 to 1994 McSpedon oversaw rail construction in Los Angeles County. From that perch he had a front row seat to bear witness to the travails of constructing the Blue Line (now known as the A Line) between Los Angeles and Long Beach.
And what travails they were! Building in an active railroad corridor, while ensuring the existing freight service was not disrupted, predictably proved expensive. But one of the other problems stemmed from jurisdictional opportunism. McSpedon shares his dictum regarding this: Lurking behind any neglected and underutilized railroad corridor are an infinite number of painstakingly conceived but as yet unfunded, improvement projects.
The upshot is that the affected cities (plus Los Angeles County in unincorporated areas) dusted off plans for any desired improvement remotely near to the project right-of-way. These included “…upgrades of adjacent streets and sidewalks, installation of new street lighting, computerized traffic signals and signage, addition of landscaping, construction of new fences and retaining walls, construction of new street crossings across the right of way, and closure of certain existing crossings.” All of the aforementioned were loaded onto the project budget.
My favorite example of unexpected costs is when plans to reuse an existing bridge collided with regulatory standards and other considerations. As a result, ""what started out as an apparent opportunity to reduce project costs by utilizing an existing grade separated crossing structure has led ultimately to a decision to demolish the entire four-track railroad bridge and to construct a new double-tracked Southern Pacific structure as well as two new single-tracked light rail aerial structures—all to current design standards. This is the most cost-effective solution to all of the problems identified.”
And that is all I have for now. What good books have you read lately?

An environmental impact report released by Caltrans sheds new light on plans to rebuild the stretch of Lincoln Boulevard which crosses over Ballona Creek.
This .61-mile segment of Lincoln Boulevard, which is a part of Pacific Coast Highway, spans between Fiji Way to the north and Jefferson Boulevard to the south. The project, billed as a means to improve circulation and safety, would involve the construction of an additional southbound travel lane, while also adding sidewalks, protected bicycle lanes, lighting, landscaping, and signage along the length of the corridor. This option would also require the demolition and replacement of the existing Culver Boulevard bridge which crosses Lincoln, as well as a widening of the Lincoln Bridge over Ballona Creek.



Current view of Lincoln Boulevard looking northwest toward Ballona CreekCaltrans

This build option for Lincoln would also relocate the street's centerline approximately 50 feet to the east, and provide a striped center median which could accommodate a center-running transit line. Measure M, approved by L.A. County voters in 2016, includes a provision for an 8.8-mile bus rapid transit line along Lincoln between LAX and Downtown Santa Monica - albeit with a far-off opening date of 2047. That corridor could be converted to light rail in the even more distance 2060s.
The roughly $89-million project is projected to be built over a roughly three-year period, commencing by January 2027 and concluding by December 2029. A portion of that project cost would be covered by $2.5 million in developer impact fees allocated to Lincoln Boulevard by former 11th District City Councilmember Mike Bonin in 2022.

The proposed expansion and redesign of Lincoln comes more than two decades after the California Coastal Commission rejected a prior proposal to widen the same stretch of Lincoln to accommodate expected new traffic from the buildout of Playa Vista and the LAX master plan. However, that plan had called for a larger right-of-way - upwards of 174 feet in the original plan versus 130 feet in the current proposal - and included smaller sidewalks and bike lanes, without connections to the Ballona Creek bike trail or Culver Boulevard.

766,gs_url,"Workers had cleared all the wrecked train cars blocking a major West Coast highway by Wednesday morning, two days after the Amtrak train derailed in Washington state while speeding onto a bridge, state transportation officials said.
It took about a day longer than hoped, but crews had carted off the biggest chunk by the afternoon: the 270,000-pound locomotive involved in the Monday morning rush-hour crash in the city of Dupont, which killed three train passengers and sent about 100 people to hospitals.
But the biggest chunk still remained: the 270,000-pound locomotive involved in the Monday morning rush-hour crash in the city of Dupont, which killed three train passengers and sent about 100 people to hospitals.
The affected southbound stretch of Interstate 5 will remain closed indefinitely, the Washington State Department of Transportation has said.
“Even once the locomotive is removed we will need to clear debris,” the department said in a statement on Wednesday. The roadway may also need repairs, the agency said.
The train was travelling 80 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone, when it careened off an overpass onto the highway below, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
NTSB member Bella Dinh-Zarr confirmed during a Tuesday evening press conference that the Amtrak Cascades 501 train, which was carrying 83 people when it derailed Monday, had not been outfitted with “positive train control.”
“Positive train control” is an overlay system designed to stop train derailment, collisions and speeding accidents by enforcing speed control.
Congress mandated all major rail lines be outfitted with PCT in 2008, after two trains in Los Angeles collided head-on, NBCNews reported. The original deadline was the end of 2015, but Congress extended implementation until the end of 2-18, due to the up to $22.5 billion price tag and the complication.
“Could that speed control have made a difference? We don’t know that for sure,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said during a conference.
“None of us, including myself, should be making conclusions about the causes of this accident at the moment,” he added.
Dinh-Zarr, meanwhile, emphasized the NTSB will not release a cause of crash at least until completion of the on-site investigation. She did, however, detail some findings.
Dinh-Zarr said the train’s emergency brake had not been activated by the train’s engineer, but was automatically activated during the accident. At the time of the accident, the engineer was not alone in the cab. A conductor familiarizing himself with the territory accompanied the engineer, while the train’s conductor was intermingling with passengers.
“Distraction is one of our most wanted on our list of priorities. It is protocol to look at all cell records of all crew members,” Dinh-Zarr said.
NTSB and the lead investigator plan to thoroughly interview all crew members once they are medically fit. In the coming days, NTSB will continue to collect information from data recorders, as well as two on-train cameras that have sustained heavy damage.
The on-site investigation could last another seven to 10 days, after which point NTSB will likely still need more time before determining the cause of the crash.
The derailment placed Amtrak, the country’s main passenger rail service, under renewed scrutiny following a series of fatal incidents.
At least two of the three people killed in the derailment were transit enthusiasts who wanted to ride the inaugural run along the new route. A medical examiner is still trying to identify the third victim through fingerprints, the Washington State Patrol said on Wednesday.

1089,gs_html,"A last-minute witness jolted the trial of a man suing Amtrak and a Marysville hospital after his legs were cut off by a passing train as he lay on the tracks early on Christmas Eve 2016.

Joseph Nevis is suing Amtrak, Marysville’s Rideout Hospital and an emergency room doctor for $32 million over the incident, an event that occurred after Yuba City police found him on the street and had him taken to the hospital as being too intoxicated for jail.

Nevis has testified that he has no memory of what happened to him that night or how he ended up on the train tracks after leaving the hospital, but a family friend testified in Sacramento federal court Tuesday that Nevis told her years ago he was trying to kill himself.

“I asked him how it happened, how something like that could happen,” Emily Hilbers, a 27-year-old resident of the Sutter County community of Meridian, said under oath before U.S. District Judge Dale Drozd and assembled attorneys — but not the jury. “He said he intended to take his life.”

Hilbers testimony came as attorneys had been planning to wrap up their cases after three weeks and deliver closing arguments Wednesday morning.

But that schedule was upended when the judge agreed to allow Hilbers to come into the courtroom and tell her story with the jury dismissed for the day.

Nevis attorney Raymond McElfish objected to allowing Hilbers testify, arguing that lawyers for the defense have had years to depose Nevis family members and friends and now were trying to bring in a new witness long after the pre-trial deadline.

“This could potentially be mistrial material, given its explosive nature,” McElfish told Drozd.

But Rideout attorneys Bob Zimmerman and Chad Couchot argued that there was no way they could have known about Hilbers and her claims before now, saying they first learned of her story this week after retrieving a voicemail that had been left for Zimmerman on Oct. 11.

In that voicemail, Hilbers said she had some information about a Rideout case, but did not specify which case she was calling about. Once Zimmerman spoke to Hilbers, the voicemail was turned over to McElfish, and Couchot notified the judge late Monday that they had a witness with information Nevis may have been intent on suicide the night he lost his legs.

Drozd ultimately called Hilbers into court just before 5 p.m. Tuesday, had her sworn and allowed lawyers to begin questioning her to determine whether she should be allowed to testify in front of the jury while Nevis watched sitting near his service dog, Charlie.

Under questioning from Zimmerman, Hilbers said she knew nothing about the lawsuit until she heard someone talking about it on the “Armstrong & Getty” radio show.

“I pieced it together and thought, ‘Oh, no, he’s suing for ($32 million),” she said, adding later that she felt “as though I was watching someone that I know steal” millions from the defendants.

Hilbers said she knew Nevis because she was best friends growing up with his half-sister, Samantha, and that sometime after the accident she was riding with the sister when Nevis called asking for a ride.

Hilbers said that occurred sometime between the December 2016 train incident and June 2017, pegging the timeline to an entry she had made in a journal at the time.

Nevis’ sister was driving, with Hilbers in the passenger seat, as they picked Nevis up in Yuba City for the 15-minute ride, she said.

“That was the first time I had seen him with no legs,” she said. “I said, ‘You have no legs. What happened?’ And I thought I shouldn’t say things like that, I should be more sensitive. He said, ‘I got ran over by a train.’”

Hilbers said she remembered Nevis talking about the pain he endured and how he woke up on the train tracks with no legs and called out to a passerby for help.

“It was heart-wrenching...” she said. “It broke my heart.”

Hilbers testimony could be critical in a case where Nevis’ attorney is blaming the hospital, Dr. Hector Lopez and a nurse for allowing Nevis to leave the hospital that night, and for Amtrak’s engineers for not seeing Nevis on the tracks hours later in time to stop the passenger train.

Hilbers emphasized that she cannot remember Nevis’ exact words, but said she had no doubt about what he told her.

“It was clear from our conversation that he meant to take his own life and it didn’t work out in his favor,” she said. “He intended to commit suicide that evening.

“He told me that, and it’s not something you forget.”

Once McElfish got his turn to question her, he asked whether the ride occurred late at night, on a weekend, or whether she had been drinking at the time.

Hilbers said she had not consumed any alcohol, and that the ride was in the middle of the day.

“What I know is that he told me his intent was to take his life,” she said. “I asked him, how did he end up on the train tracks? It doesn’t make sense. His answer was he intended to take his life.”

“That could have meant anything,” McElfish replied, saying Hilbers was making assumptions. “It could have meant jumping off a bridge. It could have meant taking drugs.”

“My only goal in this is honesty,” Hilbers said, adding that she called Nevis’ sister Monday night to tell her she would be testifying.

“Because I wanted to be up front about speaking the truth,” she said. “I was hoping she would tell the truth, too.

“When I spoke to Sam she didn’t say I’m wrong for doing this. She didn’t say I’m a liar. Her only concern was, he’s not going to get that much money. Don’t testify. Let it go.”

“In all seriousness, there is nothing to gain and everything to lose by being here,” she added.

Drozd ultimately ordered her to return to court Wednesday morning to testify in front of the jury, but only after she assured him that she was not mistaken about what Nevis said.

“You’ve taken an oath,” the judge said somberly. “This is a very important matter. This case has been hanging for over five years. We’ve been in trial for three weeks.

“These are all important things. This is not about radio broadcasts. This isn’t about what you read in the newspaper. This is very important.”

“Your honor, I am positive,” Hilbers said. “There is no doubt in my mind that he told me he intended to take his life.”

The trial resumes Wednesday morning with Hilbers’ testimony, then three rebuttal witnesses McElfish said he intends to call. Closing arguments could begin Wednesday afternoon.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CA — North County Transit District announced Thursday it has agreed to purchase 11 new commuter rail cars for the COASTER service for $43 million from Bombadier Transportation.



The agreement was signed last week following authorization by NCTD's Board of Directors and funding by the California Transportation Commission. With the purchase of these rail cars, NCTD officials say the transit agency will be in a position to significantly increase service frequencies to 30-minute headways and begin repairs and replacements to the current COASTER coaches and cab cars over the coming years.

The order includes eight coaches and two cab cars and will support the San Diego Association of Governments' 2050 Revenue Constrained Regional Plan for increased service levels. NCTD also has the option in the contract to purchase up to 27 additional cars. NCTD currently operates a fleet of seven locomotives and 28 BiLevel cars in COASTER operations from Oceanside to downtown San Diego. COASTER rail service currently provides 22 regularly scheduled weekday trips and eight weekend trips. Time between trains vary from 45 minutes to an hour during peak periods and more than 3.5 hours during the non-peak period.

""As we look to the future, NCTD will be in a position to continue moving forward, offering customers an outstanding riding experience and providing increased service along the rail line,"" said Tony Kranz, NCTD board chair and Encinitas councilman. ""With these two additional trainsets in the fleet, commuters will have a number of train runs throughout the day to meet their needs, and that really makes the decision to try transit an easy one."" With the addition of the expansion equipment, NCTD will be able to increase frequencies of trains. Peak-period frequencies will be improved to 30- minute gaps between trains, and non-peak period frequencies will be increased to one hour. This will result in 42 trains per day, nearly doubling current service.

""SANDAG and NCTD are committed to improving the Los Angeles-San Diego- San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor, which supports goods movement, commuters and our nation's military,"" said SANDAG Chair and Poway Mayor Steve Vaus. ""Just last year, the SANDAG Board of Directors approved $58.8 million in funding for additional train sets to meet our goals of increased capacity, speed and safety."" The cars will be built at Bombardier's manufacturing site in Thunder Bay, Canada. Deliveries are scheduled to take place in the fall 2022. After testing and commissioning, the cars will begin to enter service that winter.",NO

When an Amtrak train went off its tracks in the forests outside of Northfield, Vermont, Oct. 5, state authorities needed pictures of the site to determine how best to respond and to document the damage for later investigations. So they decided to call in the drones, operated by the Spatial Analysis Lab at the University of Vermont. Within two hours, the university’s drone disaster response teams were flying their fixed-wing eBee unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, over the crash site.

Within an hour of arriving on the scene, the team’s drone shot 280 images of the derailment, with each high-resolution image linked to a precise location on the ground. By the end of the day, the drone team had processed the images into a seamless orthophotomosiac, a photographic “map” of the crash site that would come in handy for investigators.

As the Vermonter crash response shows, drones have in recent years become an easy and inexpensive way to collect invaluable images of accident and disaster sites: faster than a satellite and cheaper than a manned helicopter or airplane. Disaster response drones have been used in Nepal, Haiti, and Vanuatu and are increasingly finding their way into the toolkits of disaster response teams in the U.S.—including in Vermont, a surprisingly ideal testing ground for disaster drones.

Jarlath O’Neill-Dunne is the director of the Spatial Analysis Lab at the University of Vermont and served as mission commander during the response to the derailed train. A trained forester with military experience, O’Neill-Dunne first became interested in using drones for responding to and documenting disasters after Hurricane Irene swept through Vermont in 2011, destroying homes, roads, and bridges.

“It caused havoc for us,” says O’Neill-Dunne of the hurricane year. “We got a foot of rain in about an hour. … We had the ability to use satellites, but we found it wasn’t really that effective.” Clouds regularly covered relevant areas, and getting the right imagery on time to the right people proved to be a huge hassle. O’Neill-Dunne applied for a Department of Transportation grant, intending to study how drone imagery could help document destruction and get transportation going again after a natural disaster. Since, the lab has acquired two eBee drones from the French Sensefly company: black and yellow foam flying wings that weigh about 1.5 pounds and are equipped with sophisticated automatic flight-planning technology. As they’ve gained experience with flying their drones and using the data, the lab has developed a swift but formal protocol for deploying to the scene—with checklists and an established mission structure intended to keep the response organized and safe.

Unlike many other drone pioneers in the U.S., O’Neill-Dunne’s SAL lab has an easy relationship with state and federal regulators: The drone pilots work closely with state airspace authorities, and Vermont’s limited land area and small population have proved a good testing ground for drone disaster response tactics. The University of Vermont also holds a Section 333 exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing it to legally use the UAVs under controlled conditions out of the state.

Even before the derailment, the drones proved their utility for small-town disasters, after destructive rainstorms hit central Vermont on July 19. In the riverside town of Plainfield, the team used the eBee to carry out a rapid assessment of the damage to homes and roads and studied the aerial imagery to figure out how much wood and other debris was clogging local streams, potentially making bridges impassable.

In Barre, the team used the aerial imagery to document flooding destruction and to trace the spread of sediment in homes and on roads in exact detail—specific data that would make it easier for homeowners to get disaster relief assistance from FEMA. “Drone imagery didn’t help with the response—everyone knew whose house had flooded. But if you apply for disaster assistance, now you have survey-grade data,” says O’Neill-Dunne.

Will drones soon become a pedestrian part of disaster response, as expected as fire trucks and ambulances? While it’s quite possible, plenty of challenges still stand in the way of drone-disaster response spreading to the rest of the country. For one thing, there’s public concern over privacy and how camera-equipped drones might violate it. O’Neill-Dunne is sensitive to these worries but points out that the nadir (straight above) drone imagery he shoots isn’t much good for spying, considering that it’s hard to positively identify someone by looking at the top of their head. “It’s not a surveillance tool, it’s a mapping tool. We’re trying to use it in that realm, with the hope of alleviating the concerns of a lot of people,” he says.

Regulatory issues remain the biggest hurdle for disaster drones: The technology remains in a tricky legal gray area in the U.S., with final federal regulations set to come out sometime next year. That’s worrisome for drone disaster responders like O’Neill-Dunne. “If we had legislation banning drones flying over private property, especially in midmorning when people aren’t home and can’t give permission, we couldn’t do it,” he says. “We do need to consider privacy concerns, but is there a difference between someone shooting an image of your house from their car or a drone or a satellite?”

Ultimately, O’Neill-Dunne believes that the sheer usefulness of drone technology will overcome public trepidation, especially when it comes to small towns that lack the resources needed to send out helicopters or purchase pricy satellite information when disaster strikes. Instead of relying on bigger state or federal agencies, small American towns—already proud of their self-reliance—may soon be able to use drones to deal with both natural and man-made disasters.",NO

Metrolink lines were delayed on the Antelope Valley line for an undetermined amount of time as deputies investigated.

192,np_url,"The Peters Cartridge Company in Kings Mill, Ohio, was once an integral part of a local munitions production industry, but now the abandoned factory weeps lonely heavy metals into the soil.

Built in the 1860s, the large building complex was established to support the Peters Cartridge Company. The factory began by producing shot and cannonballs for the Union Army during the Civil War, and then continued to produce American munitions into the 1950s. Throughout all this time, the factory used the shot tower method to produce munitions, using their tower emblazoned with a giant ""P"". Workers would ascend steep stairs to the very top of the tower. Once there they would pour molten lead through a copper sieve. While falling through the length of the hollow tower, the lead would cool and form into perfectly round balls. These would land in a basin of water, or in the case of the Peters tower, a creek, to be cooled further. Once done they were musket bullets or shot.

The factory had its share of accidents. In 1890 several train cars loaded with gunpowder collided and exploded, killing twelve factory workers. There were a number of fire and machinery accidents as well, leaving employees maimed and physically disabled.

Before the factory finally closed, the site was repurposed to press vinyl for Columbia Records, but eventually, nothing was being made in the tall brick buildings. It remains mostly the same, minus a few buildings of the sprawling complex that have been repurposed. The rest is overgrown and decaying, inhabited only by squatters, cats, and allegedly, ghosts. It was even the set for a 2002 horror movie.

The old equipment and leftover materials led to copper, lead, and other contaminants penetrating into the ground, which made the ruins a Superfund clean-up site.

As the factory buildings are extremely dilapidated, local police supervise the Peters Cartridge Company closely. Urban exploration is not advised, as floorboards are rotten and elevator shafts are empty in the buildings.

Update February 2018: The current owners are trying to develop the site and are now awaiting final certification from the EPA that the site’s ground is no longer contaminated prior to further redevelopment.

Update June 2018: Approval has been granted and an architect selected to convert a portion of the facility into a craft brewery.

Update July 6, 2021: The location is now a restaurant/brewery business.",NO

The crash occurred at around 8 p.m. local time at Beaumont Highway and Van Hut Lane when the driver of the Chrysler 300 drove around the crossing arms that signaled the approaching train, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement, which said flashing red lights and a bell were activated at the crossing to indicate the train’s arrival.

The car was engulfed in flames on impact, and the driver and the passenger were ejected, police said. Both were pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

The mother of a 5-year-old boy, who was found dead in a suitcase nearly two years ago in Indiana, was arrested in Arcadia in connection with his murder, according to authorities.

Dejaune L. Anderson was arrested Thursday by the U.S. Marshals Service on allegations of murder, neglect of a dependent resulting in death and obstruction of justice, Indiana State Police Sgt. Carey Huls told The Times.

Authorities were tipped off by a “concerned citizen,” and Anderson was detained while attempting to board a train, Huls said. He declined to specify further how authorities were tipped off.

On April 16, 2022, a man hunting for mushrooms in a wooded, rural area of Washington County, Indiana, found the body of a 5-year-old boy in a brightly colored suitcase, officials said. The boy was identified six months later as Cairo Jordan, an Atlanta resident.

An arrest warrant was issued for Anderson in October 2022, but the boy’s mother had been on the run ever since.

Investigators from Sellersburg, Ind., were in Southern California over the weekend to try to speak to Anderson and to continue their investigation, according to Huls. Anderson has a court hearing Monday; the extradition process will depend on how she pleads. If she doesn’t fight the extradition, officials from Indiana could pick her up in the next week or two.

“If she fights extradition, then it’ll be at the mercy of California courts for it to play out,” Huls said. “A governor’s warrant would probably be requested and court system will have to work that out. It’ll be at least a month until that process will get started.”

Anderson is originally from the Atlanta area and is not a resident of Indiana, Huls said. She has no known connection to Southern California.

Anderson’s friend Dawn Elaine Coleman, 41, of Shreveport, La., was sentenced to 30 years in prison with five years suspended to probation in connection with Cairo’s death after reaching a deal with prosecutors in November.

Coleman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, aiding, neglect of a dependent resulting in death and obstruction of justice, according to authorities.

Coleman and Anderson had known each other for about a year and traveled together with Cairo; they had been staying in a residence in Louisville at the time of the boy’s death, according to police.

Coleman told police that she saw Anderson smothering Cairo by sitting on top of him when he was face-down on a bed, according to court records. Coleman said “it was already done” by the time she walked into the room and that Anderson asked her to help put Cairo inside a trash bag and then a suitcase. They drove Cairo’s body to Washington County and left him there in the suitcase, she said.

Both Coleman’s and Anderson’s fingerprints were found on the plastic bags that contained Cairo’s body inside the suitcase, investigators said.

According to a probable cause affidavit filed by the Indiana State Police for Anderson’s arrest, Anderson allegedly made references to exorcism and demonic possession regarding her 5-year-old son in Facebook posts in March 2022.

“Can’t wait to tell my story: I had to raise my frequency, heal myself and past lives, heal my ancestors, heal s— in the universe, heal Gaia to exorcism a very powerful demonic force from within my son,” she wrote, according to the affidavit.

Coleman posted similar messages on Facebook in April 2022, according to the affidavit:

“Just because the avatar is of what we call a child does not mean that it is actually a child there are beings that are here that are not supposed to be here that pick avatars to hide behind to play roles to steal energy and to ruin lives you better check to see if the children that you think are children actually have souls or if they’re not melevolent [sic] beings with a soul and in a child Avatar.”

The Gilbert family of Sabre Springs almost lost their only parent and oldest sibling in a devastating car crash on a rainy Interstate 405 on Thanksgiving Day.

On that day, the family's patriarch, Jason Gilbert, went to pick up his daughter Alexa Gilbert, 21, at Los Angeles International Airport. Alexa Gilbert was studying abroad in Italy and wanted to surprise her siblings for the holiday.

But they would never make it.

""We are so lucky they are both alive because the back seat was in the front,"" said Eliza.

Alexa Gilbert had a punctured heart, a collapsed lung, broke both collar bones, and nine ribs. She underwent emergency heart surgery.

Three weeks later and just in time for Christmas, Alexa Gilbert was released from the hospital. Her teenage siblings, Eliza and Aden, said it was an early Christmas gift.

""I think we are so grateful that the three of us are all together,"" said Eliza.

Their dad, a single father after the daughters' mother died when they were infants, has not yet been released from the Long Beach hospital. It will likely be months before he is ready to come home.

I never could imagine being without him. My dad is like my best friend,"" Eliza Gilbert said. ""I knew instantly I was going to be the one to step up and take care of the household.""

""I googled how to pay bills. What am I supposed to do about medical bills and the insurance claim that was mailed to us? I am just 18 and I am just like, OK this is what I have to do.""

She is even taking care of Alexa Gilbert as she recovers.

""She has done everything for me, even helping me bath,"" said Alexa. ""I am just so grateful for her, and for my brother's help too.""

Luckily, the Gilberts have had the support of community members in Sabre Springs. A friend started a meal train where each day a different person -- including some the Gilberts have never met -- drops off a meal for the family.

""I think it’s really beautiful to see so many people come together when like, we don’t know what we did to deserve so much love and support,"" Eliza Gilbert said.

A cousin gifted the family a Christmas tree, which they all decorated it together the night Alexa Gilbert came home.

""After (decorating the tree) the three of us sat on this floor, just sobbing because we didn’t think we were going to have a Christmas this year,"" Eliza Gilbert said.

""To have that much love and support was so unexpected and we were just like we made it through it she is alive, dad’s alive although they are still healing we are going to get through it.""

USA TODAY

At least 50 people were injured Thursday when a chartered casino bus overturned after apparently swerving on Interstate 210 east of Los Angeles.

The accident occurred about 10 a.m. PT on eastbound 210 in Irwindale, just past the interchange with the 605 Freeway. The crash left the bus — with the front windows knocked out — resting on its side down an embankment beside train tracks.

The Da Zhen Travel Agency bus was headed to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, near San Bernardino, said the charter company, based in in Monterey Park, Calif.



None of the injured was in critical condition, KTLA-TV said, citing the Los Angeles County Fire Department. KTLA reported 50 were injured; the Los Angeles Timessaid 55. Most suffered cuts and bruises.

A doctor told the Times that most of the patients he treated at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center were between 60 and 80 years old.

According to conversations on the California Highway Patrol radio, officers were seeking Chinese translators at the scene and at hospitals to help talk to passengers.

The Associated Press noted that the route is frequented by ""gamblers' special"" buses carrying tourists from the San Gabriel Valley to desert casinos and Las Vegas.

All lanes of 210 were shut down to allow emergency helicopters to land, creating a massive traffic jam winding back for several miles. The highway patrol opened the westbound lanes after about an hour, and some eastbound lanes were reopened just after 2 p.m.

Authorities did not immediately announce what caused the accident, saying the investigation was continuing.

Some witnesses said the bus was moving toward the carpool lane when the driver swerved and braked hard to avoid another vehicle, KABC-TV reported. A truck driver traveling behind the bus told the Times it was traveling about 70 mph before the accident.

Early reports said the bus had collided with a big rig, but one witness told KABC the bus clipped a car as it changed lanes.",NO

616,np_url,"Melissa Seidemann, second from left, and other water polo players listen to coach Adam Krikorian’s instructions during practice at Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos.

There were deaths, near deaths and gruesome injuries.

There was a mass shooting in Las Vegas, a nightclub collapse in South Korea and a terrorist bombing at a train station in Belgium. And all that happened before COVID-19 put everyone’s life on hold for a year.

The last five years have been a series of tragedies and triumphs for the women on the U.S. water polo team, experiences coach Adam Krikorian insists have prepared them for winning an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic title in Tokyo — a quest that starts Saturday when the U.S. plays Japan.

“It feels like this is the way it was supposed to happen,” he said. “Every time any one of us deal with some adversity and challenges, as painful or as sad as it can be, we do look at it as an opportunity to grow and to be better.

“Embracing that, we’ve accepted it as part of our journey and, in some ways, of a greater purpose.”

If that makes it a team of destiny, it’s one Krikorian and his players have paid for with enough blood, sweat and especially tears to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

It started shortly after the team arrived in Rio de Janeiro for the last Olympics when Krikorian got a text from home informing him that his brother Blake had died of a heart attack at 48. The coach left the team and booked a 12-hour flight to San Francisco. He briefly considered staying there but returned to Brazil where, hours before the first game, he learned the mother of defender Melissa Seidemann had suffered a stroke and was in a Rio hospital.

The team rolled the competition unbeaten, outscoring its six opponents 73-32; after the final both Seidemann and Krikorian broke down on the pool deck. When the players stepped off the medal podium, they filed over to their still-grieving coach and, one by one, draped 13 gold medals around his neck.

“You do feel like there’s a greater power that is testing your resolve, as an individual and as a team,” Krikorian said. “We’re trying to teach you a lesson, you know, about where this fits into the puzzle.”

That puzzle became more complicated a year later when a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas, killing 59 and wounding more than 400. Seidemann and teammates Maddie Musselman and Alys Williams attended the festival, although only Williams was still there when the shooting started.

Convinced there were multiple shooters, Williams and her boyfriend ignored the warnings of police and starting running. Someone screamed that they had been hit, but Williams didn’t look back.

“I knew what was happening,” she said. “I wasn’t curious.”

Seidemann, stunned, watched it on TV from a few blocks away. Nearly seven hours later, when it was safe to go downtown, she picked her teammate up, canceled her flight home and drove Williams to Huntington Beach instead.

A year earlier, traveling through Belgium to a tournament in the Netherlands, Williams showed up late for her train and missed a connection. Had she been on the train, she would have been in the Maalbeek metro station in Brussels when a suicide bomber set off explosives, killing 20 and injuring more than 100.

After the Las Vegas shooting, a friend of Williams’ mother bought her a lucky horseshoe. “She was like ‘hang this in your house. You need this,’” Williams said with a smile.

Then, turning serious again, she added: “I have a belief that everything happens for a reason. I don’t get to know why. I obsessed over why after the shooting for so long until I realized it’s not my place to know why. It’s my place to keep moving forward.”

Williams had a third brush with death in July 2019 at a Seoul nightclub. The U.S. had won the FINA World Championships that day, and Williams and a couple of exhausted teammates decided to leave the victory celebration early and return to their rooms in the athletes’ village.

Forty-five minutes later a second-floor balcony collapsed, killing two and injuring 17.

Kaleigh Gilchrist, who had played more than 20 minutes in the gold-medal game, was among those injured, sustaining cuts to her left leg that were so deep a team trainer on the scene used a belt to make a tourniquet. Doctors, who needed more than 100 stitches to close the wounds, told her if the wounds had been just millimeters deeper, she would have lost the use of her left foot.

Her father, Sandy, had swum for Canada in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo and competing in the Games in the same city for the U.S. had long been a dream for Gilchrist. Now she faced months of painful rehab if she had any hope of turning that dream into a reality.

Kobe Bryant, a Newport Beach neighbor who knew a little something about rehab, became a mentor in what Gilchrist’s trainer dubbed the Mamba Mission. Then Bryant was gone, killed in a helicopter crash. Not long before that Gilchrist had lost an earlier mentor when Bill Barnett, her coach at Newport Harbor High, died of leukemia.

Suddenly physical therapy wasn’t the only kind of help Gilchrist needed.

“I had horse blinders on. Like ‘I’ve got to get better physically. Twelve hours a day,’” she said. “And then little things popped up here and there with some panics and claustrophobia. I realized I needed help.”

Gilchrist began meeting with three different therapists in addition to the physical rehab and daily training sessions. It was exhausting, physically and emotionally, and without the COVID delay, Krikorian isn’t sure she would have made the team for Tokyo.

“There’s no question that extra year helped her,” he said. “Because of her experiences and because of this year off, it’s given her some time to reevaluate, reassess and better herself. Naturally that reflects itself in the water. But that is secondary, to be honest.”

Now the focus turns to the pursuit of a third straight gold medal, something that’s never been accomplished in the women’s tournament, which this year has grown by two to include 10 teams.

Krikorian’s team is the most decorated in the history of the women’s game, having won every major international title since 2013. But while the team includes eight players from the championship squad in Rio de Janeiro, the trial and tribulations of the last five years make the Tokyo team unique.

“This is a special group,” goalie Ashleigh Johnson said. “We’ve gone through a lot of adversity together. And we’ve gotten through it together. ‘Together’ is the key word because nothing that any one of us has experienced [have] they experienced alone.”

Gilchrist agreed.

“I would be very interested to see if any other team has gone through as much as we’ve gone through,” she said. “The outside adversity this group has overcome is insane. Maybe one day [they’ll] write a book about it.”

Amazingly the train crash at the New Mexico/Arizona was captured on video right when it happened

Usually when this sort of event happens, you see video of the aftermath & the clean up of the wreckage. But not this time; a car's dashboard camera managed to capture video right when the train left the tracks AND the insuring explosion that followed. You can even see just HOW CLOSE that first fireball got to the camera car, and I-40 itself.

The person who uploaded this footage, Harry Collins Photography, stated that this was his mother & father in law who caught this amazing derailment on camera.

That wasn't the only video of the train derailment either; there was another one from a truck driver that captured the massive explosive after the train crashed. It wasn't as close as the first one but after seeing how big that fireball is... thank god they WEREN'T closer to the flames!

Thankfully no one was killed. In fact, no one was INJURED in the crash, which is amazing considering the size of the fireballs that came from the crash itself.

This wasn't the first time a train would derail in either New Mexico or Arizona; but thankfully this is NOT a case that resulted in a loss of life.

A car that hit clubgoers outside a show at the SXSW festival has left at least two dead and five critically injured, according to Austin police.

The incident happened during the music portion of the multidisciplinary confab in Austin, Texas. The film portion, which overlaps with the music section, continues through Friday, with some attendees moving between events at the two gatherings.

According to a story on our sister blog Nation Now, at about 1 a.m. CDT Thursday morning a car described as “a grey sedan with a cracked windshield” plowed through a crowd waiting outside a South by Southwest show at the city’s Mohawk venue near the corner of Red River and 10th streets. The car left a trail of wounded clubgoers in the middle of the busy intersection and the crash was visible to blocks of concertgoers.

Police later confirmed two dead and five critically wounded, with a total of 23 taken to a hospital for treatment. Neither the victims nor the driver have as yet been identified.

Festival-goers were said to be outside Mohawk for the show of Tyler the Creator, a rapper and record producer who also has directed music videos and has appeared in other screen entertainment, including episodes of “Punk’d” and “The Mindy Project.”

The SXSW incident also underscored the danger of large crowds at festivals of all sorts. As at the SXSW music gathering, the Sundance and Cannes Film Festivals routinely see audiences packed outside venues with security experts often warning that such a large concentration of people can pose safety risks.

The pair star in the latest film by John Wick director David Leitch. It follows five assassins caught in interconnected missions aboard a speeding Japanese bullet train.

While promoting the film at Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland, Taylor-Johnson was asked about working with the iconic actor.

“He is in a new chapter of his life, I think,” Taylor-Johnson told journalists, per Variety, at the festival, describing Pitt as a “humble and gracious human being”.

The Kick-Ass star continued: “He just wants to bring light and joy into the world and be around people who are there to have a good time.

“You work with many actors and after a while you start making notes: ‘I am definitely not working with this person ever again.’ Brad has this list too: the ‘good’ list and the ‘s***’ list.”

During Bullet Train’s Los Angeles premiere on Monday (1 August), Taylor-Johnson detailed a gruesome injury he picked up on the set of the new action film.

“We were in a fight sequence and I get drop-kicked across the room,” the actor explained.

“The one sharp bit of the corner where there wasn’t any padding took a chunk out of my hand. And I literally went wham, passed out,” he said.

Alongside Pitt and Taylor-Johnson, Bullet Train features an ensemble cast which includes Sandra Bullock, Joey King, Brian Tyree Henry, Zazie Beetz, Michael Shannon, Andrew Koji and the music artist Bad Bunny.

The car flipped over during the collision, which took place at around 6am on May 29 and caused major damage to the bridge over the railway.

The Kings Norton branch of West Midlands Fire and Rescue said a train was affected – although nobody was injured.

Pictures taken at the scene show the car was flipped onto its roof when West Midlands Fire and Rescue crews from Kings Norton arrived.

Details have been breaking throughout the day, so this is all we know so far:

A white Nissan Juke collided with the bridge in Vicarage Road.

Fire crews were called out at 6.10am and found the collision had caused bricks to fall onto the track below.

The car had flipped onto its roof and the bridge was significantly damaged.

A 26-year-old man and 27-year-old man were taken to hospital with serious injuries and remain in a stable condition.

There was nobody on the train but the driver, who was shaken up but uninjured.

They were , but everything appears to be running smoothly now.

Network Rail said at the time engineers were assessing the bridge this morning and warned passengers to expect diversions and delays of 20 minutes until around 2pm.

The train lines affected included the busy Cross City line between Redditch and Lichfield and the Cross Country line between Nottingham and Cardiff Central.

What did police have to say?

West Midlands Police issue this statement: “Investigations are on-going and the road has been partially opened to traffic while work continues to secure the damaged bridge.”

Any witnesses with information are urged to call the investigation team on 101 quoting log number 566 of May 29, 2017.",NO

For some, that future can’t arrive soon enough. As a locomotive engineer for Amtrak, Blake Phillips-Rios has a unique perspective of the challenges facing the industry—and a lot of ideas for how to get the country’s trains moving again.

When he’s not working on the railroad, Phillips-Rios is in graduate school at Cal State University where he’s getting his MBA, and co-owner of Cabrón Cochino, a clothing line for men of color. You can follow him at @elcabroncochino to peek in on his journeys on and off the rails. Here’s what it’s like to drive a train for work.

I started at Amtrak in 2013 as an assistant conductor—the one with the hat that scans your tickets and makes announcements. I got promoted to locomotive engineer in 2015, and now, I drive the train.

Since I’m still fairly new, I’m part of what’s called the “extra board.” That means that I’m on-call 24 hours a day except on Tuesdays from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. (My 24-hour “relief day” can also change each month.) As an extra board engineer, I work when those who have regularly scheduled jobs take vacations, mark off sick, or when there are service disruptions or special trains. I don’t have a specific route but can be called for the Pacific Surfliner—the train between San Luis Obispo, LA, and San Diego—and on the Southwest Chief, the train to Chicago. We go as far as Kingman, Arizona, and then work the next train back to Los Angeles the following day.

I live in South LA in Leimert Park with my husband, Jerry, and I am not what we railroaders commonly refer to as a “foamer.” Foamer is a pejorative term for a railfan—because they foam every time a train goes by! However, in my spare time, I’m quite interested in urban planning and development, public transportation, housing, and architecture.

Today’s a day off! I don’t leave the house all day because I’m working on a big grad school paper. In the evening I drive to go visit my business partner in Echo Park for a meeting.

On Friday, I start work at 6 a.m. I drive to the southern tip of the Arts District to our 8th Street train yard which is underneath the 10 freeway next to the LA River. By 5:15 a.m. I’m on my way to work.

While we picked our neighborhood for its history and culture, one of my requirements was proximity to public transportation. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for me to take the train or bus to or from the train yard. There is a bus route from my house to Union Station, but not every bus goes there, the schedule is not regular, and it takes 59 minutes—as opposed to the 15 to 30 minutes even with traffic in the car.

I cannot wait until the Crenshaw Line opens next year! It’s my dream to not drive to work every day. I live three blocks from the Leimert Park station and have been following the line’s development closely. The new Metro line is all that my neighbors can talk about, as well.

With both the huge Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Mall redevelopment and the arrival of the train on the horizon, our neighbors are quite nervous about evictions, rent increases, and the “G” word (gentrification). I sincerely hope that Leimert Park loses neither the character with which we fell in love, nor its sense of community. Where else in LA do people say hello to random strangers walking down the street? I really love my neighborhood.

On the drive back home I go down Martin Luther King Boulevard. Due to the width, I regularly propose to our Councilmember Herb Wesson’s office that protected bike lanes would be perfect for King Blvd. It would dovetail fantastically with the MyFigueroa project’s semi-protected bike lanes that end at Figueroa and the new Crenshaw Line at the other end of MLK at Crenshaw Boulevard.

The architecture of the historic apartment buildings along MLK would be amazing to ride past. More importantly, people in our part of town actually use bikes as their main mode of transportation. MLK is practically a freeway at certain times of the day and cyclists take their lives into their own hands just getting to and from work or the grocery store. Someone from Herb Wesson’s office told me, while laughing, that if MLK is so dangerous, then why would we put bike lanes there? I didn’t even have the energy to explain how stupid that was.

On the way home, I love driving past our new soccer stadium—so cool!

Today, I operate the train all the way up the coast to San Luis Obispo, a small college town on the Central Coast. San Luis Obispo is the northernmost terminal for the Pacific Surfliners. The trip up the coast is absolutely beautiful. We follow the 101 freeway until north of Santa Barbara and then snake through an Air Force base and untouched, pristine California coastline. We are traveling on a system that was built well over 100 years ago.

While I am not talking negatively about Amtrak specifically—mostly because it’s my main source of income!—we can all agree that public transportation in Southern California is seriously lacking. If you’ve ever taken Amtrak, chances are you’ve experienced some fairly large delays. IT’S NOT OUR FAULT! The majority of the railroad throughout Southern California—and particularly in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo counties—has only one track. That means that if one train is late by 20 minutes leaving San Luis Obispo at 7 a.m., it can equal an hour and a half delay in San Diego at 6 p.m. because trains are constantly stopping to wait for other passing trains. “Late trains only get later” is a phrase we say a lot.

I am a staunch proponent of the as-yet-unbuilt, unfunded—and now semi-unsupported?—high-speed rail system from San Francisco to Los Angeles. But the building of a second main track throughout the entire system, from San Luis Obispo to San Diego, would increase service and capacity dramatically. As the second-busiest passenger rail corridor in the nation, it is embarrassing to come to a complete stop multiple times per trip. It’s directly related to the decades of lack of investment in our rail infrastructure.

All the while, the state and local governments continuously work to expand and improve our highway system. I was shocked the first time I took a van from LA to San Luis Obispo. On the train, it takes five-and-a-half hours, but we made the drive with little traffic in about three hours. How can we logically expect the general public to not drive when we’ve made it so convenient?

They don’t call me for work today, so I decide to do one of my favorite things in the world. I drive to a dance class at the Heartbeat House in Atwater Village. After that, I take the Gold Line to visit my friend for dinner in Monrovia.

Unfortunately, it’s not that difficult to come up with reasons why even I don’t use public transportation that often. This trip to Monrovia sums it up perfectly. On this day, Metro is doing track work in Highland Park and South Pasadena. Therefore, we have to “single-track.” This is railroad-speak for one track being out of service, so trains in both directions have to use the same one. Remember our problems with delays on the coast?

Because of the delays, each stop is packed with riders, and for some reason, Metro didn’t anticipate completely full trains. So, we ride like sardines in a trainset that has only two cars. (They do, however, have other three-car trainsets.) The total trip takes an hour and 15 minutes. I also arrive at the Monrovia train station 40 minutes later than the trip planner said I would. By car, on a Sunday, with little traffic from Atwater, it would have taken me 25 minutes, max. This is why most people drive, plain and simple.

Today I start work at 4:45 p.m. I drive the train bound for Chicago but we only go as far as Kingman, Arizona.

Right after I leave for work, my husband sends a picture to me. Yes, that car is on its side. Frankly, neither of us are surprised, and as a community, we’ve come to expect it. This is at least the sixth major crash at the intersection in front of our house. One time, a car crashed directly INTO OUR BUILDING. Another time, a car hit the light pole on the corner and the light pole fell INTO OUR KITCHEN. The streetlight completely destroyed the window and part of the building.

Twice a car has taken out the row of cars right in front of our apartment building. One time, a car jumped the curb across the street and crashed into one of the huge pine trees, which saved some kids who were playing in the path of the out-of-control driver. And yet again, another car crashed into the building across the street from us—right into their apartment. In the background of the photo, you can actually see the gap in the fence where the last big accident happened. The wall on that building downstairs is completely new. The car totaled all four cars in those parking spaces that late night.

Luckily, in all the accidents we’ve witnessed, no one has died, but many, many cars have been totaled. We also live one block away from a middle school, and this intersection is a way home for kids walking. I have called my councilmember’s office every time something major happens and more or less get the total runaround by his deputy.

We arrive in Kingman at 2 a.m., and I spend all day in my hotel room sleeping and hiding from the cold. It looks beautiful, but it’s about 35 degrees outside.

I think that every party involved in rail transportation has the intention to provide quality service to the general public—and that’s not just lip service. However, because of the governmental or agency red tape, lack of money, lack of political will, and the good old fashioned NIMBYism of neighborhoods near our rail corridor—ones that the railroad preceded sometimes by 100 years—to move forward with even the simplest projects draws fierce opposition. You can see why a double-tracking project in the San Fernando Valley from Van Nuys to Chatsworth might fail.

Consider that LOSSAN (Los Angeles/San Diego/San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor), the agency that’s in charge of Amtrak’s coastal Pacific Surfliners, is made up of six county governments: San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. And then, these agencies have to interact with four separate railroad agencies: the Union Pacific, the BNSF, Metrolink [LA’s regional rail], and North County Transit District [San Diego’s regional rail].

Short of a complete shift in the mindset of those neighborhoods, here are a few ideas that I think would completely change our rail experience.
• The state should double track the entirety of our territory.
• The state should buy all or as much of the railroad from the freight companies that they are willing to part with.
• California should remove all interaction with pedestrians and trains. It will be amazingly costly, but grade separation is key to speeding up the railroad, and saving lives. People in SoCal live and play really, really close to some highly trafficked 90 mph railroad tracks.
• The state should work to straighten the tracks and bring the average track speed everywhere to at least 50 mph. We snake through Orange County at 35 and 40 mph at certain points; the same goes for San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.
• Something that is already in the works: hourly service everywhere we go. I used to live in France and never thought about a schedule when taking the train. I just showed up to the train station. It’s so easy to get stranded for hours in SoCal currently.
• LOSSAN (or some similar state-level agency) should take over the governance of all transportation for our region, from regional to local. In Paris, the subways and regional rail (for the most part) are run by the same agency. We should strive for uniformity across our region. This would cut red tape, confusion, delays, and duplication of service. From San Luis Obispo to San Diego, I should be able to use the same agency’s ticket everywhere—buses, trains, light rail, subway, etc. For example, Metrolink single-ride tickets aren’t accepted on Amtrak. If we belonged to the same company or agency, it wouldn’t matter because the money was going to the same place.
• Also, all transportation workers in Southern California should become State of California employees—not contractors working for 50 different agencies and small transportation companies. Each company has different policies, and what is okay with one carrier sometimes will get you kicked off another one. It can be really confusing.

After driving all night, I get back from Kingman at 8:30 a.m. I drive home in rush-hour traffic heading back to South LA and Leimert Park. I’m so tired!

Writing this transit diary has allowed me to express my personal thoughts and opinions about how to improve our transportation system in Southern California. My answer is usually, “JUST BUILD IT, ALREADY!” But this is something that I spend a lot of time contemplating every day. While I can read about Metro’s amazing expansion, the train service that Amtrak and the state of California plan to add, the electrification of Metrolink, or even our high-speed rail system of the future (supposedly), all which will happen in the semi-distant future, the truth is nothing will really change until we all take steps today to change how we move around our region.

At the end of 2018, I wrote a little essay about what I was going to do to change my own transportation habits in 2019. I mean, if I can’t figure out how to make taking public transportation work for my life, and I am public transportation, how can I expect someone to do anything differently—with kids, poor transit connections in their neighborhood, or just a lack of knowledge about how our system works?

For now, until my transportation options change dramatically, I’ll have to be okay with being a pedestrian only “from time to time”—and continue to support those in power that promote my values.",NO

127,rd_html,"The man killed when Josh Turner's crew tour bus crashed in California on Wednesday night (Sept. 18) has been identified. David Turner, a longtime member of Turner's sound crew, was 64 years old.

According to KSBY-TV, officials identified David Turner -- no relation to Josh Turner -- as the deceased early Thursday (Sept. 19) morning. Tupelo, Miss., newspaper the Daily Journal reports that David Turner, a native of Bruce, Miss., worked as part of Josh Turner's sound, lighting and stage crew; according to his LinkedIn page, he began working with the singer in early 2006.

Jerry Slone, a friend of David Turner and some of Josh Turner's other crew members, tells WKRN-TV, that David Turner (""DT"" to his friends) had worked in the music business for more than 40 years, with artists including Tammy Wynette, Conway Twitty and Patty Loveless. He was a husband, father and grandfather, and loved coffee, cigars and talking politics. Slone describes him as a ""sweet guy"" with a ""gentle soul [and a] big heart.""

David Turner and seven other people -- one bus driver and six additional members of Josh Turner's road crew -- were on a tour bus headed from Paso Robles, Calif., to Washington State when the bus crashed in Shandon, Calif., around 11:45PM local time. The tour bus, which was being driven by 39-year-old Bradley Dratnol, drove off the road and through 20 yards of vegetation, then went down an 80-foot cliff, hitting the sand of a dry riverbed below. Josh Turner and his band were on another bus that was part of the same caravan.

The front end of the bus that crashed sustained major damage, and a trailer that was being towed by the bus flipped on top of the bus. First responders needed to use the jaws of life to extricate one victim, and set up a rope system to rescue the passengers from the riverbed.

Of the eight people on the bus, two were ejected from the vehicle in the crash. Five people sustained moderate injuries, and two others suffered major injuries; six of the victims were taken to local hospitals, while Dratnol, the driver, sustained serious leg injuries and was airlifted to a hospital in Fresno, Calif.

An eyewitness to the crash reports that the tour bus was traveling approximately 60-65 miles per hour at the time of the accident, in an area in which the speed limit is 55 miles per hour. Someone on a bus following the bus that crashed says they did not see brake lights go on when the bus that crashed left the road. California Highway Patrol officials are working to determine what caused the crash, but have ruled out drugs or alcohol as a cause; they are also exploring the possibility of mechanical issues, and will be impounding the vehicle. Charges will likely be filed because of the death and injuries.

Josh Turner was scheduled to perform in Yakima, Wash., on Friday (Sept. 20). However, according to a representative for the singer, all remaining September shows will be rescheduled for a later date.",NO
866,rd_html,"Twenty years ago, on Jan. 17, 1994, at 4:31 a.m., the Northridge earthquake struck Southern California — the 6.7-magnitude quake killed 60 people and left more than 80,000 structures damaged or destroyed. Here is a look back at your memories.

The quake woke me from a sound sleep in the Palms apartment I shared with three UCLA classmates. The first impression I remember forming was that the motion was up and down, not the shimmy of all previous quakes. Crossing to the doorway, I think my feet left the ground more than once. I barely dodged the overturning of my chest of drawers. The sound, as always, was as shocking as any motion. Everyone wants to know what it's like for the earth to move under your feet but the scary part is how a whole city sounds as it shakes around you. While my roommates and I gathered in our respective doorways I smelt a queasy mixture of all the cologne bottles that had been on my dresser and that now were broken and puddling on the floor.

I had to be to work at 6AM at the Omni Hotel Downtown (back then it was the Intercontinental) Coming from Huntington Beach I decided to take the new 105 carpool interchange to get up high and see what was going on. (dumb move after I heard what happened at the 5/14 interchange) No electricity as far as the eye could see and fires in the distance. When I got downtown the brick facade of the Biltmore Hotel was a pile of bricks 3' high on the sidewalk in front of the hotel. At the Intercontinenetal all the out of town guests were in the lobby in bathrobes trying to arrange rides to the airport GET ME OUT OF LA!

I was 9 years old, living in Malibu. I had just gotten up to go to the bathroom and was back in bed, still awake. The earthquake started and I knew exactly what it was, but I was thinking ""Wow, this is really long"". My sister told me to stop shaking her bed.

We still have a book that came out later that year, ""4:31"", that has tons of photos and comentary about the quake. I remember a woman who lost her husband, Phil Sook Lee (?), and one of her sons, who was only about 13, and how the book told how she was screaming for 'her baby'. That really stuck with me.

Also, I remember the photos of the accident where the police officer flew off the end of the freeway where it collapsed. To this day it makes me nervous when I'm going over a bridge and I momentarily cannot see the freeway continue on the other side.

I was nine years old when the earthquake hit, and I lived with my family in Sylmar. I would have slept through the thing if I hadn't had a dream about my mother screaming, only to wake up and find that it wasn't a dream. My parents, two older brothers, and myself couldn't linger to survey the damage and search for the family cat for too long; we soon discovered that there was a gas leak and that we needed to vacate the premises immediately. When we returned later in the day, we found that our home had been shifted completely off its foundation and we had to move until it could be fixed. We were fortunate enough that family friends and Grandma were willing to open their homes to us during that time... It completely changed all of our lives.

After a week of suffering from a nasty cold and getting very little rest, I was roughly shaken out of a deep, restful sleep. I recall holding onto my bed to keep from being shaken off. It was pitch black in my Sylmar condo and I was thinking, ""This is the Big One, I'm going to die."" I held on forever as I listened to the rumbling and things falling around me. Finally, it stopped, I got out of bed, managed to find something to put on and made my way to the front door, slipping and sliding on the way. I heard water rushing as the water heaters from the other units had broken away as the aftershocks kept coming, freezing me on the spot. My husband and I went outside where we thought it was safer. I looked up at the sky and saw more stars than I ever seen anywhere. So gorgeous and it calmed me for a little while. We waited until the sun came up before going in to assess the damage. It was a mess, but no serious damage, We were very lucky, but that fear is still with me and always will be.

I was sleeping poorly, having to wake shortly to go to the San Diego airport for a flight back to Alaska, when I was jolterd out of bed. I heard my grandmother screaming and running out the back door of the house in Ocean Beach. All I could think was that the power lines over the steps could fall on her. By the time I got to the back door, the shaking stopped. Lindberg Field was on edge, and people were glued to the TV's at the gates and snack bars. My flight left on time, and looking down on LA was surreal. No cars on the freeways, no activities at the airports, and smoke rising from several spots south and north of the Hollywood Hills into the Valley. All I could do was wonder if my friends down there were OK. Months later I visited the area and remember piles of fireplace bricks at the curbs of the big homes of the Flats of Beverly Hills. I'll never forget!

I went to Winchell's Donuts on Laurel Canyon and Ventura - they charged $35.00 for a donut and a cup of coffee.

I actually woke up a few minutes before the quake hit. I was laying in bed staring at the clock waiting for the sun to rise. I was so excited because I had my 5th birthday party scheduled for that afternoon. It was a Power Rangers birthday party and I couldn't think about anything else. Just as my digital clock turned 4:31 the shaking started. I was so terrified. I looked around my room and saw all my books falling along with my giant blue bookcase. Downstairs I could hear our cabinets open and all of my mother's Deruta ceramics crashing on the tile below. I stayed in my bed, frozen and petrified.

I heard my parents running down the hall towards my room. On their way down the hall, my mother had tried to hurdle a giant bookcase and had cut her leg pretty badly. When they got to my room we all went down the back staircase and into my kitchen. The red tile was smothered by broken ceramics and glassware, it was something I'll never forget. We went on our back patio and spent some time on the chaise lounge chairs and waited for the sun to rise. Our neighbor, who has just undergone some kind of operation, was screaming for help in her house. She was pent up in a 1920's bungalow next door on Adelaide Avenue in Santa Monica. The front of her house was brick and had collapsed. We were worried about her but couldn't get in the house to help. Just then, as the sun was rising, I smelled gas. There was a horrible stench rising out of our backyard and it turned out that our main gas line had broken. Somehow my dad got to our garage, retrieved a wrench, and walked to the back of the property and turned the gas line off. Later that day, we went around the front of our house and saw that the brick chimney had collapsed and our house would need extensive renovations. It was a day I'll never forget. Thanks for letting me share my story LA Times! Go Dodgers!

I was in college at USC and I remember being woken up by violent shaking and my tv flying off the shelf and landing on top of me. The dorms evacuated outside and I recall crawling in the dark over all of my belongings that were now on the floor.

It was also a memorable event because I was in USC Architecture School. After the quake the school loaded the Arch majors onto buses and we toured the damage for our Structures course. It was an interesting research trip but it was also incredibly sad. We saw homes destroyed, cars cut in half in their garages, basically total devastation. One building in particular I remember because the whole facade of the building had slipped off on the road fully intact as if it was a slice of cheese.

The Quake changed how I looked at structures in Los Angeles and definitely gave me a better respect for the forces of nature.

My family and I were living in Anaheim Hills. When the quake hit the house shook violently. Plenty of broken glass. We listened to the radio and heard that the Valley was the epicenter. My mother was a life long resident of Notrthridge so I knew she would need help. About 6:30 I drove my truck in loaded with tools, water, food etc. I was surprised that I saw little to no damage on the 210 and 5. When I got to Burbank I began to see smoke all over the Valley. I got off the 5 at Osborne and worked my way across the Valley. There was damage everywhere. Lots of masonary walls had collapsed and many homes had jumped off the foundation. The streets began to show large cracks and you had to go slow. I finally arrived to Sherwood Forest where my mom lived. While the outside didn't look terrible except for the collapsed chimmeney, the inside was a total mess. The furniture had jumped all over the house. The kitchen was totally destroyed and all my mother's fine china destroyed Nogas leak as my mother had turned it off. She told me how she and the neighbors had stayed outside after the first hit and never went back in. Obviously no power etc. I worked 14 straight hours trying to straighten up a few rooms so she could still stay. She didn't want to go for fear of looters. I gave her a gun. We felt big after shocks all day but not big enough to make me want to get out It took several weekends to clean the place up before I found a contractor to help People started tearing their houses down to rebuild all over the neighborhood.

I was in Northridge staying at my moms apartment. I was 8 years old at the time. I remember waking up to the shaking and quickly grabbing my shoes and making it to the living room. The living room floor was soaking wet due to a broken salt water fish tank and the pool just outside the door that had splashed so much water that it came into the apartment. I tried throwing the fish into the pool thinking I was saving them (obviously I know now that wouldn't work lol). After we all got out of the apartment and went to a parking lot next door that had a Denny's in it. My step dad ran back to the apartments to help people get out since there was a gas leak. After the sun came up the people at Denny's set up a huge buffet for all of the people in the parking lot to eat. We also got to go around and look at all the damage of the apartment building. The back apartments had collapsed on top of the cars parked under them (my moms car was one of them). I had to go back to my dad's house that day in Sylmar and once I got there I still refused to go inside. I was scared to death to be anywhere enclosed for about a week.

We'd just moved to Los Angeles from New York city less than a week before the quake. That week was filled with a lot of activty and excitement - getting cars, finding an apartment and starting new jobs. As we settled in for our second night in our apartment near Pico in anticipation of what was going to be another busy day ahead, we planned on being woken up early in the morning by our furntiture movers who were heading west with our bed, couch and all manner of stuff for our new life in Californa. However, another kind of wake-up call came at 4:31, when the shaklng began. We didn't have far to fall as we were sleeping on the floor, and the sheer ferociousness of the quake combined with tour half-awakedness made it all see like a horrible, 3-D movie-influenced nightmare, but it was all too real. Though we didn't have furniture we did possess a flashlight, which we used to guide us to the living room after the second set of tectonic waves rolled through the empty apartment. As we huddled in the living room I said to my wife, and not joking, ""is this what they mean by an earthquake in L.A.?"" Well,we found out soon enough that this was not a typical earthquake at all; it was one that gave a potential preview of the big one. As the tragic loss of life and the city-wide devastation became evident we realized the enormity of the disaster and watched in horror at the images on televison and through our car widshield. As we drove past rows and rows of soon to be condemned buildings along Wilshire in Santa Monica I thought, how canever they fix all oft his? But they did and quickly. Someone arriving in L.A. today, like we did twenty years ago, would never see evidence of that event and lets hope they never do.

I have a lot more to tell, but I'll give you the short version. I owned a shipping and packing store on the corner of Devonshire and Woodley ( which is about 500 yards from the epicenter at Balboa and Devonshire ). I also operated a U-haul dealership out of my little store with truck rentals and trailers and moving boxes. All of these items became critical to the survivors who managed to get out of the Northridge Meadows apartments, and others who had their buildings and homes ""red tagged"". They were desperate to get their belongings out of the rubble with only minutes left before their buildings were sealed off and no admittance was premitted. My little store called ""Here-To-There"", was all but destroyed in the strip mall where I was located. I managed to find truck keys and some boxes from inside my store, inbetween aftershocks, and get what I could out to the parking lot. From there I helped as many people as I could by writing down their names and letting them use truck

I was supposed to go to a job interview later that day; I was living in Glendale with two roommates on the top floor of a two-story apartment complex. Immediately after the shaking startled me out of a deep sleep, I ran to the doorway (I had visions of the wall behind my bed falling away, and my bed falling with it!). We lost power until 11:30 that morning, and only then did the extent of the devastation become apparent as we watched TV for the rest of the day and into the evening. The phone lines soon became overloaded, and were out of service for several hours. I still have my ""I Survived The Northridge Earthquake"" T-shirt that I bought from a street vendor a few days later; you have to love those entrepreneurs! The irony is that I soon moved out to the Valley, and I've lived here ever since - waiting for the next one?!

As a single working parent in a one-story home, I yelled to my 7 and 4 year old girls to stay in bed: I would come and get them when the shaking stopped. I leaned over and grabbed 2 shoes out of the closet to head down the hallway. I had over 38 pictures on those walls, and the crashing, shattering glass was making a great deal of noise. The house felt like it was picked up, twisted violently from side to side about 4 times, and then dropped. The noise was horriffic, and it was pitch black as all my windows were shuttered. I felt my way down the hall, grabbed the 4 yr. old onto my back, and headed to the 7 yr old's bedroom. SHE WASN'T THERE!!!! She must have passed me in the hall because when I yelled 'where are you', she replied 'in your bed'. We huddled through the aftershakes until it got light. A dresser had fallen across a back doorway, so we had to climb over all the glass in the hallway to get out. Most of the damage was in the kitchen. My piano, large entertainment center, and refrigeratior moved 4 feet out from the walls. Dishes, pickles, syrup and food were spread all over the floor. Several windows were cracked, but, and here's the lucky part: I had just had a new rock roof put on that previous Friday--so my house survived intact! However, all the rocks were on the ground! What a morning--and that's the 3rd major quake I've been in (Tehachipi, Sylmar, Northridge) The reading on the richter scale for my area (Devonshire and Balboa, where the Kaiser bldg collapsed) was at 8.2!!!!

It was so LOUD. It sounded like a train roaring through the apartment building. I lived in San Diego at the time (I moved to L.A. later that year) but was visiting a good friend who lived in the Pico/Robertson area. I think every dish in her cabinet hit the kitchen floor, and the television worked its way out of the wall unit and gouged a chunk out of the hardwood floor. After spending the remaining night hours huddled in her bed being jolted by aftershocks, we ventured outside once daylight came. We walked west on Pico and then north on Robertson, looking in all the store front windows. One store would be in perfect order, the next would look like a tornado had struck. Shards of shattered glass hung ominously from upstairs windows like murderous icicles; we walked in the street to avoid them. Brick fireplaces attached to the houses in the neighborhood lay crumbled in the yards. When we finally felt normal(ish), we went to Damiano's Pizza on Fairfax for lunch; they had gas-powered pizza ovens so the fact that the power was out didn't prevent them from opening for business — cash only.

My husband and I were living in a high-rise condo in West Hollywood. The building shook violently, but amazingly there was not much damage. Just a few things flew off shelves. The power lines arcing in bright white light and then everything going black. There are the first moments when your mind is racing and you are trying to decide what to do next; do we evacuate or stay in place. What I remember most is the aftershocks that seemed to last for days. Just when you felt your life was getting back to normal and aftershock would hit and you wondered if it was going to be another big one.

I was living in West LA at the time, but the morning of the earthquake I was camping at Joshua Tree. All night long I was kept awake by animals scurrying about outside the tent. The previous night had been quiet. As I was breaking camp to head back to LA, a ranger stopped by and told me about the earthquake -- ""Ah"" I thought, ""That's why the animals were so riled up last night."" It was confirmation that they really do sense when an earthquake is coming and I'll never forget it!

It was very early in the morning. My roommate, Paula Locati, was getting up to go to her job working on the stock exchange. There's this huge bang and it felt like my bed had dropped 5 feet. Then the rumbling began. I ran to my door and opened it, and my roommate ran into me, and grabbed me . I heldentenor both her and the door jamb, as the apartment began to shake all around us. And it just went on and on. I'd been in earthquakes before, both in California and Japan, but I had never experienced anything that went on as long as that. The entertainment center in the living room crashed down. My roommate screamed. The building felt like it was traveling in slow lazy circles. I was convinced that the loft portion on the second for the apartment was going to come down. After what I believe was nearly a minute, it's stopped. We went out into the living room. One of our cats crept with his belly to the ground for a week. The aftershocks occurred all the time. I think people forget how many hundreds upon hundreds of aftershocks there were. A water main outside my house broke along with a gas main and fire was spitting out of the flooded intersection at Tujunga and Riverside, about 500 feet from my place. I remember for miles around every home with a brick fireplace, it had collapsed. That night, I drove across town from North Hollywood to Venice Beach to get my girlfriend. There was a building on Olympic whose face seemed to be coming off. It look like the entire building's facade was about to fall into the street. We spent the night together huddled up against the aftershocks. And have been together nearly twenty years. My roommate died of a brain tumor, just a few years later, at the age of 27.",NO
795,rd_html,"AMHERST, Ohio - One hundred years ago, three trains collided on the tracks in what is now Amherst's Sandstone Village, killing 27 people and seriously injuring 47. The tragedy created heroes, drew villains and allowed Mary Pickford, the greatest film actress of the day, to play a real-life heroine.

On March 29, to mark the anniversary of the disaster, Amherst erected a simple, somber monument to tell the story of the city's catastrophe at Sandstone Village, a recreated 1800s town on Milan Avenue.

Historian Jim Wilhelm, who also serves as the assistant fire chief of Amherst, has made it his personal mission to educate people about the tragedy.

It started with two trains headed east to Pittsburgh and ultimately New York City. The second train had been added to carry the overflow from the crowded first train, and it followed nine minutes behind it.

As the first train approached the old Amherst switching station around 3:15 a.m., the engineer stopped because a danger signal light was on. Heavy fog kept the engineer from seeing very far down the tracks. He got out to talk to the switching station worker, fearing there was a broken track or an obstacle on the tracks ahead.

""It turned out to be a bogus signal,"" Wilhelm said. ""It turned itself off before the engineer reached the tower. The engineer got back on board and tried to get the train moving again. That was the trouble, he could not get it moving from the dead stop. The wheels spun on the tracks.""

The train finally started to inch forward. The dense fog prevented the engineer on the second train from seeing that the first one was barely moving.

""He plowed right into it,"" Wilhelm said. ""The second train tore right through the two rear cars of the first train, and knocked other cars over onto the tracks.""

Minutes later, a westbound train, headed from New York to Los Angeles, crashed into the derailed trains.

Wilhelm said the sounds of the crash and the sounds of trapped victims screaming cut through the still night and could be heard for miles.

Thousands of people converged at the crash site.

Some came to render whatever assistance they could. Although 27 people were killed in the crash, a 28th died the next day of injuries, and at least 47 people were badly injured. Missing or crushed arms and legs and massive head injuries were common. Doctors, nurses and rescue workers helped the injured and transported them to nearby hospitals.

Other heroes were the workers who had the monumental task of moving hundreds of tons of twisted metal off the tracks.

Still others drawn to the scene were heartless thieves.

""It was pretty awful,"" said Wilhelm. ""People were stealing whatever they found at the crash scene. There was so much going on the police could not prevent it all. One man in Lorain actually stole a scalp that was torn from the head of one of the victims. Lorain police learned about the theft and confiscated the scalp.""

Lurid newspaper headlines shouted about victims screaming in agony and about looters stealing from the victims.

But Wilhelm likes to talk about the heroes, and there were many.

Among them was a wispy young woman of 24 named Mary Pickford, the most famous silent film actress of her time. With her was another actress, Ella Hall, who served as her understudy.

""The railroad people managed to get one engine and several cars righted and able to move,"" Wilhelm said. ""They loaded up the injured and others, and prepared to take them to the hospital in Elyria. Pickford and Hall refused to go, they wanted to stay and help the injured. In her time, Pickford was bigger than Meryl Streep is today, she was the biggest star in movies, but she chose to stay and help.""

That came as no surprise to Cari Beauchamp, who works for the Mary Pickford Foundation, a charity that spends millions to help people in need.

""She was always philanthropic,"" she said. ""She always ran toward people in need, not away. She was the founder of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, now called the Motion Picture Television Fund, that helps people in the industry. Her entire life she was concerned about the poor and the elderly.""

Beauchamp said Pickford was returning to Los Angeles after finishing the film, ""Hulda From Holland,"" which was being shot in upstate New York. Ella Hall was also a star, but not as well-known as Pickford.

Oddly enough, Pickford's role in the crash's aftermath went unnoticed by Ohio newspapers. Other newspapers, including the New York Times, wrote about her.

""Mary Pickford and Ella Hall were on board the 20th Century Limited returning from New York to their studio on the Pacific coast,"" reported the Kansas City Globe on March 30, 1916. ""They got out and worked with the injured. (They) bandaged arms, heads and legs of those being brought from the wreckage.""

Pickford, known as ""America's Sweetheart,"" was one of the last people to leave the scene, making sure that the injured were first taken away for help.

She and Hall were not the only heroic women on that train.

Mrs. Robert Hotz had just completed training as a nurse at St. Joseph Hospital Nursing School in Lorain. She was returning to Chicago after boarding in Elyria, minutes before her westbound train crashed into the other two.

""She immediately went to work,"" said Wilhelm. ""She is credited with saving eight to 10 people who would have died if not for her efforts. She put every bit of training she just learned to use that morning.""

Wilhelm has put together a 14-panel display that tells the story of the crash, its aftermath and the people involved. He will occasionally put on displays in Amherst, even taking the show to nearby cities when asked.

The monument to the train crash stands less than 75 feet from where the crash occurred, on the tracks above Sandstone Village, which was created by the Amherst Historical Society.

Watch the Amherst Historical Society's website for announcements of future showings of the display.

Any chance of putting the whole story on a web page?

""I don't think so,"" Wilhelm said as he carefully folded up the display and put the panels into a protective bag. ""I think this is something that people need to see up close, to feel what it must have been like.""",YES

KINGSBURG, Calif. (KFSN) -- A man died in Kingsburg after a freight train hit his semi-truck on Thursday, sparking flames and explosions.
The crash happened on the railway tracks in the area of Sierra and Simpson just off Highway 99.
The resulting blast was so intense that parts of the engine went flying feet away and the safety arm that lowers when a train is approaching was blown off.
The driver of the truck did not survive. The train crew was not injured.
A witness, Mickey P, said he saw the semi-truck on the railway track and the train crossing-arms come down on its hood.
Moments later, the train crashed into the truck, sparking flames and an explosion.
""It was instant, just 'boom'... catastrophic!"" Mickey P told Action News.
Footage from the scene shows thick black smoke billowing in huge clouds, visible from miles away.
The police department still doesn't know how or why the semi-truck driver didn't get off the tracks before being hit.
Kingsburg PD says a crash like this is unusual in their town.
They are hoping an eyewitness or cell phone video from the moments leading up to the crash will help them figure out why it happened.
On Friday, railroad crews worked to repair the safety arms that were blown off Thursday night.

Someone stole it on Tuesday, leaving her heartbroken.

530,tf_url,"For “Bullet Train” star Aaron Taylor-Johnson, working on set of the action-packed Brad Pitt film was a strenuous yet hilarious adventure. That is, until an on-set accident landed him in the hospital.

“I was on some crazy mad Keto diet,” Taylor-Johnson told Variety at the Los Angeles premiere of “Bullet Train” on Monday night. “Because I got all scrawny and lean for this, so I basically had low blood sugar levels. We were in a fight sequence and I get drop-kicked across the room. And the one sharp bit of the corner where there wasn’t any padding took a chunk out of my hand. And I literally went wham, passed out. And then I came back and was like ‘Should we go again?’ And they were like ‘No, no, no. You gotta go get stitches at the hospital.’ So then I spent the night in the hospital.”

“Bullet Train” stars Pitt as a hitman who has to fight his way through a train filled with assassins portrayed by Taylor-Johnson, Bad Bunny, Joey King and Brian Tyree Henry. When the group discovers that all of their assignments are related, the high-speed train turns into a battlefield. David Leitch, known for action films such as “Deadpool 2” and “Atomic Blonde,” directed the film.

“You know, when you sign up for a David Leitch movie you know you gotta get a couple battle scars,” Taylor-Johnson said. “Some war wounds.”

Despite Taylor-Johnson’s accident, he says he “had a lot of fun” filming.

“We all just came and had fun, you know,” Taylor-Johnson said. “David Leitch gave us so much room to improv and ad-lib, and we really just wanted to make these characters pop. I mean, it’s such a heightened reality, the tone of this movie. [These characters] are so bombastic, so you wanna make them lifted and pop. So hopefully we’ve done that.”

315,np_url,"SHERMAN, Wis. — On Wednesday at 2:08 p.m., the Sheboygan County emergency officials received reports of a crash involving a semi-truck and a train in the Town of Sherman, which is in southwestern Sheboygan County.

The Sheboygan County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) said the crash occurred in the west 5100 block of Abbott Drive.

SCSO said when deputies reached the scene of the crash, they found a semi-truck with an attached tanker on its side in a ditch. The truck had been transporting about 5,000 gallons of liquid manure. The semi-truck was traveling west on Abbott Drive and crossed a railway crossing.

As it crossed, the semi-truck was hit by a Wisconsin Southern train traveling north.

SCSO said the semi-truck driver, Jeffery S. Blankenheim, died as a result of the crash. The 66-year-old man was from Kewaskum.

SCSO said no other injuries were reported.

The train’s engine and six of its estimated 22 cars were derailed. Only one derailed car lost some of its plastic pellet contents.

SCSO said the railway crossing did have a yield sign on Abbott Drive. However, there are no lights or gates there.

Donald Vruwink is the railroad commissioner for the state. He said there hasn’t been an accident at this train crossing since 1989, but said it’s not unusual for a something like this to happen in a spot like this.

“In most cases, when we see these accidents happen it’s in these rural areas without gates and lights that just have a yield signs and people get complacent because there are only two trains that come through a day,” Vruwink said.

Lisa Pfund and her grandson, Jackson, live just a few hundred feet from the wreckage. She said she’s always worried this could happen due to vehicles driving excessive speeds on Abbott Drive.

“When I hear it go through at night I just wait for the crash because nobody slows down, nobody stops, nobody yields,” Pfund said.

Vruwink encouraged Wisconsin residents to report excessive speeding near railroad crossings so his team can investigate and find solutions.

With the investigation into the crash is underway, Abbott Drive will be closed westbound from State Highway 57. Vehicles entering from the west will need to turn south on Allen Road. Officials said the investigation could take several days and re-opening would also be dependent on repairs.

SCSO said there’s no hazard or danger to the community at this time.

Two men were killed in a fiery crash early Monday after a driver fled from a police traffic stop in Hollywood and crashed into a Metro van, authorities said.

The crash at Hollywood Boulevard and Gower Street occurred just before 2 a.m., police said.

A patrol unit had pulled over a silver Chevrolet Camaro around 1:30 a.m., and an officer was questioning a passenger outside the car when the driver took off, according to Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Tony Im.

1256,rd_url,"There's only one place to cross the railway legally to get to the beach in Del Mar. But instead of adding more safe crossings, transit officials want to add 1.4 miles of fencing along the bluffs starting this fall.
And that means making sure the city of Del Mar and the California Coastal Commission stay out of the way.
The fencing plan was shot down by the city council in November, 2018 over concerns about public access, and the North County Transit District fears more opposition. So the agency, which owns the railroad and adjacent right-of-way, has requested a federal “declaratory order” that would remove local control over the bluff and tracks.
The petition, filed August 28, names the city of Del Mar and the Coastal Commission as parties. It would give the transit district veto authority over objections to its work on the coaster commuter rail line that runs north and south along the coast between Oceanside and San Diego.
""This will be a great loss for the entire community — cutting off beach access for thousands of people, ruining the landscape, and creating safety risk for anyone caught inside the fence,"" says a change.org petition started by a Del Mar resident.
Transit officials say it's essential for public safety, and providing uninterrupted service. Fencing projects in Encinitas and Oceanside have been recommended by the agency.
Trespassers are common in the right-of-way along the bluffs, resulting in accidents and deaths. According to the agency, there have been 112 fatalities and 174 incidents on the coaster commuter rail line since 2010. In Del Mar alone, there have been eight fatalities and 14 incidents since 2014.
Overall, the county is in ninth place for the highest number of rail casualties in the U.S. The Federal Railroad Administration attributes it mainly to the convenience of trespassing and lack of fencing or enforcement.
Behind the fence fight looms a battle over the bluffs. According to the San Diego Association of Governments, the Del Mar bluffs average about six inches of erosion per year due to storm and irrigation runoff and sea rise. Del Mar wants the priority to be moving the rail inland.
Last November, emergency stabilization of the bluffs was required after collapses due to heavy rains. The city jumped in, seeking review by the Coastal Commission, which the transit district says ""would impose sweeping mitigation requirements on NCTD and the eventual relocation of the existing railroad line, and potentially the construction of a multibillion dollar underground tunnel.""
The petition cites the city council's rejection of safety fencing. ""NCTD justifiably is concerned that a similar federal consistency review or Coastal Act challenge to this fencing project is forthcoming,""
Adding to the tension, the agency is planning two more major bluff stabilization projects in Del Mar in the near term. These and other crucial maintenance projects, they say, ""will be challenged under the Coastal Act or local coastal laws by Del Mar or the Commission.""
The city has until October 5 to reply to the petition and submit comments to the Surface Transportation Board.

Adding to the tension, the agency is planning two more major bluff stabilization projects in Del Mar in the near term. These and other crucial maintenance projects, they say, ""will be challenged under the Coastal Act or local coastal laws by Del Mar or the Commission.""
The city has until October 5 to reply to the petition and submit comments to the Surface Transportation Board.

A pilot was killed after two small-engine planes collided in midair over Lancaster on Sunday afternoon, officials said.
Federal authorities said they were looking into the crash, which a Los Angeles County sheriff’s spokesperson said occurred about 12:50 p.m.
Firefighters arrived at the scene of a downed plane near 47th Street East and Avenue F about 1:20 p.m., said L.A. County Fire Capt. Sheila Kelliher-Berkoh. A second downed aircraft was near 60th Street East and Avenue G, Kelliher-Berkoh said.
One of the pilots was pronounced dead at the scene, but the other pilot was uninjured, she said. Although details of the incident were remain scarce, it appears the two planes collided above Lancaster, Kelliher-Berkoh said.
It wasn’t known Monday afternoon what caused the crash, she said.
No passengers were on either plane.
The National Transportation Safety Board “is investigating the midair collision of a Yakovlev Yak-52 and Nanchang CJ-6A near Lancaster,” the agency said in a statement Sunday afternoon.
The Yak-52 is a single-engine craft designed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The CJ-6A was originally produced in the 1960s for the Chinese military. Both are known to be used in aerobatics.

During a special panel presentation at San Diego Comic-Con 2024 (SDCC 2024) this past summer, stars Wendy Schaal, Scott Grimes, Rachael MacFarlane, Dee Bradley Baker, and Jeff Fischer (minus very busy Seth MacFarlane), and executive producers Matt Weitzman, Kara Vallow, and Nic Wegener shared some serious intel on what's to come with American Dad ahead of its return this fall to TBS (we'll get to that in a minute). Now, we know when that return will be, with TBS releasing a new teaser announcing that the hit animated series will be back with new episodes beginning Monday, October 28 at 10 pm ET/PT. What can we expect? The Smiths are overjoyed when the Langley Falls boardwalk reopens – but see their dreams of climbing Mount Everest turn into a nightmare. Meanwhile, Roger is struck with a mysterious illness, Klaus contends with an imposter, and much more. In terms of guest stars, we can expect to hear the voices of Charles Barkley, Michael Imperioli, Leslie Jones, Joel McHale, Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart, Gabriel ""Fluffy"" Iglesias, Neal McDonough, and both Kevin Bacon & Kyra Sedgwick.

In the images and previews that were previously released, we got a sense of some of the season's storylines – including one that sees Roger and Stan (both Seth MacFarlane) needing to join bodies to recover from a train accident. In another episode, Rogu (Dee Bradley Baker) is dealing with a potentially fatal illness – so guess which family decides to pretend that they're doctors to save him? Also, viewers can look forward to a Christmas episode (we're guessing that this one would be a Santa Claus-free holiday episode if the tradition of trading off years continues) as well as… another Klaus rap. Yup, you read that correctly. While you're processing that, make sure to note one of the images, in particular – it appears we're also getting an ""old-timey"" animated episode.

Here's a look at the image gallery that was previously released – with an extended look at the show's return waiting for you above.

What To Do After A Car Accident In Santa Clarita, CA

No one can predict a car crash or collision, but you can prepare for one. A car accident checklist in your glove box can help you stay calm and organized after a car crash. It can tell you what to do, what not to do, and how best to protect your rights. You aren’t alone after a collision, no matter how big or small you think it may be.

Whether you are the injured victim or the family of a deceased loved one, here’s what to do after a car accident:

Stay Calm – Stay on the scene and make sure everyone is okay. Check yourself for injuries first, and then check others. Remain calm, and try your best to regain composure. Get to a Safe Location – Move your vehicle or pull over to the side of the road if you can. Put your emergency flashers on to warn other motorists of the accident. This gives them a heads-up to slow down as they approach. Get somewhere safe to wait for the police. Call 911 – Call the authorities to report your accident as soon as possible. The police can document the incident, gather information, and make it part of an official record. Exchange Information – Swap names, phone numbers, and insurance information with the other driver(s) involved in the accident. If possible, take photos of the vehicles, license plates, and other vital details. Do Not Admit Fault – This is a common mistake people make following any vehicular accident. When speaking with a police officer, stick only to the facts of what happened, but never admit fault or say “sorry.” Nevertheless, be as detailed as possible in your description of the collision. Seek Medical Attention – Go to the hospital or your primary doctor immediately. Immediate medical care can help reduce the damage you suffer from injuries. Tests and scans can identify internal injuries that may not show symptoms yet. Report to Your Insurance Company – Most insurers have time limits for how soon you must report an accident in California. Call quickly and follow the agent’s directions to report your crash. Speak to Insurance Adjusters – As soon as the day of your accident, you may receive a phone call from the other party’s insurance company. You may speak to the claims adjuster, but do not give away any more information than is necessary. Do not record a statement or accept an insurance settlement offer until you speak to an attorney. Create a File – Keep accident-related documents together and organized. Your file should include a copy of the police report, medical bills, the other driver’s information, injury treatment plans, and any other documents you’ve collected regarding the incident. Call Our Car Accident Lawyers – When in doubt, call us at (888) 488-1391. We offer free consultations so you can discuss your car crash without risk or obligation.

743,tf_url,"Community Corner Paralyzed In Bike Accident, Retired Pleasanton Cop Fighting Back Mike Dunn, who once served his country and community in the military, law enforcement, and church, was suddenly unable to care for himself.

PLEASANTON, CA — One day retired Pleasanton police officer Mike Dunn was hitting the road to ride his bicycle and the next day he was a quadriplegic. Just minutes after the avid bicyclist set out to train for a 50-mile mountain ride, the “road broke apart under his tire” and he was thrown to the ground and unable to move. Eventually, a Good Samaritan found Dunn and got him help.

Doctors delivered a devastating diagnosis when they determined Dunn, 63, suffered an “incomplete spinal cord injury” during the accident. In the blink of an eye, life forever changed for the father, pastor, retired police officer and military veteran. The man who once served his country and community in the military, law enforcement and the church was suddenly unable to care for himself and forced to rely on family, friends and a team of medical professionals to help him survive. Since that ill-fated day in 2016, Dunn has been on a long and painful journey as he works to recover. Dunn once stopped eating during a church trip to Africa so he could better understand the pain of starvation. That explains the grit he's shown adapting to his life-changing injury. A former Marine, Dunn was trained to “adapt and overcome” in any situation.

He worked for the Los Angeles Police Department and retired in 2014 from the Pleasanton Police Department. He spent time working for the United States Marshals Service in San Francisco. Dunn was known as kind, compassionate and full of life. Dunn’s family told Patch that in the months since his accident, they have received incredible support from those who know him.

“When someone you love suffers an injury, like Mike did, the emotional pain combined with the worry is overwhelming and suffocating at times. Mike’s friends, some of whom he has not seen since high school, have been nothing short of a Godsend. Mike is overwhelmed and humbled, as are we, with the outpouring of love and generosity. We can not in a million years convey the gratitude we have for everybody who is donating to this cause and especially for the organizers, without whom this would not be happening. We love you all.” Much of his care has been covered by the Veterans Health Administration but his family and friends say that Dunn will need significant financial support as he transitions to a new living situation once his time in his current care facility wraps up. Cathy Noble, a friend of Dunn’s, launched a GoFundMe page to help with his medical costs and equipment needed, like a modified van, ramps, a special bed and full-time care. The page has garnered more than $6800 since it was launched on May 12. Those interested in donating can click here.",NO

          A clown Sunday pauses after placing flowers at Showmen’s Rest monument during a memorial ceremony at Woodlawn Cemetery in Forest Park for circus artists who died in a 1918 train accident.            Kids in attendance received free clown noses and Josh Negron, 7, of Berwyn, kept his on.              Brelyn Magnuson, 6, sits in the lap of her mother, Jelly Beanz, during the ceremony.            Kristi Taff does a hand-balancing act for the crowd.              Cool Beanz raises a clown banner and the American Flag to begin a ceremony that honored dead circus artists buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Forest Park.     Men and women in colorful wigs and giant shoes gathered at a Forest Park cemetery, Aug. 4, to perform clowning and acrobatic acts. Clowns from around the region celebrated the 14th International Clown Week at the most famous final resting place for circus artists: Showman’s Rest in Woodlawn Cemetery. Acrobats and jugglers performed in front of the section’s five elephant statues, each with trunks lowered, depicting mourningDeath and clowns: For some, perhaps, life’s two most frightening concepts.
The group comes to Forest Park every year to honor the victims of the June 22, 1918 Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus train wreck near Ivanhoe, Ind.
That summer night, a circus train carrying 400 performers and roustabouts on the way to Hammond, made an emergency stop at 4 a.m. to cool down overheated machinery. Red lights were turned on to warn approaching trains. But the engineer of an empty troop train had fallen asleep. The troop train hit the circus train at full speed, the collision destroying three cars full of sleeping circus people. Others were trapped in the wreckage when a fire broke out. Eighty-six died, most of the bodies unrecognizable.But the show must go on, and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus missed just a single performance: in Hammond that day. Borrowing acts from Ringling Brothers and other circuses, they played the next night in Beloit, Wis.Between 55 and 60 train crash victims are buried in Showman’s Rest. Many performers were known only by their nicknames, so headstones read “Baldy,” “Smiley” and “4 horse driver.” The 750-plot section had been purchased only months earlier by the Showman’s League of America.At Saturday’s ceremony, a somber history of the train disaster was read, the Clown Prayer was recited and performers laid flowers at the feet of one of the elephants.
But being “outdoor amusement people,” no one could stay solemn for long.Rubber noses and funny glasses were handed out to children. Clowns Cool Beanz and Jelly Beanz performed an act. The Vagabonds of Glenview’s Runaway Circus performed acrobatic tricks, rode unicycles, juggled blue and red pins and balanced cups on strings. Founder Sarah Koshelev is an alumna of Illinois State University’s Gamma Phi Circus School.The memorial gathering is a labor of love, orchestrated primarily by Susan Hooper, or “Sweetie” the Clown. Hooper also attended Gamma Phi and is a member of the Triton Troupers at Triton College. She juggles, breathes fire, walks on stilts and performs on a mini-bike at birthday parties and special events. Although clowning is her avocation, not her career, she brings performers together as a “loving and festive remembrance of circus artists past.” The event takes three months to organize.Woodlawn Manager Ty Woods, who billed himself “the only clown in a suit,” said he tries to bring people to the cemetery for reasons other than funerals. Woodlawn provided free hot dogs, beverages and chips for the event.And what of “coulrophobia,” the fear of clowns? Clowns can be scary for some. John Wayne Gacy dressed as a clown at birthday parties and painted clown pictures in prison.None of that bothered Brookfield resident Mark Seelentag, who attended the event for the thrill, wearing a top-hat and Marylyn Manson-esque makeup. His daughter, Harley, dressed as the Joker’s girlfriend Harlequin.“When I heard about this, I thought, ‘Clowns in the cemetery? Yes!'” he said. On his T-shirt was an image of the fang-toothed Pennywise, the clown from the Stephen King movie It.“Clowns entertain everyone,” Seelentag said. “They can be scary, sad or happy. Either way it keeps your heart pumping and it’s fun.”VIDEOChanges in clowning and circuses Organizer Susan Hooper is a longtime fan of the “traditional American circus” and many of the clowns attending were dressed in the traditional garb, evoking the era of the most famous American clown, Emmett Kelly, and his character “Weary Willy.”The American circus, long steeped in its traditions and unchanged since the turn of the century, has been forced to evolve, prodded by more splashy acts like Cirque du Soleil and Cirque de Shanghai, Hooper said.As a clown nostalgic for the past, Hooper observes wistfully how American circuses grudgingly adapted.“Cirque [du Soleil] came in and paved the way for changes in the circus with their music and presentation and the kind of acts they do,” Hooper said.“The traditional American circus had to reinvent itself to keep up with the times. It used to be a five-ringed circus; now it’s a one-ring circus with elaborate themes and big production, props and lights.”Noel Williams, a clown with the Runaway Circus, was trained in the Canadian Pochinko clowning tradition, which focuses on clowns with personalities.She said the traditional American clown was meant to be seen “from the big top.”“They wear exaggerated makeup and clothes because they were supposed to be seen from far away. When they’re up close, yes that can be a little scary.”“There’s a place for every kind of clown,” said Williams, “service clowns, traditional circus clowns, European and Asian clowns, even birthday-party clowns. There’s a place for all of us.”Though the Showman’s Rest celebration was inspired by a tragic event, the clowns left the crowd laughing.“It is said that the heart of a clown is sad,” read one clown, “but that is because he leaves happiness wherever he goes and takes misery with him.”“Outdoor amusement people are here to entertain and bring joy to others,” said Jean Brake of the Showman’s League’s Ladies’ Auxiliary. “We make people feel good.”

1038,rd_html,"MORENO VALLEY – A driver died when their car smashed into a telephone pole and several trees Saturday, March 25. The early-morning, single-vehicle wreck happened in the 17700 block of Lasselle Street between Avenida Classica and Via De Anza, near Rancho Verde High School, in Moreno Valley.

Moreno Valley Police and Fire personnel and other emergency first responders were dispatched to the scene of the fatal crash about 2:30 a.m., after Riverside County emergency dispatchers were notified about the wreck.

Callers told dispatchers a car had struck a telephone pole and that the impact sheared the telephone pole in half – leaving live lines dangling over nearby trees, the vehicle and in the street. A concrete light pole was also damaged in the collision.

When they arrived, officials found vehicle parts, debris and sections of the telephone pole strewn about the roadway after the wreck.

Authorities located the mangled wreckage of a car that had smashed into the pole and trees. The car, which was completely unrecognizable after the wreck, was found upside down amidst broken tree branches and the sheared power pole.

Emergency medical personnel were initially unable to gain access to the mortally injured driver or the vehicle due to live power lines that were left draped over the vehicle.

Southern California Edison workers were summoned to the scene to de-energize the live wires and assess the damage to the pole, according to Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Public Information Officer Jody Hagemann. Crews were later forced to remove and replace the pole.

The driver and sole-occupant of the car “suffered multiple traumatic injuries,” Riverside Sheriff’s Sergeant William Stens explained in a written press release after the incident.

The victim succumbed to their injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The victim has not been identified, pending notification of their family.

The Moreno Valley Police Traffic Reconstruction Team responded to the scene of the deadly crash and assumed the investigation.

Their preliminary investigation determined the car was traveling southbound on Lasselle Street when – for an unknown reason – the driver lost control, left the roadway and smashed into the pole and trees.

Traffic Team members were working to determine the speed of the car at the time of the crash. Alcohol and/or drug intoxication have not been ruled out, pending toxicology reports.

Southbound Lasselle Street was closed for several hours between Avenida Classica and Via De Anza while sheriff’s officials conducted their investigation into the fatal crash.

The road closure was expected to remain in effect until repairs could be made to the destroyed power pole.

Moreno Valley police officials are investigating the cause of the deadly wreck. Their investigation is active and ongoing.

Anyone with information about the incident or who witnessed the fatal collision are encouraged to contact officials at Moreno Valley PD at (951) 486-6700. Callers can refer to incident file number MV170840033 and can remain anonymous. Citizens may also submit a tip using the Sheriff’s CrimeTips online form.

On Friday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said that it’s proposing self-driving vehicle tests be allowed on public roads for heavy-duty trucks and other large vehicles, as detailed in a report from Reuters. The news comes as heavy-duty vehicles about 10,001 pounds are currently unable to utilize public self-driving tests in California, as well as others such as Texas, Arizona, and Arkansas.
The proposal would restrict autonomous testing for semi-trucks and other oversized vehicles to specified, pre-selected routes that would be pre-determined to be legal for size, weight, and loading requirements. It would also ban testing these vehicles on city streets, with selected routes primarily including major highways.
The state would also prohibit testing of specific heavy-duty vehicles until further notice under the proposal, including household movers, commercial vehicles used to transport passengers, oversize loads, bulk liquids, or hazardous materials.

READ MORE ON SELF-DRIVING FOR HEAVY-DUTY TRUCKS:

The DMV plans to hold a public hearing on the proposal on June 10, after which point it would be allowed to move forward with the agency.
California has been preparing regulations for autonomous trucking since at least last August, when the state submitted an initial draft for such a legal framework.
The state is also evaluating whether light-duty vehicle testing requirements should be updated. Currently, the state requires a permit to test self-driving vehicles utilizing a safety driver, before applying for subsequent phases of driverless testing and deployment permits.
To apply for driverless testing permits, manufacturers are required to conduct testing for a minimum of 50,000 miles, while heavy-duty manufacturers would be required to complete at least 500,000 autonomous testing miles under the proposal. Of them, up to 40,000 of the miles are allowed to be completed outside of California.
The news also follows the Trump administration’s aims to accelerate self-driving deployment this week through the expansion of exemptions for certain reporting requirements.
Although Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) is not currently available for the company’s electric Semi, it’s expected to become available at some point in the future. Tesla has also been spotted testing its FSD on the Semi in and around Giga Nevada, ahead of the company’s plans to launch the software on the Class 8 truck.
Tesla is currently aiming to ramp up production of the Semi, and it’s constructing an expansion to its Gigafactory in Nevada to eventually scale up to volume production.

923,gs_url,"These are various thoughts and observations, prompted by a tragic story.
This is coming from a distance, words about a person I don't know well, about a death whose precise circumstances we don't yet know for sure.
Was Eddie Griffin trying to kill himself when he drove his SUV past railroad gates and flashing lights and into the side of a moving freight train in Houston last week? It will likely be some time before an investigation is complete, just as it took more than four days to identify Griffin because his body was burned so badly in the fiery crash that dental records were required for identification.
But what we do know of Griffin is this: The stream of incidents, arrests and unsuccessful stints in rehabilitation centers allows us to list him as Exhibit A in the argument that just because you can enter the NBA, that doesn't mean you should.
An ex-player I talked to Tuesday called Griffin ""a perfect example of a kid who shouldn't have went to the NBA early.""
I saw the other extreme over the weekend in Las Vegas, where young men with zero or one year of college experience such as LeBron James, Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant were gathered for the Team USA training camp. These are people who have stayed out of trouble, who seem capable of handling the extreme world of the NBA. Griffin's failures should not be a reason to deny opportunities for those who are ready.
But they should serve as a warning, a reminder that the most important part of college isn't the course credits, it's the socialization. It's about making the transition to adulthood in a sheltered environment where the mistakes aren't as costly as they are in the real world.
It's clear Griffin never learned to be responsible or accountable during his one year at Seton Hall or the six seasons he spent in the NBA. Maybe his problems were too serious for anyone in the league to deal with, even if teams' top priorities hadn't been making money and winning games. Regardless, it was the wrong environment for someone so unstable. Youth and money and loads of unsupervised time were a toxic combination for him.
Griffin also is a case study in the temptation of talent.
Because of a fight with a teammate, he had to finish high school by studying at home instead of going to class and walking across a stage to get his diploma. In his year at Seton Hall, he punched out a teammate in the locker room.
And yet the Rockets traded the rights to their three first-round draft picks (Jason Collins, Richard Jefferson and Brandon Armstrong) to get Griffin's draft rights in 2001.
While in Houston, Griffin pleaded guilty in an assault case, and yet the Nets and then the Minnesota Timberwolves signed him to free-agent contracts. He later was jailed for violating probation, and yet the Timberwolves re-signed him, this time to a three-year, $8.1 million extension. They wound up cutting him loose in March.
Before his self-destructive tendencies turned deadly, they were expensive. Before he cost those who loved him the chance to see him again, he cost teams money, players and time. But who's to blame for that?
There's a blinding arrogance teams get when they covet talent. They think they can make it work for them, when all the evidence suggests otherwise.
Late Tuesday night I talked to someone who did know Griffin well, Houston Rockets vice president of basketball operations and athletic trainer Keith Jones.
Jones last saw Griffin at a restaurant in Houston in May. He said Griffin seemed alert and optimistic. He talked about his daughter. He said his troubles, the most recent of which was a league-imposed substance abuse suspension that effectively ended his stay in Minnesota, were behind him
""I said, 'Eddie, you always tell me, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" then I find out different,'"" Jones said. ""He said, 'I'm taking care of it.'""
Sounds like the voice of an addict, never acknowledging the extent of the problem.
As the dialogue implied, Jones had had that type of conversation with Griffin before. He knew Griffin well enough that the news of his death saddened him, but didn't completely surprise him.
""I can't say it shocks me,"" Jones said. ""It's still really sad and really tragic. And Eddie was a good guy. He had a good heart. He made some bad decisions on a lot of things. I think he had people that were guiding him, that he thought were guiding him, that didn't have his best interests in heart.""
Jones said the Rockets did what they could to look after him while he played for them. In addition to the league-mandated rookie orientation program the incoming players are required to attend, the Rockets had a team security staffer look after Griffin. And they worked with a realtor who not only helped Griffin buy a home, she helped him with the details of life, such as opening a checking account.
""I thought we did a good job providing some guidance for him,"" Jones said. ""And giving him something solid to work with and solid people to look after him.
""You can't be with him 24 hours a day. You can only do so much. If a guy doesn't want help and isn't ready to change, he isn't going to.""
By the time they get to the NBA, it's too late.
""There's those things that he didn't learn that most 17-, 18-, 19-year-old guys learn at some point, from their father or some other male figure,"" Jones said.
""Eddie was one of those AAU phenoms. They didn't teach him, they brought him along to win games. There's one more statistic, right there.""
Jones is left with one last, nagging thought.
""I know he trusted me,"" Jones said. ""I know he knew I never asked him for anything, never wanted anything except for him to be successful. The whole thing that bugs me is I wish he would have trusted me enough, if he was drinking, or whatever happened, that he would call. If something was bothering him, he would have called one more time.""
I can't believe some of the strange and sad phrases associated with Griffin that came out while doing some research on him. These old news stories here and here (which I found through a Minnesota-based Web site called MNspeak.com) contained the unusual charge of ""deadly conduct"" and a probation violation for ""consorting with disreputable people.""
In March 2004 Griffin plea-bargained to a misdemeanor charge of deadly conduct after facing a felony charge of aggravated assault that stemmed from an accusation that he punched and shot at a woman who came across Griffin with another woman in his Houston house. That prompts two questions: (1) How can something as serious-sounding as ""deadly conduct"" only be a misdemeanor? (2) In retrospect, wasn't his adult life an extended episode of deadly conduct, one practically destined for an early fatality?
The deadly conduct guilty plea resulted in an 18-month probation. While serving it, Griffin was sentenced to 15 days in jail because he was at a Houston nightclub when a fight broke out.
A court official said Griffin violated probation because he was ""consorting with disreputable people."" I wonder how many people would be better off if we consistently made that a jailable offense, if we forced them to choose between the company they keep and their best interests.
We've seen how Michael Vick was unable to escape his crowd and its dogfighting culture. While Griffin, apparently, was not surrounded by people who could guide him to the right path, in the end he wasn't able to escape himself.
The 2001 draft is starting to resemble the cursed Class of 1986 when it comes to tragedy and disappointment.
Griffin's death follows the failure of No. 1 overall pick Kwame Brown in Washington, the unrealized potential of Tyson Chandler and the bad behavior of Zach Randolph that caused the Trail Blazers to dump a 20-and-10 guy for a player they didn't even want to keep.
Likewise, the 1986 draft was overshadowed by the cocaine-overdose death of Len Bias, and drug-wasted careers of Chris Washburn and Roy Tarpley, plus the injury-shortened career of top pick Brad Daugherty.
One of my first reactions to the sad news was that I never really got to know Eddie Griffin. Later I realized that's because he never played in the playoffs. The playoffs are when casual fans get to know players' names and faces, and when we in the media get to know out-of-town players' personalities. You spend a week or two with a team over the course of a series and you get a little sense for who they are. But he never played in May, a sad reflection on his career and the teams that acquired him.
If most sports fans remember him at all, it's probably because last season he was in a car crash that witnesses said occurred because he was driving while watching a porno DVD and masturbating. That was good for a few yuks around the blogosphere. But maybe we should have taken it more seriously, recognizing it for what it was: a sign of his descent.
It was a warning that went ignored, just as, surely, some other unprepared teenager will someday fail to pay attention to the lessons of Eddie Griffin, and some team will take that risk.

555,gs_html,"Authorities Friday identified the pilot of a small plane who died when the aircraft crashed alongside the westbound 210 Freeway in the Sylmar area.

John King, 62, died at the scene of the crash, which occurred around 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to the coroner's office. King was the only person aboard the plane, Eva Lee Ngai of the FAA said.

Records revealed that the plane was built in 1965, with a valid certificate for flight.

The plane landed in the middle of trees on an embankment along the freeway and did not hit any vehicles. The crash did not spark any flames, and narrowly avoided a group of power lines along that side of the road.

""Fortunately it was not on the 210 Freeway, because things would've obviously been a lot worse,"" Los Angeles Police Department Captain James Townsend.

""We did not get any information to tell us that the power lines were involved in the airplane crash,"" said LAFD Deputy Chief Trevor Richmond. ""There wasn't any fire, there was a small fuel leak that was contained by fire resources.""

He continued to note that the crews created a small berm in the immediate location of the leak to prevent it from flowing down onto the freeway.

The crash occurred around four miles north of Whiteman Airport in Pacoima, where it departed from at 12:20 p.m., crashing eight minutes later.

Locals have called for the airport to shut down several times in the past, and most recently in January after a pilot crashed onto the train tracks in the area, where he was barely rescued before his aircraft was struck by an oncoming train.

Pacoima Beautiful is one group hoping to shut down the airport. Teodora Reyes, one of the many locals that make up the non-profit organization, spoke with CBS reporters Wednesday evening, where she detailed that since as of 2020, 75 crashes had been related to Whiteman Airport, according to the NTSB.

Adding the three most recent crashes to happen since 2020, brings that total to 78.

""The concern is for the safety of the most impacted members,"" Reyes said, ""who deal with the noise pollution and fear of an airplane falling on their home in the middle of the night.""

""I just saw that Skymaster fall out of the sky there,"" said an air traffic controller over the airport's radio transmission after the crash. ""He was at 2100 [feet], and then just descended quickly. At first I thought it was a bird but it was actually him going down.""

L.A. City Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez issued a statement following the crash on Wednesday evening, which read:

""Tragically, another life cut short by plane crash, and my heartfelt condolences to the victim's family. Pending confirmation of its departure, the frequency of these incidents should warrant an immediate closure and investigation over the private operations at Whiteman Airport out of respect for the lives of the victims, their families and our community.""

Crews on the scene planned to move the plane from the embankment into an empty field adjacent to the crash site by crane, where NTSB and FAA investigators will work to determine the cause.

Witnesses on the scene detailed the moments during and after the crash occurred.

""All of the sudden you heard like this 'shhh... BOOM,'"" said one woman who rushed to where the plane crashed. ""When we went over there we didn't see smoke. Nothing was on fire.""

Another man who was working at a group home just hundreds of yards from the scene of the crash also ran to the site.

""We heard the boom and boss said, 'There's a plane crash, see if you can help,'"" he told CBS reporters. ""So I ran over there and jumped the fence. There was nothing we could do.""

The two lanes on the westbound 210 Freeway closest to the crash site were closed as investigators surveyed the scene.",NO
572,rd_html,"The teenage boy living in a Windsor Hills youth home was enraged. He broke windows, sprayed a fire extinguisher, flipped a refrigerator over.

Staff at the Wayfinder Family Services facility believed he was drunk or high. One of them brought the boy into a courtyard to calm him down, and a group of teens and staff followed. When one of the boys threw a punch, according to police interviews with witnesses and security camera footage, a counselor who had been hired less than a month earlier intervened. A brawl ensued.

A series of headbutts from a teen left 25-year-old David McKnight-Hillman dizzy and struggling to walk. In what prosecutors would later describe as a “mob attack,” several boys descended on McKnight-Hillman, kicking, punching and stomping on him. By the next morning, McKnight-Hillman was dead from head injuries. Six teens were arrested and charged with murder.

The unrest that fueled the January 2021 melee was not uncommon at Wayfinder.

Staff at the facility call the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department hundreds of times each year for help with violent teens, runaways and other issues, The Times found. When they called repeatedly for help that night, an attorney for Wayfinder said, the staff was told by deputies that they would not respond until the situation resulted in an actual fight. By the time that happened, it was too late.

Former employees say Wayfinder long struggled to curb drug use and protect staff from violent residents. One former employee alleged that two of the teens arrested in McKnight-Hillman’s killing had injured him during an attack a month earlier but were allowed to stay on the grounds.

The persistent trouble at the facility drew concern from state officials worried whether Wayfinder could adequately care for the children Los Angeles County pays it to house and treat.

It also illustrates broader tensions over child-care reforms signed into law in 2017 that established Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Programs like the one Wayfinder was running the night of McKnight-Hillman’s death. Critics say these programs, which house larger numbers of mentally ill and traumatized youths than other types of group homes, pose increased risks to counselors and other staff members.

That concern is reflected in how often sheriff’s deputies were summoned to Wayfinder’s campus, where the nonprofit organization runs multiple programs in separate buildings, including the short-term placement program, a temporary shelter for children in the foster care system and a school for the blind.

Sheriff’s Department figures show it received 600 calls for help from Wayfinder in 2019 and 827 calls in 2020. But three months after McKnight-Hillman’s death, Wayfinder closed its Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program, and calls to the Sheriff’s Department fell sharply to 278 last year.

Wayfinder‘s president, Jay Allen, declined to be interviewed, and a spokeswoman for the county’s Department of Child and Family Services declined to discuss McKnight-Hillman’s death, citing a pending lawsuit from his family. In written responses to questions from The Times, Allen disputed the idea that Wayfinder was unsafe or that the number of times law enforcement was called was unusually high.

“For nearly 70 years, Wayfinder Family Services has provided supportive services to our state’s most vulnerable. Those with disabilities, those without a home of their own, those who have been abused and many, many more,” he said. “Through our longstanding and collaborative partnership with Los Angeles County, Wayfinder provides safe, temporary shelter for children who have been removed from their families due to abuse.”

Records reviewed by The Times contain accounts of myriad assaults and injuries at Wayfinder in recent years. In one incident, a teen suffered first-degree burns, and in another a pregnant staff member was elbowed in the stomach. A staff member also said they were assaulted in a room in 2018 by a group of juveniles while others blocked the door.

Former employees told The Times they often worried they would be physically harmed at work.

“After seeing some of the violence actually take place I would actually say to myself ... ‘Is it actually safe to come to work today?’ ” said C.J. Cormier Dunnick, who quit his job as a counselor in part due to safety concerns.

Dunnick, who left Wayfinder about two months before McKnight-Hillman was killed, said he was not properly trained to de-escalate the frequent violent clashes between residents and said working there was like being “thrown to the wolves.”

“The youth had a lot of power ... dictating what they were going to do, not necessarily what they were supposed to do. Some days it could be very hostile, a youth could be riled up for whatever reason,” Dunnick said. “They pretty much did what they wanted.”

Allen, Wayfinder’s president, said such claims are inaccurate. He pointed to a report by the state’s Department of Social Services that concluded there had been “no deficiencies” in how Wayfinder’s staff handled the fight that led to McKnight-Hillman’s death.

“Wayfinder conducts extensive and substantial training for its staff on de-escalation when children are in distress, trauma and intervention, and must comply with comprehensive licensing and program regulations,” he said. “This is incredibly difficult work. ... We have many successful, long-term employees, but, understandably, this work is not for everyone.”

An attorney for Wayfinder, Manuel Abascal, said in a letter to The Times that despite repeated 911 calls for help on the night of the brawl, sheriff’s deputies told Wayfinder staff they would not respond until things turned violent. At the trial for one of the teens charged in McKnight-Hillman’s death, several former Wayfinder employees made the same claim.

A Sheriff’s Department spokesman said deputies were dispatched to Wayfinder after “the first call for service” that night, but would not say when they arrived on scene.

More than half of Wayfinder’s contacts with police from 2017 to 2020 involved residents leaving the grounds without permission, according to Sheriff’s Department call logs reviewed by The Times. Facilities like Wayfinder are required to notify law enforcement when that happens.

Former Wayfinder employees said runaways contributed to an undercurrent of instability at the facility and often left residents in dangerous situations. One former counselor, who asked not to be identified to protect their future employment prospects, recalled a teen who fled in 2020, got drunk and then called from a McDonald’s parking lot where he had been injured in a fight.

During the investigation into McKnight-Hillman’s killing, a Wayfinder employee told sheriff’s investigators that the facility had a “chronic problem” with kids using drugs on site that they obtained after running away, according to a judge’s summary of testimony delivered during the trial of one of the teens accused of killing McKnight-Hillman.

Allen said he discussed the frequency with which sheriff’s deputies were called to Wayfinder with county officials and that “there was no suggestion that the number or nature of calls was unusual.”

The number of runaways was a cause for concern at the Department of Social Services, the agency which controls licensing for child-care facilities in California. Agency spokesman Scott Murray said Social Services officials met in 2019 with county officials, law enforcement and Wayfinder staff to address “an increased number of runaway youth and the aggressive behaviors of some youth at the facility.”

As a result of those meetings, Wayfinder stopped housing girls in its short-term placement program, reduced the maximum number of youths in the program from 40 to 32 and had its “direct care” staff receive additional training on trauma-informed practices and risk management, Murray said.

Joice Hillman wasn’t surprised her grandson wanted to help troubled kids. He’d always had a “servant’s heart,” she said, that grew from a young age as he helped care for his mother, Monique, who suffered from sickle cell disease. He often talked about wanting to be a social worker or a psychiatrist, she said.

“Money and riches had its place, and I’m not saying he didn’t desire or want nice things, but I think it’s very important to say David, my grandson, I think he wanted to make a difference,” said his grandfather, David Hillman Jr.

After graduating from San Francisco State University in 2019 with a degree in sociology, McKnight-Hillman took a job counseling teenagers with mental health issues in Long Beach, family members said. He was laid off during the pandemic and spent months scrambling for work until he found an opening at Wayfinder, they said.

McKnight-Hillman was hired in December 2020 and was killed after working just 10 shifts, his relatives said. He shared few details with family about his job at Wayfinder, though he did say it was challenging.

When he joined Wayfinder, McKnight-Hillman walked into a much larger debate playing out across the state over the use of short-term residential programs. The model, implemented in 2017 after the passage of a state Assembly bill, was intended to improve access to mental health services for youths in the foster system and to create more uniform standards for facilities.

But it also often resulted in an increase in the number of youths housed under one roof. Concentrating larger numbers of mentally ill or traumatized youths in the same space, critics said, creates an environment that endangers staff while failing to meet the needs of the kids they are assigned to care for.

An L.A. County task force report issued last year determined that children housed in programs like the one at Wayfinder did not have access to enough “engaging activities,” leading to increased aggressive behavior. Housing teens together who had experienced different types of trauma, including sexual abuse, abandonment and gang involvement, amounted to a one size fits all approach that left staff struggling to offer meaningful help, the report found.

“We told the state, if you’re moving to the [short-term program] model, the number of runaways will go up, the number of incidents will go up. You’re creating this pressure-cooker situation,” said Jodi Kurata, executive director of the Assn. Of Community Human Service Agencies, which advocates for dozens of child-care facilities in L.A. County.

The county’s Department of Child and Family Services and its Probation Department currently have contracts with 29 nonprofit organizations operating short-term residential therapeutic programs at about 72 sites housing nearly 330 children, said Shiara Davila-Morales, a DCFS spokeswoman.

Some of the county task force report’s findings mirrored those of a 2019 survey of 47 programs similar to Wayfinder conducted by the California Alliance Of Child & Family Services. In the nearly three years after the state-mandated reforms went into effect, the providers reported a 56% increase in the number of runaways, a 47% rise in physical assaults between youths, a 38% increase in property damage and an 11% increase in assaults on staff, compared with the years before the switch.

At a trial for one of the teens charged in the killing, L.A. County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria Marin said McKnight-Hillman suffered the most serious injuries when he was head-butted and described what happened to him as a “mob attack.”

An autopsy concluded McKnight-Hillman suffered a “subgaleal hemorrhage” to the back of his head, and the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma.

Of the six teens arrested, Nyier Mason and Keith Lewis were charged with murder as adults because they were 18 at the time. Four younger boys were charged in juvenile court.

Lewis was later cleared of all charges after video of the brawl showed he was a “passive bystander” to the attack, court records show.

“Two staff members said, inappropriately, that everybody out there was physically participating in that beating … and that just wasn’t true,” said Lewis’ attorney, Kevin Greber. “The training of the staff was very underwhelming.”

Allen, Wayfinder’s president, said Greber’s description of his employees’ behavior was inaccurate but declined to elaborate, citing the pending lawsuit.

In August, the murder charge against the second adult in the case, Mason, was reduced to assault as part of a plea deal, and he was sentenced to probation, court records show.

Two of the juvenile defendants pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and a third had his case dismissed after he was found mentally incompetent, according to Greg Risling, a spokesman for the district attorney’s office. A fourth defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter last month and sentenced to six years in juvenile hall.

Though it continues to run a youth shelter and provide services for children with physical disabilities, Wayfinder, three months after McKnight-Hillman’s death, shut down the short-term residential program where he had worked.

Questions about what Wayfinder could have done to prevent the tragedy remain.

Security officers did not intervene on the night of the killing. Allen said he believed guards are not allowed to physically touch residents, but Murray, the spokesman for the Department of Social Services, said state policies do not bar them from doing so. Told of Murray’s comments, Allen said he stood by his interpretation of state licensing standards.

In interviews, three former Wayfinder employees repeatedly expressed frustration that security guards failed to keep them safe, and the L.A. County report recommended that security guards be given the authority to directly intervene in fights and other incidents.

Two of the juvenile defendants in McKnight-Hillman’s killing had been accused of attacking Wayfinder employees a month earlier. Rasheed Phillips, a former counselor at the facility’s transitional housing shelter, said staff members were attacked and harassed by the two teens multiple times during a three-hour span in early December 2020.

Phillips, 45, said he called the Sheriff’s Department after two youths struck a staff member. Deputies responded and issued citations for battery against two juveniles, one of whom would later be accused of killing McKnight-Hillman, Phillips said.

Less than an hour later, Phillips said, he entered the building that housed the short-term residential program to remove girls who were supposed to be in the campus’ shelter that he oversaw. Once inside, he said, he was attacked by a group of teens. Phillips said he was punched, knocked to the ground and kicked in the ribs. At some point in the struggle, he suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon.

In interview transcripts reviewed by The Times and in court by L.A. County Superior Court Judge Christopher Smith, the teens identified by Phillips were named as being among those who attacked McKnight-Hillman. One of the teens Phillips accused of attacking him was the person who head-butted McKnight-Hillman, according to the transcripts and Smith.

Phillips faulted Wayfinder officials for not having the teens removed and placed by the county in another facility, saying he found them “100% responsible” for McKnight-Hillman’s death.

Allen said the facility “took all appropriate steps” after the attack on Phillips, including trying to get the teens removed, but he declined to discuss specifics because the incident involved minors. If a notice of removal was issued, it would have been the responsibility of the Department of Child and Family Services to transfer the teens to another program.

Davila-Morales, the DCFS spokeswoman, said she could not comment on Phillips’ or Wayfinder’s claims, due to the pending civil suit. She did say that even with a removal order, a county social worker or staff member at a residential program “cannot force children or youth to move to a new placement.”

Law enforcement can be called in as a “last resort” if someone is deemed to be a significant public safety threat, she said.

Leslie Heimov, head of the Children’s Law Center of California, which represents abused youths, said McKnight-Hillman’s death and the high number of incidents at Wayfinder should be a warning to providers throughout the state.

“I think what you’re seeing should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. It’s not a problem that was limited to Wayfinder,” she said. “No child should live in a place where that’s happening every day.”",NO

1257,gs_html,"San Diego, CA (September 10, 2020) – On Wednesday, Kiana Taylor, 22, and passenger Casey Diane Hargis, 22, died in a fiery vehicle crash.

 

 The incident occurred on El Cajon Boulevard at 70th Street.

 

 Moreover, San Diego Police officer John Buttle said the accident happened at around 9:10 PM.

 

 According to authorities, a 63-year-old 2016 Mercedes E400 driver suffering a medical problem ran a red light in the Rolando area. Therefore, this caused a five-vehicle collision that sent six people to the hospital.

 

 Thus, Ms. Taylor and her 22-year-old passenger, Ms. Hargis, sustained serious injuries in the pileup.

 

 They had been preparing to turn left onto 70th Street.

 

 Then, the driver with medical issue struck their 2015 Ford Fusion from behind on eastbound El Cajon Boulevard.

 

 Subsequently, the impact pushed both vehicles into the westbound lanes, where they were struck by three other vehicles — a Nissan Rogue SUV, a BMW, and a Honda Civic.

 

 As a result of the crash, the Ford started a fire. Two women were trapped inside the Ford before witnesses pulled them from the car.

 

 Moreover, Buttle said both women suffered second and third-degree burns over 70 percent of their bodies. They also sustained uncontrolled internal bleeding.

 

 Immediately, the rescuers took them to a hospital for treatment of their injuries.

 

 UCSD Medical Center medics pronounced Casey Hargis dead in the early morning on Thursday. Furthermore, the next day on September 11th, Kiana Taylor’s death was announced.

 

 Officer Tony Martinez said the Mercedes driver was rushed to a hospital for treatment of unknown injuries.

 

 Buttle added that the rescuers also rushed the 20-year-old Nissan driver, the 63-year-old BMW driver, and the 20-year-old Honda driver to local hospitals for treatment of minor injuries.

With heavy hearts, we send our condolences to the family and friends of Kiana Taylor and Casey Diane Hargis.

UFC veteran Tony Ferguson was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence early Sunday after his truck struck other vehicles and rolled over in Hollywood, police said.

Ferguson, a former interim lightweight champion for the Ultimate Fighting Champtionship, was driving south on Wilcox Avenue around 1:47 a.m. when his Silverado hit at least two other vehicles and flipped over near Sunset Boulevard, the Los Angeles Police Department said.

Ferguson had passengers with him, but no injuries were reported, LAPD Officer Norma Eisenman said.

She said Ferguson allegedly refused to take a breathalyzer test at the scene and was later arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.

The UFC fighter spent part of his childhood in Oxnard before moving to Michigan, where he worked with his stepfather renovating homes for the family’s contractor business. An all-around athlete, Ferguson was an elite high school wrestler and also played baseball and football. He returned to Southern California in 2008 to train in martial arts.

He has said those life experiences contributed to his success as a fighter.

“You know what it was that I took from all that? Not quitting,” Ferguson told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. “I learned how to finesse. Finesse is catching the baseball on the edge of your glove when you’re turning two, making the one-handed grabs and shoestring tackles by running across the field in football. And finesse is what I bring to fighting.”",NO

A driver with four prior DUI convictions was again arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence on Tuesday after he struck and killed a pedestrian in Orange.
The crash happened at around 11:20 a.m. as the pedestrian crossed N. Tustin Street near Palm Avenue outside of a marked crosswalk, according to Orange Police Department officers.
Paramedics pronounced the victim, who has not yet been identified, dead at the scene.
About 10 minutes after the fatal incident, an OPD detective spotted the suspect's Toyota driving near Glassell Street and Katella Avenue with significant damage to the front end.
A brief pursuit ensued before the suspect, who has been identified as 31-year-old Jonathan Lopez, came to a stop at Tustin Street and Adams Avenue.
""Lopez displayed objective signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication and was arrested for felony DUI, felony hit and run, evading, and vehicular homicide,"" said a statement from OPD. ""Lopez has four prior convictions of DUI in the last 10 years.""
Video from the scene of the arrest shows Lopez as he appears to drink something inside of his damaged car, just moments before he's surrounded by officers.
Police say that Lopez was not legally allowed to be behind the wheel of the car at the time of the crash, and that he had a warrant out for his arrest for driving without a license.
""A DUI driver that has shown that he will continue to drink and drive and drive without a license and be a danger to everyone out there on the road,"" said Orange Police Lieutenant Phil McMullin. ""it's frustrating, but we continue to do what we can for enforcement.""
Jail records show that Lopez previously pleaded guilty to felony drunk driving and a misdemeanor for driving on a suspended or revoked license in Dec. 2021.
As part of the plea deal at the time, two misdemeanor counts of child abuse and endangerment for two boys that were in the car were dropped. He was sentenced to 16 months in jail..
At the same time, Lopez also settled a separate criminal case with a guilty plea to misdemeanor driving on a suspended or revoked license due to a prior DUI, as well as infractions for child seats in the car and for using a phone while driving.
In May 2018, Lopez pleaded guilty to misdemeanor hit-and-run with property damage and driving on a suspended or revoked license.
He also pleaded guilty to drunk driving in Oct. 2011, April 2012 and Sept. 2015, court records show.
Lopez was charged with second-degree murder on Thursday, as well as leading police on a chase, hit-and-run with permanent injury, driving under the influence of alcohol causing injury and driving under the influence with a blood-alcohol content in excess of the legal limit causing injury, all of which are felonies.
He also faces sentencing enhancements for inflicting great bodily injury and was charged with a misdemeanor count of driving on a revoked license.
He did not enter a plea at the arraignment and is being held without bail. His arraignment has been rescheduled for March 29.",NO
829,rd_url,"Tudor home on Irving had nearly a score of owners
Most houses in our neighborhood have had a few owners since they were built in that ambitious age of the 1920s when Windsor Square, Hancock Park and environs came to be. Some houses have been handed down through families, and some have had a few more owners than others.
The house that I lived in at 144 N. Norton had six previous owners when I purchased it in 1988. Corner properties are sometimes more transient than others depending upon the location. For instance, the northwest corner of Third St. and Wilton Pl. has had many owners and was an eyesore for years until property values increased and a preservation-conscious couple purchased it. They restored it and continue to think of ways to drown out the busy rush hour traffic outside.
The house at 555 S. Irving Blvd. has had a whopping 19 owners prior to the current occupants. Located on the northwest corner of Sixth St. and Irving, just across from the mayoral Getty House, the large brick Tudor has a slate roof. It has six bedrooms and six bathrooms, a butler’s pantry, back staircase, screened porch, crown moldings, fireplaces in both dining room and living room and is on a large stately lot.
This home has had an interesting selection of people occupying it since it was first built by Harry Belden in 1924. The list of names attached to the property reflects the evolution of our neighborhood as it does the cultural melting pot of our nation. Because of space constraints, we will focus on only a few owners.
Harry Belden
Belden was a contractor who built many homes around Los Angeles. According to the periodical “Domestic Engineering-The Plumbing and Heating Weekly,” February 11, 1922, “Harry H. Belden has purchased 12 lots on Lorraine Boulevard between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and will erect residences on each lot costing from $25,000 to $30,000 each.”
Shatto and Catalina Island
From the Beldens, the property moved into the hands of an icon of early Los Angeles real estate development history. Clara Shatto was a widow for many years when she purchased the Irving property in 1927. She and her husband, George Rufus Shatto, moved west to California during the 1880s land boom.
Among other things, George thought it would be a great idea to buy a worthless piece of land offshore. Purchased for between $150,000 and $200,000, Shatto briefly owned Santa Catalina Island. He developed the town of Avalon there.
Clara and George had one child, Walter, who sadly died eight months after birth. The ambitious George was killed at the age of 42 in a freight train accident in 1893.
Clara Shatto later donated 32 acres of land along Wilshire Blvd. to the city of Los Angeles. Today, that land is Lafayette Park. She is buried at Rosedale Cemetery in the large, private Shatto Mausoleum that is shaped like a pyramid.
Seventeen more owners
Clara Shatto only lived at the Irving house a short time before selling it to Cyrus and Amelia Boon (1928-1930). From them, the chain of title is: Charles and Sadie Andrews (1930-1937), Fred Andrews (April 1937 – June 1937), back to Charles and Sadie Andrews (1937-1943), Ruby L. Baker (1943-1972), Lucille C. Bolin (1972-1978), Fred and Nevelyn Ervin (1978), Don O. Pettie (1978-1979), Nagi and Maureen Murad (1979-1990), Jun Li Kang (1990-1991), Michelle Kim (1991-1992), Andrea H. Im (1992-1993), Kyung Mun and Ok Sun Kim (1993-1995), Jun Il Kang (1995-1996), Coast Federal Bank (1996), Richard Ahn and Erica Kim (1996-1999), Erica Kim (1999-2003), Caroline Labiner Moser and Dr. Franklin G. Moser.
Labiner-Moser Years
Dr. Moser is the director of clinical and interventional neuroradiology at Cedars-Sinai, and his wife is an architect. She serves on the Park Mile Design Review Board, the Windsor Square and Harvard Heights HPOZ Boards and the Greater Wilshire Neighborhood Council and Bel Air – Beverly Crest Neighborhood Council land use committees. She is a board member of the Windsor Square Association and of the Natural History Museum. Their two grown daughters graduated from Marlborough School and Cornell University.
In moving to 555 S. Irving, Caroline had to undo some of the inappropriate additions from years of different ownership. She did so with skill and taste.
It is wonderful to have this historic house back in the hands of people who intend to be there a long time, maybe as long as Ruby Baker, who enjoyed the house for nearly 30 of its nearly 100 years.

Author Tim Z. Hernandez was digging through old newspapers at the Fresno County library when a dramatic headline from the late 1940s captured his attention.“I stumbled upon this headline that said, ‘100 people see a ship plunge to the earth’ or something like that. It was just really a captivating headline. I instantly realized after reading it that it had to be tied into Woody Guthrie’s song,” says Hernandez. 


The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon/A fireball of lightning, and shook all our hills/Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves?/ The radio says, “They are just deportees.”




That song is called ‘Deportee.’ The folk musician wrote the lyrics after hearing of a harrowing plane crash that occurred in Fresno County in 1948.The plane, chartered by the U.S. Immigration Service, was transporting 28 Mexican nationals from Oakland to El Centro, near the U.S.-Mexican border.The plane's wing caught fire and broke off, scattering body parts through Los Gatos Canyon near Coalinga.W.L. Childers, who lived on a ranch in the canyon, witnessed the crash and its aftermath. His quote ran in the Fresno Bee in 1948.“The plane was headed east about a mile high. I was watching it when I noticed a streak of smoke trailing off the left motor. The left wing then separated from the body of the plane and the fuselage and the right wing began to spiral down toward the earth. As I watched, I could see bodies separating from the wreckage as they either jumped or were thrown clear,” said Childers.All 32 onboard, including the flight crew and an immigration officer, died.The crash made national news. But the names of the victims did not. Locally, the Fresno Bee published some names. But an Associated Press article that ran in the New York Times the day after the crash only named the crew. It simply referred to the passengers as “28 Mexican deportees.”That angered Guthrie, and inspired his song. In it, he assigned symbolic names to the victims. It’s performed here by his son, Arlo Guthrie.


Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita/Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria; You won’t have your names when you ride the big airplane/All they will call you will be “deportees.”




As Hernandez reflected on the news accounts of the tragedy and the song lyrics, he instantly knew he had another book idea.“Being in that sort of mindset, and looking at these 28 lives that had perished in this plane crash in 1948, and didn’t have the dignity of their names afforded to them in the media at the time, was something that I think just felt compelled to want to find their story or put their story back,” says Hernandez.“That's really was captured my attention. How can I not only find their names, maybe, but also give them their story back, to some degree?”For Hernandez, piecing the story back together – 65 years later – has become a multi-year journey. His goal is to reconstruct the accident, and the lives of the people impacted by it.“For me, that’s what the book is about. It’s about capturing the ripple effect of all the lives that this one tragedy touched, back then and even today,” says Hernandez.That journey took him to the site of the crash. It’s located in a quiet, lush canyon.“It’s nice here. It’s like someone’s backyard, it’s very pretty, it’s a cattle field right now, we had to step over the cow pies on the way out here. It’s very nice, pine trees, canyon, creek right here, but it’s a very famous crash site right here, also.” says Coalinga resident Larry Haws. His mother was just a child when she saw the wing of the plane fall off, and land just steps from her grandmother’s home. He, of course, didn’t witness the crash, but he was willing to show me where it happened. We climbed under some barbed wire and walked through a field to reach the site, which today is unmarked.“The plane came in, and barely made it over this little ridge we see right here to our right, and it was spiraling, and it barely made it over that, and it crashed head on into this creek bank, right here, and it caught these three trees on fire.”Hernandez also connected with Haws’ aunt, June Leigh Austin, who was almost 10 years old when the plane crashed near her home in the canyon.“I didn’t see the plane go down, although several members of my family did. I arrived there on the school bus, after it was down and they were still pulling the bodies out, and all the things were happening,” says Austin.She recalls that parts of the passenger’s bodies were strewn across the canyon.


%22There%20were%20bodies%20scattered%20all%20over%2C%20so%20it%20took%20a%20lot%20to%20even%20find%20everybody%2C%20all%20the%20pieces%20I%20should%20say.%20I%20don%27t%20know%20that%20there%20were%20any%20bodies%20totally%20intact%2C%20and%20none%20were%20identified.%20There%20were%20mainly%20just%20bits%20and%20pieces.%22%20-%20June%20Leigh%20Austin




“There were bodies scattered all over, so it took a lot to even find everybody, all the pieces I should say. I don’t know that there were any bodies totally intact, and none were identified. There were mainly just bits and pieces,” says Austin.Austin, who is 74, remembers the incident like it was yesterday.“It was a horrendous thing and I don’t know if it was worse on me as a child or not, but it certainly stayed with me all my life. The sight and the smell, and everything that happened, it affected all of our family,” says Austin.


We died in your hills, we died in your deserts/We died in your valleys and died in your plains. / We died ‘neath your trees and we died in your bushes/Both sides of the river, we died just the same.




But Hernandez says a major component of this story is still missing.Hernandez combed through records to properly identify, as best he could, the 28 Mexicans who died in the crash. He recites the names in this version of ‘Deportee,’ which he recorded with Fresno musician Lance Canales.He has learned a little about them: He’s determined that some were braceros, or guest agricultural workers.  One person, he says, had a laundry workers union card in his back pocket. Another worked in a foundry in Sacramento.“What I don’t have, though, still, at the end of the day, are the voices of the 28 people who died on board,” says Hernandez.“Virtually nothing, about how to locate the surviving families of these plane crash victims – 28 deportees, or Mexican nationals. That’s why I feel like, right now, I’m not satisfied with moving forward with this book at this point, until I feel like I’ve exhausted every resource to find that family,” says Hernandez.That’s where this historical event becomes a modern-day, community endeavor.Rebecca Plevin: “If you were reaching out to those families, what would the message be?” Tim Hernandez : “Uh, call me!” (Laughs.) Hernandez acknowledges that any survivors of the crash victims could be several generations removed. But if a grandchild, or great-grandchild, or a survivor has even a photo of one of the victims, that would make a difference.“Sometimes, just seeing a photograph can speak volumes, as we all know. Even that would be something, putting a face to their names.  It’s going beyond a step beyond just their names,” says Hernandez. There’s another way that Hernandez is breathing new life into this story and its characters.He learned that the 28 Mexican citizens were buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Fresno. Their graves are marked with one headstone.“It’s a 12 by 24 bronze memorial, as you can see, it’s weathered, it’s patina-ed. It says, ’28 Mexican citizens who died in an airplane accident near Coalinga, California, on January 28, 1948,” says Carlos Rascon. He is the director of cemeteries for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno. He, like Guthrie and then Hernandez, was moved to learn that the 28 people were buried, without their names inscribed on a headstone.“There are people that are buried here that are John Does, Jane Does. And if you had a family member that went missing, and later on you find out that they’re actually at a cemetery and they have no names, that would strike me as – why, why isn’t their names there? It’s unsettling to me, it’s almost like it’s unfinished,” says Rascon.Rascon and Hernandez came up with a plan. They are raising $10,000 to establish a memorial to the victims of the plane crash. The memorial will include the names of each of the 28 Mexican citizens.“My idea, as part of the inscription, is to have one leaf represent each of the 32 people. 28 of them are here, but the other four were buried elsewhere. And if you hear Woody Guthrie’s poem, it says, ‘they were scattered like dry leaves on our topsoil,” says Rascon.


Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?/Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit? To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil/And be called by no name except “deportees?”




Hernandez encourages people to embrace this part of our history.“We want the community to feel that this is part of their history as well, not just California history, but American history, as Woody Guthrie told us. At the end of the day, our names are really what we have,” says Hernandez.

8,np_url,"Passengers aboard an Altamont Corridor Express train traveling westbound near Sunol on Tuesday had to be evacuated after a 100-foot mudslide blocked the tracks.

Alameda County Fire Department Division Chief Randall West told KTVU that the train, carrying 230 passengers and crew, did not derail at 8:45 a.m., and there were no injuries or equipment damaged by the mudslide.

Essentially, the train was stopped on its track because of the mud.

A passenger took video from inside the train, showing tree branches that had fallen outside cracked train windows.

Union Pacific crews were sent to inspect the tracks and work to get them cleared.

""It was more like a shock. But it was very short. So we just moved for a second and then stop,"" said passenger Fatima Racilli.

The train started off in Stockton at 6:50 a.m. and had been bound for San Jose.

At around noon, a second train was sent to retrieve the passengers by coupling the two trains together and pulling the stalled one to the Pleasanton station.

""At that point, ACE 05 became unable to progress on its route. At which time Union Pacific was notified and dispatched a crew to clean up the tracks,"" said David Lipari, a spokesman for the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission.

Experts said weeks of heavy rain was likely a contributing factor for the accident.

""When the trains go by, they cause vibrations in the ground. And that combination of water-loosened soil can in some circumstances, lead t to a mudslide,"" said Dr. Frannie Edwards of the Mineta Transportation Institute.

Photos courtesy Alameda County Fire Department.

Officials said there was minimal train damage, and no injuries to passengers and crew due to built-in safety features.

""The train itself performed as it was designed. The Lexan windows were hit by a lot of shrubbery and vegetation, but they did not shatter,"" said Edwards.

Once the transfer of passengers was completed, the second train reversed course – backing along the tracks back to the Pleasanton Station.

Passengers were off loaded, and moved to buses to complete the trip to San Jose.

""This is a better situation than driving to work in Silicon Valley every day. I’ll continue to ride the train,"" said one passenger, who missed a day at work due to the delay.

The train is expected to be restored Wednesday morning.

The mudslide also disrupted travel for passengers headed from San Jose to the Central Valley, as their northbound service was stuck behind mud and metal.

ACE Transit officials said the three Capitol Corridor trains headed from San Jose to the East Bay Tuesday night would honor ACE Transit tickets.

Bicycle Accident Statistics
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were 783 bicyclists killed in traffic accidents in 2018. This is a 2% decrease from the previous year, but it is still a significant number of fatalities.
While many believe careless drivers primarily cause bicycle accidents, this is not always the case. Bicyclists themselves are often responsible for their own casualties. One study found that distracted biking, such as riding while texting or listening to music, was a factor in nearly one-third of all accidents.
Other common causes of bicycle accidents include riding at night without lights, riding under the influence of alcohol, and failing to yield the right of way. By understanding the risks associated with biking, bicyclists and drivers can help reduce the number of road accidents.

A Union Pacific (UP) freight train traveling south through Madera collided with a pickup on Thursday, June 28, at about 10:30am. 
A couple on vacation in their motor home, towing the pickup behind, were crossing the UP tracks west bound on Clevelend Avenue when the motor home died. The driver made several attempts to re-start the motor home without success. The motor home itself was clear of the tracks, however the pickup truck was still sitting in the middle of the crossing. 
The driver’s wife noticed a south bound freight train approaching the crossing. Realizing that they could not move the vehicle off the tracks, they both abandoned the motor home, watching in horror as the train struck the pickup. The force of the impact ripped the pickup from the tow bar of the motor home and shoved it some 3,000 feet down the track before the train was able to come to a stop.

Fortunately, no one was injured in the accident. There was no damage to the tracks or the locomotive, though the pickup was completely destroyed.
Emergency responders included the Madera City Police Department, Madera City Fire Department and officials from the Union Pacific railroad. After the pickup was removed from the lead locomotive, UP personnel inspected the train and track for damage. The train was released after a two hour delay.

This year’s leadup to the Run for the Roses was especially painful, as one horse that had earned a starting spot broke down during training and was euthanized.

Wild on Ice, the long-shot winner of the Sunland Derby, was pulled up on the backstretch Thursday with an injury to his left hind leg. He walked on to the horse ambulance, was evaluated at Churchill Downs and then was transferred to an equine hospital in Lexington, Ky., where it was determined that the gelding’s injuries were not repairable.

Kentucky, unlike California and New York, shows little transparency when it comes to horse injuries. So, word of the horse’s death was announced by a reporter with the El Paso (Texas) Times after being told by the horse’s owner, Frank Sumpter. Churchill Downs only has acknowledged that the horse was injured and will not run.

In the 148 runnings of the Kentucky Derby, just one horse, Eight Belles in 2008, has died as part of the race. The filly broke both front ankles after crossing the finish line in second place and was euthanized on the track. As for how many horses have died training for the Derby, there are no records.

A strong wind gust could have turned an ordinary day into a tragedy had a quick-thinking good Samaritan not been nearby.

Surveillance video outside a California business shows a stroller with a baby inside being blown toward a busy roadway as the baby's caregiver loads up a parked car.

The caregiver is seen tripping and falling to the ground as she runs toward the moving stroller, which is stopped by a man nearby just before it rolls onto the street.

The incident happened in front of the A1 Carwash on Bear Valley Road in Hesperia, California, on Tuesday afternoon, the man, Ronald Nessman, told ABC Los Angeles Station KABC.

Nessman and his sister happened to be at the right place at the right time, he said. He had just completed a job interview at the nearby Applebee's, and the pair decided to get a car wash.

As the stroller rolled backwards toward the heavy traffic, Nessman sprung into action, he said.

""The wind was blowing so hard, by the time I got to it, it was at the top of that driveway,"" he said. ""I noticed the stroller was going toward traffic. I instinctively ran toward the stroller and got it before it went into traffic.""

After Nessman grabbed the stroller, he is seen walking toward the caregiver and comforting her as she struggled to stand up after the hard fall.

The woman was ""traumatized,"" Nessman said.

""She was crying,"" he said. ""She was just in shock. That's why I gave her a hug.""

While Nessman is being hailed a hero, he simply hopes his good deed is a sign of a better future ahead. Once homeless, Nessman moved in with his sister and is currently looking for a job, he said.

984,gs_html,"‘Why did you build such a small train?’ That was the frequent refrain facing Stefan Rosendahl and his Stadler colleagues as visitors to the InnoTrans trade show in Berlin got a first look at the new offering for Glasgow’s underground. Many visitors to the show, unfamiliar with the Subway’s unique four-foot track gauge and 3.4-metre tunnel diameter, were perplexed to find a train they could not stand up straight in.

This was a true debut outing – no-one had seen the new Subway train before. Mr Rosendahl, Senior Project Manager for the Swiss manufacturer, says the train was completed only two weeks prior to the show. But, with the debut outing promised, he says everyone at Stadler was fully geared up to ensure that deadline would be met. And Mr Rosendahl affirms that the Subway train is indeed both unique and special, while highlighting his deep respect for the previous generation of engineers who built the current stock.

The contract to build the new Subway fleet was awarded in March 2016. Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, which operates the Subway, opted to procure trains and signalling as a single package, with a £200 million deal awarded to a joint venture of Ansaldo STS and Stadler. Stadler will supply 17 new trains to replace the current fleet, which mostly dates from the late 1970s, while Ansaldo STS will be responsible for a new signalling system, telecoms and control centre. This is planned to facilitate a move to unattended train operation, with the Subway becoming the first system in the UK to operate routinely without any staff on board its trains.

With the joint venture in mind, Mr Rosendahl says integration of the new trains with the control system is a key interface. He highlights the importance of Stadler and Ansaldo STS knowing each other’s requirements and of commissioning systems together. As well as the new control system, Ansaldo STS will be responsible for fitting half-height platform screen doors, again requiring strong co-operation with the rolling stock manufacturer. At the same time, throughout the design process Stadler engaged with its customer, SPT, on refinements to the look and characteristics of the new trains.

So with this being a unique project, what were the key challenges of designing the new Subway train? ‘Usually when we are going through the design phase and talking about tolerances they are in centimetres, but here we are really talking about millimetres’ Stefan Rosendahl explains. Most of the 24-volt equipment is contained beneath seat bases, with higher-voltage equipment under the vehicle floors. ‘We have a lot of cabling on this train – around 15km on a 39-metre-long train, most of which is under the floor in a specially designed cable duct’ Mr Rosendahl adds.

The current Subway trains run in three-car formations, but Stadler is replacing them with four-car units, formed of two articulated pairs. Mr Rosendahl explains these pairs of two cars each are more or less identical; indeed, in the interior there is no difference between them, but in the centre of the train there is a key difference in equipment beneath the vehicle floor; one half contains a battery used to power on-board systems while the other features equipment for the Ansaldo STS control system.

FOUR CARS NOT THREE

So why build a four-car unit, not a three-car one as is currently the case? Mr Rosendahl explains this is linked to the requirement in the specification for the new fleet to incorporate through gangways between the vehicles. This drove the decision to have two longer outer vehicles of 12.1 metres each, with the inner vehicles shorter at 7.5 metres.

‘The movements between the carriages are very intensive’ Mr Rosendahl says. ‘For an articulated vehicle you are working in terms of two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional movement. Having two shorter vehicles in the centre of the train reduces the movement on the gangways.’

Another feature of the Glasgow Subway is some notoriously tight curves – of 130-metre radius on the system itself but down to 50 metres within Broomloan depot. Mr Rosendahl says noise and comfort will be improved on the new fleet as a result of the four-car arrangement, as well as the incorporation of rubber elements in the wheels and the trains having air suspension.

Possibly the greatest test of this last characteristic will come from the Glasgow Rangers football fans who board trains at Ibrox after matches. They are known to test the trains’ suspension in a self-explanatory practice known as ‘bouncy bouncy’, certainly a unique challenge for any manufacturer to deal with!

Each train is powered by eight 103kW engines distributed throughout the formation. This should improve performance compared to the current fleet, although the tight curves of the Subway mean the impact on journey times will be marginal.

In terms of the interior, SPT was clear it wanted to retain orange poles and handrails, in homage to the system’s ‘Clockwork Orange’ nickname. The seating moquette is also a nod to the Subway’s heritage, with the concentric circles representing the inner and outer circles, again with suitable splashes of orange.

A new feature is the provision of electronic passenger information displays within the saloons. There are two at each vehicle end – Mr Rosendahl says the intention is for one to display route information such as the next station, and the other to be used for special messages or advertising. However, he says SPT can configure these screens as required, for example by using both screens to display emergency information.

Other on-board features include spaces for wheelchairs and pushchairs (although only two of the Subway’s 15 stations are fully accessible) and CCTV. Each train has six doors per side, as on the current fleet, to facilitate rapid boarding and alighting; the spacing of doors is also similar to that on the current fleet.

The system’s limited gauge means providing air conditioning on the new trains was not practical. However, Mr Rosendahl notes the Subway’s tunnels maintain an ambient temperature of between 16 and 19 degrees, cooler than typically found on other metro systems.

As with many projects, Stadler is utilising multiple sites to produce the new Subway trains. Main construction is at the Altenrhein plant in Switzerland, but bogies come from the sister site at Bussnang.

Mr Rosendahl reports that the train on display at InnoTrans is the only one built so far, with Stadler using experience from the maiden unit to aid construction going forward. After a pause, construction of the second train is now underway.

Once the third train is built there will be a further pause in production. This is because the first three of the 17 trains are to be used for type testing of all features needed for a safe, fully automated operation. As there is no suitable site with the Subway’s unique track gauge on the continent, this must by necessity take place in the UK, and an old test track on land owned by SPT behind Broomloan depot is to be revived for this purpose.

Mr Rosendahl explains two test tracks will be built, one of 150 metres and the other of 750 metres. The former will be used for straightforward dynamic running (to put this length in context, a single circuit of the Subway is 10.6km). The first train must accumulate 2,000 miles of fault-free running, with subsequent units needing to achieve 500 miles.

The longer circuit will be used to test the interfaces with the new Ansaldo systems, such as the new signalling and platform screen doors. With three trains available for the testing process, two can typically be on the test tracks while a third will undergo static testing. The whole testing process is expected to take around two years.

Mr Rosendahl says the first train is due to arrive in the UK by the end of the year; delivery will be by road, half a train at a time.

Trains on the Subway are already driven automatically, but with a driver opening and closing the doors from the cab at the front; this is GoA 2 in the scale of Grades of Automation (see box) and is similar to the methods employed on London Underground lines which use automatic operation. GoA 3 is akin to current Docklands Light Railway operation, where trains are driven automatically but a train captain is located in the passenger saloons rather than in a cab. Moving to GoA 4, where all functions are completely unattended, will be a first for the UK. It is also the first time Stadler has built trains for a driverless system.

Rather than retrofitting the existing signalling system to the new trains, the new Ansaldo signalling will operate in parallel with the current equipment while both the new and old fleets are in service. The challenge here is that both the new trains and signalling must work together from the start, reinforcing Mr Rosendahl’s statement about the importance of the joint venture partners working together. Once the full fleet is in place, the legacy system can be eliminated and the migration phase to full automation, with installation of platform screen doors, can begin.

GoA 3 Driverless train operation (DTO, attendant on board but not necessarily in the cab)

GoA 4 Unattended train operation (UTO, no driver or attendant required for normal operation)

Full automation removes the need for a driver’s cab, but clearly this will still be required in the initial stages.

The train displayed at InnoTrans showcased a temporary cab at one end but none at the other, giving a glimpse of how trains will look through both phases of the migration. Even when the temporary cabs are removed, controls will still be required for manual driving within the depot, and these are contained beneath a seat at the end of the train.

Mr Rosendahl explains a notable change compared to the original specification has been improvement in the temporary cab, including provision of a full driver’s seat. A glass partition wall will be fixed to handrails within the train to segregate the temporary cab from the passenger saloon; Mr Rosendahl says it will take around two days to install or remove this.

The move to full automation has had several interesting implications. One is the precise maximum speed of the trains – 58km/h. Mr Rosendahl explains in any system there is a need to add a tolerance to allow for error, but in the case of fully automatic operation this is higher than in manual mode and is based on a worst-case scenario.

In another first for Stadler, more stringent fire protection standards must be adhered to where fully automatic operation is concerned. Mr Rosendahl says the choice of materials is of prime importance here, highlighting a particular challenge in selecting materials for the floor and seat fabric. On a related point, the seats are from Transcal, an example of Stadler endeavouring to use UK suppliers where possible.

As is normal for an underground metro, safety dictates evacuation must be possible through the cab in the event of an emergency (or, where there is no temporary cab, through the end of the saloon). Beyond the emergency door there is a step and handrail; Mr Rosendahl says the door is released automatically by the Ansaldo control system when required. The normal method of evacuation is to bring a second train alongside and create a closed gangway from one unit to another, with trains able to couple together in degraded mode, although Mr Rosendahl says the design accounts for all eventualities.

SPT will continue to be responsible for maintenance of the new fleet, but with support from Stadler. Mr Rosendahl explains development of the required knowledge will be based on a ‘train the trainer’ philosophy, in co-operation with Ansaldo STS. Like most modern trains, the new Subway vehicles are software-reliant, and SPT staff will need to adapt to the far more advanced diagnostic system for resolving issues on the new fleet.

At present 12 trains are rostered for Subway operation at peak hours (based on 36 out of 41 carriages forming 12 three-car trains). With the new fleet this will rise to a maximum of 16, enabling SPT to increase the frequency of trains to every three minutes at the busiest times. Mr Rosendahl says such levels of availability are regularly achieved with other fleets.

The Subway’s Broomloan depot is being upgraded to accommodate the new fleet, including an extension to the stabling shed, provision of a new train wash, a new lifting road and a wheel lathe; presently wheelsets are sent to Wabtec’s Kilmarnock facility for turning",NO

Richard Turner (Full Name: Richard Alexander Turner), Former Athletic Trainer For Two High Schools In San Fernando Valley, Pleaded No Contest To Felony Charges of Sexually Assaulting Teen Girls

VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA (May 14, 2024) – A former athletic trainer identified as Richard Turner has pleaded no contest after being arrested on suspicion of multiple felony charges of sexually assaulting 12 teen girls.
Los Angeles County officials are saying the defendant entered the plea during a hearing to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial. So far, Richard Turner has pleaded no contest to 13 counts of sexually assaulting 12 girls.
Prosecutors have said that he will likely spend the last of his days in prison. The defendant was initially facing 21 felony charges for interactions with students that took place between 2017 to 2022.
Prior to this time period, a student at Van Nuys High School said that Richard Turner touched her inappropriately. Prosecutors have said that the plea deal saves the victims from the traumatic experience of testifying at trial.
Liability For Sexual Abuse By Athletic Coaches
A large portion of the sexual abuse that takes place in schools involves athletic trainers and coaches. According to Business Insider, “The difference between coaches and academic teachers is that coaches might have access to students in unique ways. School coaches are tasked with guiding student-athletes through difficult physical maneuvers. That often means that coaches have to physically place their hands on a student to either evaluate a complaint of pain or demonstrate a way to complete an action.” There are a number of signs that school officials should look for to indicate that coaches may be engaging in misconduct.

Coaches may engage in overly personal interactions with students in ways that seem excessive. 
Coaches may be secretive about their interactions with students. 
Coaches may ignore or cross professional boundaries. 
Coaches may be the subject of past complaints of misconduct.

Schools have a legal obligation to protect students from the sexual predation of their employees. Consider, for example, Taylor v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 17 Cal. 2d 594 [110 P.2d 1044], “It is the duty of the school authorities to supervise at all times the conduct of the children on the school grounds and to enforce those rules and regulations necessary to their protection.” School officials are also mandated reporters. They can be held criminally liable for failing to report reasonably suspected instances of child abuse. There are many ways that a school may have failed to properly protect a student from sexual abuse.

A school may have failed to conduct thorough background checks. 
A school may have failed to adequately supervise the students in their care. 
School officials may have failed to report a suspected instance of misconduct. 
School officials may have failed to set clear guidelines between faculty and students.

Much of the sexual abuse that takes place in schools is preventable. It is much more likely at schools that refuse to accept responsibility for what is going on. Sadly, though, schools will often do everything that they can to deny responsibility if students in their care are sexually abused. Any person who is sexually abused by a school official does have rights. They are able to seek some measure of justice through a civil claim.
Getting Legal Help After Los Angeles County School Sexual Abuse 
We at the Carrillo Law Firm, LLP extend our best wishes to all of the people who have been impacted by the actions of Richard Turner. It is our sincere hope that the school district will implement additional measures to prevent abuse. There needs to be accountability across the board for what took place.

1006,rd_url,"No one was injured or killed Friday morning when Sierra Northern Railway tracks came apart in a saturated gully and two empty tank cars weighing 30 to 35 tons each derailed at 5 to 10 miles per hour on Hospital Road, next to the U.S. Post Office on South Washington Street in downtown Sonora.
The screeching sounds of heavy metal tearing apart wood railroad ties and thick pavement scared some witnesses, as the trailing tank car veered 15 to 20 feet off the tracks and damaged five vehicles parked next to the Post Office.
The derailed train then chopped down a metal crossing cantilever over South Washington Street. That’s where the last two cars came to rest, blocking South Washington Street from 9:20 a.m. through at least Friday afternoon.
Sonora Police Cpl. Thomas Brickley said the estimated time for reopening South Washington Street was 7 p.m. Two Caterpillar bulldozers on tracks were among the heavy equipment being used to move the derailed train cars.
Ken Beard, chief executive officer of Sierra Northern Railway, said in a phone interview Friday afternoon that the cause of the crash remained under investigation.
At 10 a.m. Friday, about 40 minutes after the derailment, a pink piece of plastic tape with “57 ½” and “Drainage Issue” handwritten on it lay on the tracks where one rail began to wrench free from its moorings about 100 yards uphill from the Post Office.
Beard said the tracks in that location were first put in back in 1897, though they have been upgraded multiple times over the past 126 years and are on a schedule to be upgraded again.
“We got a grant to upgrade from Riverside to Standard,” Beard said. “About a month ago, our track inspectors walked the whole line out there.”
The inspectors marked that area for improving the 57 ½ inch gage to a standard 56 ½ inch gage, Beard said. The railroad cars used on the line can run on gages from 56 to 58 inches wide.
Linda Darby, 63, of Sonora, saw and heard the derailment without realizing at least one tank car was completely off the tracks as it passed her vehicle on Hospital Road.
“I was just waiting here for the train to pass,” Darby said. “It was near the end of the train I saw all this smoke. I thought it was smoke. You couldn’t see through it. I didn’t want to breathe it. It was squeaking pretty loud, it sounded like metal on metal. And then all these people were coming out here looking and I thought ‘what are they looking at.’ The last car came by making all this noise and I didn’t even realize it was off the tracks.”
Anthony Hernandez, of Avery, was at work at the Sonora Post Office when it happened. He didn’t see it, but he ran outside when coworkers outside loading packages into trucks began shouting, “Oh snap, the train’s derailing! The train’s derailing!”
“I came out and my car was already messed up,” Hernandez said of the used 2020 four-wheel-drive Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport he’d just bought in August, which he estimates is now totaled. “It’s the only vehicle I own for my family.”
Hernandez’ Jeep got dragged 20 to 30 feet from its legal parking spot on Hospital Road and smashed into a sign in the Post Office front parking lot on South Washington Street.
By 11:15 a.m. Friday, Hernandez had spent nearly two hours solid on the phone with insurers, trying to get his claim in and secure a tow truck and a replacement rental vehicle.
Post Office employee Reggie Van Sleet was inside working when he heard coworkers start talking about a derailment.
“A friend of mine came running in and he said ‘Reggie, your truck’s destroyed. A train just derailed.’ I thought he was joking,” Van Sleet said. “It was chaos out here. My truck, the red one, was sitting right up in front of the intersection.”
His Chevrolet Avalanche got battered and pushed more than 50 feet from where it was parked. The wheels of the trailing derailed tank car left distinct cuts in the pavement of Hospital Road from the point it derailed along its path veering 15 to 20 feet from the tracks, to where it came to rest on South Washington Street.
Postal worker Charity Stevens said she was out on her route delivering packages when a coworker called and told her about the derailment and told her that her vehicle parked on Hospital Road did not get hit. She was relieved.
“Mine’s good. Whew!” Stevens said. “I’m sorry for everybody else. I’m glad no one was hurt. That’s crazy it derailed because it doesn’t seem like it goes that fast through here. They come through every day. Usually lumber. Maybe 5 miles an hour. They blow their horn really loud.”
Beard said the company has insurance to cover such damage to private property.
David Rupert, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service, said that the Sonora Post Office would be fully operational Saturday and all routes would be delivered. He asked people to consider using an alternate location if they need to mail something out to avoid impacting emergency workers or delivery service.
Sonora Mayor Mark Plummer praised the city fire and police departments’ response to the derailment. He walked the section of tracks that came apart within an hour of the derailment and said it was fortunate that the tank cars were empty, because they are used to carry propane.
Sonora Fire Capt. Brittan Gregory said the train contained four flat cars loaded with covered materials and four tank cars directly behind them. Beard said the flat cars were hauling lumber.
Beard said the company typically runs trains through Sonora three to four days per week during the winter due to the increased demand for propane. He said they mainly haul lumber during the summer a couple days per week.
Derailments on the Oakdale-based company’s tracks are rare, Beard said, but the previous two wetter-than-normal winters have caused more issues than they’ve typically seen in the past.
“The ground gets soft, the ties get soft and it’s hard to hold the rail engaged,” he said.
The company previously had a minor derailment of an empty tank car in Jamestown on March 16 last year. That incident caught attention because it occurred a little over a month after a Norfolk Southern Railway train carrying hazardous materials derailed in Ohio and caused a massive environmental disaster that forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents in the nearby town of East Palestine.
According to federal data, as many as three trains derail per day in the United States, with half of those carrying hazardous materials, though relatively few cause disasters such as the one seen in Ohio.
Beard noted that Sierra Northern Railway is currently in the midst of a six-year plan to rehabilitate the entire 55-mile freight line of railroad tracks between Riverbank and Sonora.
In June 2019, the Modesto Bee reported the company received a nearly $17.4 million federal grant for the nearly $36 million project that will involve new ties, rails and road crossings. The rest of the cost would be covered by the company, the Bee reported.
The Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors voted to support the company’s original grant application for the project in 2017.

During the course of the investigation into the deadly shooting that occurred at the 24-Hour Fitness in Brentwood on Thursday, August 11, 2022, at approximately 1:54 a.m., Brentwood Police investigators positively identified 20-year-old Pittsburg resident Faatino Arona Tauane as the second shooter in this case.
On Wednesday, August 24, 2022, at approximately 4:45 a.m., Tauane was peacefully taken into custody at a home in the 900 block of Myrtlewood Drive in Antioch. He was later booked at the Martinez Detention Facility for murder. To date, one firearm has been recovered and the vehicle Tauane used to flee the scene is now in police custody. A second firearm used in the shooting remains outstanding.
On Friday, August 26, 2022, the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office charged Tauane with one count of murder with enhancements and additional felonies.
On Thursday, August 11, 2022, the first of two suspects detained during the early stages of the investigation had been positively identified as one of the shooters who was wounded during the altercation. The suspect, a 17-year-old Brentwood resident was booked into the Contra Costa County Juvenile Detention Center for murder. His name is being withheld due to age. The second suspect was released from police custody after it was determined he was not a shooter.
The decedent has been identified as, 21-year-old Antioch resident, Cesar Arana. Our hearts go out to the family and friends impacted by his untimely death.
Arana was an innocent bystander not involved in the initial altercation. He was struck by gunfire while trying to help a person who had fallen to the ground during a physical fight outside.
Additionally, our agency would like to thank those who came forward with additional video footage and the staff at 24 Hour Fitness for their full cooperation throughout the entire investigation.
According to localcrimenews.com, Tauane was also arrested by Pittsburg Police in December 2021, for carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle and when not the registered owner.
Anyone with information regarding the outstanding firearm or any additional information related to this investigation is asked to contact Detective Greene at 925-809-7797.

He says he made a left hand turn, across a set of L.A. Metro train tracks — and had no idea a train was speeding his way.

""No indications that the lights were blinking and I didn't hear any bells, it was too late,"" he said. ""I looked to the left and a train just hit me. Next thing I knew, I basically woke up in the hospital.""

Security footage shows the incident. The train hits Moss' BMW at full speed as he tries to make his turn.

""It's a miracle that I'm standing here and I have nightmares about this,"" he said. ""I'm very lucky to be alive.""

The 60-year-old suffered broken bones and major internal injuries. He said he continues to deal with pain, but he is thankful to be alive to tell his story.

""Fortunate for me, I got hit on the left side of my car and the train pushed me back out and that's how the car did not end up on the tracks,"" he said. ""If I didn't survive that accident, no one would know about this.""

He said he believes his accident could have been prevented, and he wants to see changes before other drivers are hurt or killed.

""I was allowed to enter the intersection and there was no gate to stop me from entering the intersection,"" he said.

A spokesperson for the L.A. Metro said they performed a post-accident inspection their equipment and found that all warning lights, crossing gates, and warning bells were functioning at the time of the accident. They also said the driver made an illegal left turn and used the wrong traffic lane to circumvent the lowered crossing gate.

""Regardless of what they're saying about I entered on the wrong lane, no one should be allowed to enter period,"" Moss said about the statement.

L.A. Metro said drivers need to strictly follow the safety measures already in place. But, Moss said the crossing gate should be extended all the way across to prevent drivers from turning onto the tracks completely.

What we heard and quickly saw, others saw before us, as the big rig driver drove straight into the Capitol.
CBS13 spoke to three witnesses that night who described what happened.
""All of a sudden, I look to my left as I was passing the Capitol and I saw a semi—what looked to be a semi truck—pulled into the step area. It looked like it had either backed in or smashed in. I didn't see any movement in the truck. And all of a sudden, boom, fire. And I thought, 'My God, they're bombing the Capitol,"" the first witness said.
""I was standing on the corner of 11th and O [streets], and I saw the semi go by really fast. And I thought, isn't there a stop sign there? I noticed he was going really, really fast. And then I hear this big boom, then I look around the corner, then there's fire,"" the second witness said.


Similar accounts surfaced of the man behind the wheel driving around a several square block area, speeding down 11th Street to apparently gain momentum.
""We saw a big trailer going by. He must have been going 65 mph. I didn't see what direction he went, but I know when he hit N Street, there's only one way you can go, and that's eastbound,"" the third witness said.
Minutes later, the big rig accelerated again, going full-bore into the state Capitol.
""This time, he had to be flying at least 75 mph, and he just went through the stop sign, and luckily the light rail stopped. If not, he would have took the light rail. He went to through the stop sign, went through the lights, I saw him bounce one, the second bounce was straight into the Capitol and it went up in flames,"" the third witness said.
Authorities on hand describe the driver's actions as a deliberate criminal act, which now leaves a footnote of a suicide attack in the history of California's Capitol.

THE INVESTIGATION
""When they heard about him next, it would be his death, and it would be a very grandiose act on his part.""


That's what 37-year-old Mike Bowers told his friends before he took his own life. On Jan. 16, 2001, the Riverside County man drove his 78,000-pound 18-wheeler into the south entrance of the Capitol at a speed of 46 mph.
""He was very unhappy, made some—not threats, I don't want to indicate that—but voiced discontent with the California government, as well the governor of the state of California.""
The California Highway Patrol released a three-volume, 77-page summary in February 2001 concluding Bowers acted alone and was sober at the time of the crash. According to the report, Bowers had drug, petty theft, battery and DUI convictions. In 1986 and 1991, he was placed in two state mental hospitals. In the past decade, he began a friendship with the Aryan Brotherhood and created an organization called New Order of the World, calling himself the king.
Bowers was unable to hold down a job until he was hired by a trucking company in March 2000. Even his driver's training instructor recommended Bowers be terminated.
""The training instructor immediately called back to their dispatcher and indicated [Bowers] could not drive the truck, that he was very concerned, would not put him in a truck, and he was overruled and [Bowers] was given a job. That training instructor left the company employment at that particular time.""
The report also says Bowers nearly missed an inbound light-rail train by 30 seconds and an outbound light-rail train by 45 seconds, with each train carrying some 180 passengers.
""It was just by accident he missed that train. You could not see it coming down the road at the speed he was traveling.""

Corona residents looking for solutions as feral hogs continue to tear up yards

Wild hogs are running rampant in Corona and residents say it's becoming a growing problem that's posing a threat to the safety of families and pets all across the area.

Wild hogs are running rampant in Corona and residents say it's becoming a growing problem that's posing a threat to the safety of families and pets all across the area.

CORONA, Calif. (KABC) -- Wild hogs are running rampant in Corona and residents say it's becoming a growing problem that's posing a threat to the safety of families and pets all across the area.

""The pigs have been coming,"" said Corona resident Judy Gardner. ""They came here to my house on Halloween night, and then they came back on Veterans Day, and probably going to be here for Thanksgiving.

Homeowners have captured the hogs - who have caused significant damage to people's lawns - on home surveillance cameras wandering through neighborhoods.

""I came down and saw the damage and kind of immediately knew that it was the wild boars kind of tormenting our neighborhood,"" said resident Julie Chiasson.

City officials say they're aware of the issue and say it's been on their radar for quite some time.

In July, the Corona City Council had an official with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife discuss possible options to deal with the feral pig population, which included allowing homeowners and others the ability to hunt them.

""The options are basically to do trapping or remain the status quo, and unfortunately the status quo, for most, folks is pretty destructive,"" said Corona vice mayor Wes Speake.

1151,gs_url,"The Angeles National Forest offers the 10 million residents of neighboring Los Angeles County a true escape from the urban environment. Covering over 650,000 acres and with elevations ranging from 1,200 to over 10,000 feet, the forests spectacular scenery and range of recreational activities on offer from camping and fishing to hiking, skiing and swimming attracts about four million visitors each year.
With such a vast amount of traffic making its way up and down the mountain, accidents do happen and vehicles sometimes end up over the roads edge on the slopes of the mountains.
Last July, Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD), Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department (LASD) mountain search and rescue, U.S. Forest Service, San Bernardino Fire Department, California Highway Patrol and other local agencies trained together for three days to prepare for such over the side rescue scenarios. The training simulated accidents including cars, trucks, motorcycles and mass-casualty buses and vans. Each scenario was different, with varying levels of difficulty, but all integrated a multi-agency emergency response.
The training saw participation from ground and air operations, with LACoFD providing a Bell 412EP and a paramedic crew, while LASD provided Air Rescue 5 its Sikorsky SH-3H Sea King, along with a paramedic crew.
The objective of the exercise was to have a multi-agency drill involving those agencies responsible for the mountainous areas of Los Angeles County, and to review operational differences in procedure, so that solutions could be found for any problems identified. On the air operations side, the commanders wanted to make sure operational procedures and interactions were understood by the rescue units and the helicopter crews.
Over the three days of training, multiple scenarios were set up, from a single motorcycle over the side to a large multi-casualty bus crash with over 20 victims. After ground search and rescue personnel began working at the scene, LACoFD Copter 12 would hoist a paramedic down to the scene. Then, after a victim was packaged they would be hoisted into the helicopter for transport.
On the days LASD Air Rescue 5 could attend (it was called away for some real-world operations), it performed hoist rescues and lowered paramedics to the scene of the scenario. The LASD will soon be receiving the first new AS-332L1 Super Pumas a helicopter that should provide increased performance in the hot and high conditions in which the unit normally operates.
In a mass-casualty accident, such as the Metrolink train crash in 2008, multiple helicopters would be requested to assist the response. Between LACoFD, LASD air rescue and, if needed, Los Angeles City Fire Department, this is something Los Angeles is well capable of providing. If such a worst case scenario were to happen, the refining of multi-agency operations involving ground and air units from the recent training at Angeles National Forest will mean those tasked with the response are better prepared than ever.",NO
712,np_html,"When Wynn Resorts secured the sole Boston-area casino license, it took on the steep challenge of building a five-star resort in one of the oldest, most densely populated cities in the United States.With it, it inherited a pile of challenges: The T is too far from Everett, Sullivan Square isn’t walkable, a minor accident at rush hour can quickly turn Broadway into a parking lot. Locals feared that the casino’s popularity would turn downtown Everett into a parking lot during rush hour.Robert DeSalvio was barely two weeks on the job as president of Encore Boston Harbor when he heard these concerns.Five years later, company executives are preparing to open the $2.6 billion casino on June 23, potentially drawing tens of thousands of people that day to the 3.4-square-mile city of 46,000 people. In that time, DeSalvio and James Folk, head of transportation, have consulted engineers, bus companies, police officers and boating experts. They have come up with a series of public transit options for patrons coming from as far as Providence.“Wherever you’re coming from, there’s a way to get here without driving,” Folk said in an interview with MassLive.Wynn Resorts aims to bring up to 8 million visitors a year to Encore Boston Harbor, but officials hope they won’t disrupt traffic in the long term. If it works, the Everett casino could serve as a test for companies abroad considering casinos in urban centers.“This is the first resort built in an urban core ... They realize we’re going to have to create vehicular connectivity and public transportation connectivity to a resort if you put one in Yokohama or Tokyo or Osaka,” said Michael Weaver, spokesman for Wynn Resorts.The June 23 opening date seemed uncertain as Wynn Resorts faced a suitability review from Massachusetts regulators. The company ultimately paid a $35 million fine and a $500,000 fine against CEO Matt Maddox over their response to sexual misconduct allegations against founder Steve Wynn. The company agreed to have an independent monitor oversee operations and leadership training for Maddox as conditions to retain its casino license and run Encore Boston Harbor.With the suitability review behind them, company executives are focusing on preparing for the opening less than two weeks away. DeSalvio said he’s confident the company’s contingency plans will mitigate the traffic impact. The company just needs to convince visitors from across New England to give the alternative transportation options a chance and spare Everett the traffic jams.Parking at EncoreEncore Boston Harbor has only 2,900 parking spaces in its garage, a fraction of the spaces it would typically need to accommodate its patrons. There’s another 700 parking spots on the lot across the street at 31 Mystic St. By comparison, the smaller MGM Springfield casino and resort, which opened last August, has a 3,400 space parking garage.Don’t bother looking for a spot around the corner. The closest residential neighborhood, located nearly a half-mile up the street, was recently approved for 24-hour residential permit parking. Anyone who parks there without the permit sticker can get towed and face hundreds of dollars in fees. Encore Boston Harbor’s website also notes that Everett won’t have street parking.DeSalvio and Folk recommend that visitors rely on T and busses in the Greater Boston area or, for those outside of the region, take the commuter rail. For those who do drive in, the company secured another 5,000 parking spaces in lots off-site in hopes of keeping cars off the roads in Everett.There are 1,300 parking spaces at Wellington Station, 1,350 spaces at the Station Landing garage in Medford, 188 spaces at the Malden Station parking lot, 651 spaces at the Jackson Garage at Malden Center Station and 1,436 parking spaces at the Wonderland Station parking lot.Visitors could leave their cars at the station parking lot, paying under $10 to park, and hop on free bus shuttles provided by Encore to get to the casino.There is also parking lot on Rivergreen Drive in Everett, but that only has 625 spaces. Patrons who park there can get on the Neighborhood Runner, a free local shuttle bus that runs 24 hours, seven days a week.Folk also recommended that people coming from the west park their cars at the Alewife MBTA station parking lot, which has roughly 3,000 spaces. Visitors would need to take the Red Line inbound until Downtown Crossing, where they would need to switch to the Orange Line to get to Wellington station. The trip takes roughly 45 minutes.“We’re actually saying the whole MBTA network, utilize that to get you to Wellington station, and we’ll take it from there,"" Folk said.For those who do drive, Encore Boston Harbor put up signs to help direct drivers at the highways and rotaries near the casino. DeSalvio said the signs would hopefully cut down on people getting lost and disrupting traffic.“You don’t want somebody to get off, hang a right and go down Main Street into Charlestown if they’re coming to Encore Boston Harbor, exactly what the community didn’t want,” said DeSalvio, adding that the approval process alone took more than a year.Shuttle buses from MBTA stations, park and ridesWynn Resorts announced in March that Encore Boston Harbor would offer shuttle service to and from the Wellington and Malden Center stations. The shuttles are free and meet accessibility standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act.The Wellington station shuttle will run 24 hours a day, arriving every 10 to 20 minutes and heading to Encore Boston Harbor. The Malden Center station shuttle will run from 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., arriving every 20 minutes. That shuttle makes a stop at Wellington Station on the way to Encore Boston Harbor.Visitors taking the commuter rail into Boston can jump on the Orange Line toward Oak Grove and get off at Wellington Station.Encore Boston Harbor also plans to add regional buses will pick up guests from park and rides in Rockland, Millbury and Londonderry, New Hampshire. The three routes will have nine premium buses that seat 49 passengers.A shuttle bus will also be available on June 23 at the Wonderland stop on the Blue Line, but officials said that likely wouldn’t continue after Opening Day.Encore launched the 26-passenger coach bus called the Neighborhood Runner, which offers free shuttle service around Everett and Chelsea 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Neighborhood Runner from ChelseaThe 26-passenger coach bus has stops at the Chelsea T station on the Silver Line, Everett City Hall, Rivergreen Drive and Encore Boston Harbor. The free shuttle runs every 20 minutes for 24 hours, seven days a week, Folk said.The service offers locals a safe alternative to driving or bicycling home if they’ve had too much to drink, which was a concern for some Massachusetts regulators when Encore executives requested to serve alcohol to active gamblers until 4 a.m.But perhaps the biggest beneficiaries are downtown Everett business owners. John Tocco, executive director of government affairs, told city councilors last week that he estimates the shuttle could bring potentially millions of patrons to the small businesses near city hall.The neighborhood shuttle service started running on Monday. Employees who live in Everett have already started using it to get to work, DeSalvio told MassLive.“What it’s telling me is this can work. This can work,” he said. “If you give them a convenient offer, you can get people to change their pattern a little bit.”Encore Boston Harbor, the casino and resort set to open in Everett in June 2019, is introducing water shuttle transportation across Boston Harbor and the Mystic River. Builders at BostonBoatwork in Charlestown showcased the luxury-style boat on Thursday, May 9, 2019. (Kristin LaFratta/MassLive)Water shuttlesEncore Boston Harbor envisions a transportation system that uses the coastline as an easier way to get around. Ignore the traffic, executives say, and sail on over on one of their four “mini-yachts.""With the help of Charlestown luxury boat-builders Boston BoatWorks, Encore will deploy four, $1 million sleek water shuttles to connect South Boston to Everett. With plush white leather seating, varnished teakwood and flat-screen TVs, these vessels are made to match the luxurious atmosphere of the resort, spokespeople say.For an introductory fare of $7, the boats will run every 20-30 minutes between the east side of the World Trade Center in the Boston Seaport, to the north side of Long Wharf, to Encore in Everett. For those riding just between the Seaport and Long Wharf, rides will cost only $5. The shuttles seat up to 35 passengers per boat, are accessible to those with disabilities and will operate seven days-a-week, year-round from 7 a.m. to 12 a.m.According to Encore’s transportation executive Jim Folk, the shuttle will actually further connect the North Shore and South Shore by picking up where the MBTA leaves off. What may be an hour-long drive or train ride with multiple connections during rush hour could instead be a pleasant cruise from the Boston Seaport to the casino’s Mystic River port.Executives said they aimed to keep introductory fares low at $7 in order to encourage people to test the boats out. The hope is that passengers may become hooked, tell their friends, and popularize this less-conventional form of transportation.Those who have their own boat can also dock at the casino, though there are a limited number of docking spaces there and overnight docking will not be offered. The company has hired its own harbormaster to oversee water operations at Encore.Read more: Encore Boston Harbor introduces ‘premium’ water shuttles with $7 fares from Seaport, Long Wharf to EverettBluebikes in Boston.Bike share programEncore Boston Harbor is partnering with Metro Boston’s bike-share program Bluebikes. The biking rental system, operated by Lyft-acquired Motivate, is available in Boston, Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville and will now be accessible in Everett too, where competitor Lime has already made a footprint with its dockless bikes and electric bicycles.Encore announced sponsorship for Bluebike stations with 15 bikes each. One station will be located on-site, near the service road by the casino’s harbor walkway, and the second station will be located a short distance from Encore’s main entrance on Broadway.For those who wish to bring their own bikes to Encore, the resort will create an entire level of the parking garage that is dedicated to bicycle parking. On B1, 96 car-sized spaces will accommodate parking for up to 192 bicycles, according to Encore’s transportation presentation.In this Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016, file photo, a driver displaying Lyft and Uber stickers on his front windshield drops off a customer in downtown Los Angeles. The Plain DealerSeparate lot for Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing servicesPerhaps the most convenient way to get home from Encore Boston Harbor will be ordering an Uber/Lyft, especially in the early mornings when the MBTA is shut down. But that demand would mean more motorists riding around the streets waiting for a ride.Wynn Resorts used a patch of land across the street to build a lot to keep the ridesharing services, cabs and private limos off the road while they wait for passengers. The lot holds about 100 vehicles.The lot is still under construction, but the company plans to have it geofenced and ready by the time doors open.When a customer opens a ridesharing app or calls for a cab, the idea is that those drivers are already waiting in the lot, “so that they’re readily available, but they’re not driving around,” DeSalvio said.Sullivan Square MBTA Station in CharlestownWhat about employee parking? Massachusetts regulations require Encore Boston Harbor to offer its employees parking.None of the parking at the onsite garage is currently set aside for employees. The company agreed to set aside 800 spaces for its workers and has set aside 700 at the Station Landing parking garage in Medford. The company is in negotiations to set aside the other 100 employee parking spaces elsewhere.Encore Boston Harbor executives, however, hope the employees won’t need the spaces. They added incentives to keep its workers off the roads. The company covers MBTA monthly passes by 50 percent, up to $50, Folk said.The employees have their own 24-hour shuttle buses at Wellington station and access to the other shuttle services, like the rest of the public.Encore Boston Harbor Casino in Everett.Encore’s future transportation visionEncore executives envision a much more connected Metro Boston in the future, and they want their five-star casino and resort to be the impetus for transportation growth.DeSalvio, drawing on findings from the Lower Mystic Regional Working Group, feels development around Encore could make it a perfect hub for more public transportation routes.The president painted a future vision of a more interconnected Everett, Somerville, Medford and Charlestown. He pictures an extension of the Silver Line from Chelsea to Everett, connecting the MBTA route to Encore and continuing to Sullivan Square to meet the Orange Line. DeSalvio also said property behind the casino and resort is an ideal space for a commuter rail stop that could make the stretch of Broadway even more accessible to people outside of the Metro Boston area.In another move to simplify the visitor’s multimodal journey, DeSalvio said Encore is in preliminary talks to construct a pedestrian-friendly bridge across the Mystic River -- from Assembly Row and the MBTA Orange Line station there -- to Encore. The towering hotel is already visible to those waiting for the T at Assembly station, and in the near future it may be just a short walk away.As for water transportation, Folk thinks positive results in the water shuttle service could spur more coastal travel. Docks in Lynn, Salem and Quincy have expressed interest and could become potential destinations for the shuttles, depending on ridership.Though most of these future transportation plans are far from fruition, it is clear Encore has a mission to connect residents near and far to its resort grounds. Just how much Encore’s plans will ultimately benefit the transportation networks in Everett and Greater Boston remains to be seen.“At the end of the day, it’s going to be busy,” DeSalvio said. “We’re not in any way, shape or form saying we’re not going to be a very busy place, but the whole idea was to (a) mitigate our traffic and (b) come up with alternatives. I believe we’ve fulfilled that obligation.”",NO
1254,rd_url,"One year after a pledge died, San Diego State struggles to control its fraternities
- Share via
SAN DIEGO — It should have been a momentous night, the kind a fraternity pledge remembers forever.
Three months into his freshman year at San Diego State, Dylan Hernandez was going to learn the name of his “big brother” in a ritual at Phi Gamma Delta.
But not long after the celebration ended, tragedy struck.
Following a night of heavy drinking, the 19-year-old Floridian returned to his dorm, where he fell out of his bunk bed and struck his head. Students found Hernandez unconscious in his Tenochca Hall room and frantically dialed 911.
It proved to be a fatal blow. Campus police would later determine that Hernandez’s blood-alcohol level was, at one point, about 0.23%, almost three times the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle.
But as shocking as the death was, it fit a pattern. For years, San Diego State has been plagued by dangerous and sometimes illegal behaviors within its clutch of fraternities and sororities.
Now, one year after the tragedy, the scope of that misconduct is coming into focus.
An investigation by the San Diego Union-Tribune revealed that in the five years leading up to the accident, Greek chapters were widely and repeatedly called to account for a slew of violations. They allowed underage students to drink alcohol, performed abusive hazing rituals, and were accused of sexual harassment and assault, according to confidential records obtained through the California Public Records Act.
The disciplinary letters showed that 19 fraternities and sororities found themselves in some level of official trouble with the school from 2014 through 2019. That is nearly 40% of at least 49 Greek chapters that were active at the time.
The records describe raucous parties — some attended by hundreds of people — where kegs of beer, hard alcohol and drugs were on hand. They cite at least 18 instances of students being taken to hospitals after drinking too much or suffering some sort of injury, as well as descriptions of serious property damage, including one frat house that was later deemed “unlivable.”
Those 18 transports only reflect incidents that became part of a campus disciplinary procedure. San Diego State says 365 students were taken to hospitals for alcohol and drug-related issues from fall 2015 through fall 2019. The school is not sure how many of those incidents directly involved fraternities and sororities, which rule over the university’s party scene.
Most of the 41 disciplinary letters summarize San Diego State’s investigation into specific policy violations and detail the punishment and stipulations that resulted. Often the university required fraternities and sororities to take specific actions, such as attend educational workshops or develop safety plans for future events, before they could return to good standing.
Despite their bureaucratic language, the letters contain plenty of detail, giving a sense of what it’s like when Greek life goes awry.
The records describe two cases involving both a sorority and a fraternity that were accused of dissuading people who believed they had been drugged at parties from reporting the incident. In another instance, a fraternity held a “Career Day” event featuring a banner that was supposed to look like a porn star’s resume. Near the top was the name of a specific female student.
In one instance, a fraternity member who was serving as a “risk management” officer poured hard liquor down an ice luge for people to consume. A different fraternity engaged in hazing behaviors that involved “forced consumption of alcohol … and group violence” resulting in several injuries, records show.
One fraternity was put on interim suspension for reportedly forcing new members to live in a single room with a chicken. A sorority was put on probation after a midnight hazing ritual that made all of the pledges consider quitting.
The disciplinary records show that 12 of the 13 fraternities that were investigated by San Diego State from 2014 through 2019 violated policies multiple times over. In some cases, the violations occurred while the fraternity was still under sanctions from a previous incident. And suspending or expelling fraternities is a process that can take years.
San Diego State praises its Greek life program on its website, saying it helps students mature and prosper. As is true at other schools, most of these Greek organizations do not get into trouble, and many alumni of fraternities and sororities consider the experience a defining time of their lives.
But campus officials told the Union-Tribune that it regarded fraternities as “high risk” organizations because so many of them ran afoul of the university’s rules.
San Diego State’s Hernandez was one of at least 48 students to die in Greek-related incidents around the country from 2000 to 2019. Eleven of the deaths happened in California.
Florida State University suspended its entire Greek system following the death of a fraternity student. But the ban wasn’t permanent, and such episodes, locally and nationally, have not dimmed the appeal of fraternities and sororities.
Today, because of the coronavirus pandemic, most San Diego State students are taking classes online. But the party scene in the College Area community has continued to crackle. Health officials said students in that neighborhood contributed to the coronavirus outbreak that surfaced in August.
Since the fall semester began, more than 1,400 San Diego State students have tested positive for the virus, the highest number of any college or university in California.
The school staunched the outbreak, partly by confining residential students to campus dorms for part of September. San Diego State officials also roamed the streets of College Area, looking for students who were violating the COVID-19 rules.
On Oct. 30, county health officials took the unprecedented step of issuing cease-and-desist orders to eight College Area homes because they were rumored to be the sites for upcoming Halloween parties. Six of the homes were San Diego State fraternity and sorority houses, health officials said. University officials said they requested that the county take such action to help the school adhere to public health guidelines regarding COVID-19.
After Hernandez‘s death, university President Adela de la Torre created two task forces, one that examined student activities and safety and one that studied alcohol and drug misuse.
The groups, which were largely run by people who work or study at San Diego State, or alumni and school supporters, did not clearly quantify the depth of alcohol use and abuse among the school’s student body in general or Greek life in particular.
Nor did San Diego State seek to overhaul how fraternities and sororities operate, or provide a detailed account of why the school has so many medical transports.
Not all fraternity violations are serious. But the ones that are serious often have a common denominator: alcohol.
It’s a constant source of worry for college administrators nationwide. Even though most college students won’t be old enough to legally drink until they’re several years into their college experience, about 1,500 a year die of alcohol-related injuries.
About 30% of full-time college students ages 18 to 22 engaged in binge drinking in 2018, according to a large federal survey.
At San Diego State, the use of alcohol by the Greeks and the rest of the student body is so pervasive the university estimates that several thousand students would benefit from recovery programs.
The problem is central to the disciplinary record of Phi Gamma Delta, the fraternity where Hernandez drank during last year’s big brother-little brother ceremony.
According to university records, Phi Gamma Delta was repeatedly investigated for committing a series of violations in the years before Hernandez’s death.
As early as 2016, allegations of “ongoing hazing,” binge drinking and sexual assault were already being leveled at the fraternity.
One letter describes a Phi Gamma Delta social event in which two people were transported to a hospital, one for intoxication and one for an injury. During the same event, there was a report of a sexual assault that quickly resulted in a member being expelled from the fraternity, records say.
San Diego State put the fraternity on probation and required members to undergo a series of educational workshops in 2017. But that wasn’t the end of the trouble. Less than a year later, while the fraternity was still under sanctions from previous violations, the university began investigating a new incident in which Phi Gamma allegedly failed to responsibly handle alcohol and keep it away from minors.
Phi Gamma challenged the allegations but got pushback from university officials who suspected members of lying and retaliating against people who spoke out against the fraternity, records say.
“This behavior demonstrates that Phi Gamma Delta is more concerned with who the chapter believes ‘wronged’ the fraternity than holding chapter members and the organization accountable,” a disciplinary letter says.
The college placed new sanctions on the fraternity, but in early 2019 it was again accused of giving alcohol to underage people. Later that year, Hernandez died.
In August, the fraternity’s national office permanently suspended its San Diego State chapter, citing the university police department’s investigation into Hernandez’s death. The university also expelled the organization until 2030.

On a hot July afternoon in 2018, Gregory West found himself trudging through the mountains of northern Tennessee on what would be the last walk of his life.
The engineer and his conductor had been stuck behind a stalled train that had not budged by the end of their shift, and rail company officials told them to walk out to a road where a vehicle could meet them. It would be an hour’s journey up and down steep hills in 88-degree heat. And West, 57, had to lug two large bags of his belongings the entire way. Just as he reached the rendezvous point, he collapsed. The Campbell County medical examiner said West had pneumonia and hypertension, which decreased his oxygen supply before he died. His sister sued the railroad company, CSX, which settled with her for an undisclosed amount.
But none of that is reflected in CSX’s worker injury statistics. ProPublica only found out about it while reviewing lawsuits levied against the nation’s largest freight carriers in the past 15 years. West’s was one of at least 130 worker deaths and other injuries that were alleged to have happened on the job but that railroad companies never reported to regulators.
Among the others, according to the lawsuits, were a CSX conductor who suffered a fatal heart attack after doing physical labor on a subfreezing overnight shift and a contractor who lost three fingers rigging equipment in a Norfolk Southern rail yard.
The Federal Railroad Administration requires companies to report such incidents because knowing about them allows officials to spot broader lapses and hazardous working conditions. The agency’s statistics are the main way the public can view the businesses’ safety records, for which they must answer to their employees’ unions and their shareholders.
But, as ProPublica has previously reported, railroad companies go to extreme lengths to portray themselves as safer than they really are — retaliating against workers who report defects and silencing those who get injured. Officials with the FRA have said there is not much they can do about the forces — like the financial implications of appearing to admit liability and a culture that faults managers when employees get hurt on their watch — that can drive companies to quash injury reporting.
This tranche of missing injuries and deaths, however, exposes the clearest failure by regulators to hold companies accountable.
Much of the problem stems from the FRA’s porous reporting policies, which ProPublica found provide opportunities for companies to hide work-related injuries and deaths. Officials say they have spent the past five years working on revisions, which they plan to unveil this year. They said disclosing the details now would be a breach of the rulemaking process, but they mentioned that their changes could address issues raised by ProPublica’s reporting.
ProPublica's findings show the powerful rail companies have long benefitted from loopholes.
Though agency officials say they are aware of conflicts of interest that steer railroad companies toward keeping worker injuries quiet, FRA policies give the businesses broad latitude to determine whether injuries and even on-the-job deaths are work-related — and, thus, whether they need to be reported.
One reason companies give for opting out of reporting: Rail company officials believe a worker is lying, an argument the companies have made in court, and one juries and judges have sometimes rejected.
The agency also doesn’t require railroad companies to report certain injuries and deaths of contractors who are crushed or maimed by trains. Those incidents are supposed to be reported to a different agency by the contractor’s employer, which doesn’t tie them to the railroad’s record or allow them to be easily studied for possible safety reforms.
Empowered to levy fines up to $10,000 against companies that willfully fail to report injuries, and even to disqualify managers who do so, FRA officials say they will not be investigating the scores of unreported cases ProPublica provided them in a database — cases they confirmed were nowhere to be found in their records.
The bulk of the cases ProPublica found, including the deaths, happened more than five years ago. The FRA says it does not have the power to punish railroads for unreported injuries after that much time or even edit the safety record to reflect them. It attributes that to a law that applies to all federal regulators.
And though 11 of the alleged injuries ProPublica raised are newer — in two unreported cases, workers said they were fired after being hurt — officials said those won’t be reviewed either. They view lawsuits, which ProPublica used to find the cases, as “unreliable” sources of information.
The FRA is satisfied with its standard process for unearthing hidden injuries, an audit done of each rail company every two years. As part of these four-month deep dives, regulators say they pore through internal company documents to find injuries that were deemed unreportable, then review medical records and interview employees to determine whether the injury should, in fact, have been reported.
Officials didn’t have an explanation for how audits missed the two deaths ProPublica found and said they should have been submitted to the FRA based on the information reporters provided. “Despite our best efforts, regrettably there are cases of failures to report or to accurately capture all covered events,” the agency said in a statement, adding that “any gaps or voids in reporting are of concern and will prompt us to redouble our efforts,” that it expects companies to “faithfully abide” by the requirements and that it strives to continuously improve its data collection and validation.
Each of the railroads denied that they failed to report injuries, largely claiming that the cases either didn’t meet the reporting guidelines, as CSX argued about West’s death, or that the company didn’t believe the worker’s injury happened at work. “Those cases where CSX determined the events were not reportable are fully supported by the facts and evidence gathered by CSX through its thorough investigations of each incident,” the company said in a statement, adding that it was proud of its “best in class” reporting process and that it complies with FRA’s audits.
The Association of American Railroads, the industry’s lobbying arm, denied that underreporting is widespread and called ProPublica’s findings isolated incidents. The association pointed to the most recent injury statistics — the ones ProPublica has found are incomplete — to show the rails are the safest they have ever been.
But union leader Jared Cassity said ProPublica’s findings are further evidence that companies’ safety records do not capture the full range of dangers allowed to persist on the rails. “The system is rigged, especially when it comes to injuries,” said Cassity, the alternate national legislative director for the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, or SMART.
“You see what they want you to see,” he said. 

To find unreported injuries and deaths, ProPublica reviewed more than 5,000 federal lawsuits levied against the nation’s six largest freight railroad companies, the so-called Class 1s, from 2009 to 2022. For each complaint that mentioned a worker injury or death and had a detailed enough description of what happened, ProPublica consulted a 300-page FRA guidebook to determine which cases appeared to fit reporting requirements. Then, journalists combed through the agency’s online railroad injury database to see whether the incidents had been reported and, if not, asked the agency to double check its files.
Clear patterns emerged in cases that weren’t reported.
Unlike trauma deaths or amputations, the vast majority of unreported injuries were open to easier arguments that they were not work-related — sprained ankles, torn rotator cuffs, tweaked backs, strained tendons. One man said he had been in a port-a-potty when a track hoe struck it; another said he was hurt when the railroad’s transport vehicle crashed. One said he slipped along the ballast, the gravel that surrounds train tracks; another said he jumped from a train to avoid a collision.
Broadly speaking, railroads must tell the government about any on-the-job injury that requires medical care beyond diagnostic procedures like X-rays, that requires an employee to miss a day of work, or that lands an employee on light duty.
But rail officials have long found ways to argue that these less-visible soft-tissue injuries, unlike gaping wounds, could have happened off duty or for reasons not related to the work employees were doing.
“The guide gives us the right to make our best guess on a case, and then [the FRA has] to prove us otherwise,” said Tuesdi Sweatt, CSX’s then-senior manager of accident reporting and compliance, in a legal deposition in 2018.
BNSF engineer Scotty Bragg was operating a train near Hardy, Arkansas, on Nov. 17, 2021, when he said he encountered rough track and “experienced significant jostling” in a cab that didn’t have seatbelts. He said he injured his neck, back and spine, requiring surgery. A company official said in a deposition that a review of locomotive footage led officials to decide that Bragg hadn’t encountered rough track and wasn’t injured at work.
It was a familiar argument used against hurt workers. ProPublica has reported on cases in which companies presented video evidence that did not hold up to scrutiny in court, failing to convince juries that an employee was wrong or lying. At least two of these cases resulted in multimillion-dollar payouts to the workers. Despite the company’s denial of Bragg’s injuries, it did agree to settle his case. BNSF’s response did not address any of the unreported cases ProPublica sent the company in a spreadsheet along with an interview request.In a statement, BNSF said it takes its reporting obligations seriously and touted its safety record, which over the last decade, “produced the lowest number of injuries in our railroad’s history.”
The FRA allows companies to decide whether an injury was job-related or not, even when an employee dies at work.
In the case of West, the engineer who died in the mountains, the company said that because he suffered from a “personal condition,” his death didn’t have to be reported. In court, the company said West “suffered from multiple maladies and physical conditions, and as a result, it was not foreseeable” that a “one-half mile walk would cause or contribute to his death.”
The FRA said that even if companies don’t file reports, they must phone in all on-the-job deaths to the U.S. Coast Guard’s National Response Center, no matter the cause. But it is unclear what happens once the agency is contacted; these calls don’t become a part of an official injury record and it’s unclear what trend analysis, if any, is done with them.
CSX conductor Danny Byrom, 37, was working an overnight shift in an Illinois yard on Jan. 27, 2019, while the temperature was around 20 degrees. He bent over to remove a heavy piece of equipment. Afterward, he collapsed and died of cardiac arrest.
When asked about the case, FRA officials said it should have been reported because there was “probably a causal connection” between his work-related exertion and his death. CSX told ProPublica the company believes Byrom’s death wasn’t reportable because he suffered from a “personal condition.” His family’s lawsuit against the company is ongoing.
Agency officials said nontrauma deaths that appear to be natural aren’t likely to immediately spur a full investigation.
The omissions of these kinds of deaths from companies’ safety records — and the lack of any kind of investigation by the FRA — troubles Cassity, the union leader, because the deaths appeared to be related to work tasks. “You’re being forced to do it, and you die in the performance of it. … The fact they don’t consider that is … it’s unconscionable.”
The FRA should investigate all on-the-job deaths, he said, and determine itself whether they were work-related.
Such reporting would help the agency identify and eliminate hazards for workers, said David Michaels, former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which oversees injury and death investigations in most industries outside the rails.
“You certainly want events that occur at work to be reported for the agency to consider whether or not they deserve further investigation, and that will include heart attacks and asthma,” said Michaels, who is now a professor at George Washington University. “And by aggregating information from these investigations, it allows researchers to go in and use the data to better understand what’s going on in these workplaces.”
Had West and Byrom worked at a bank, or a restaurant, or some other American workplace, OSHA would have considered their deaths reportable, Michaels said.
But ProPublica found the plight of workers who are injured by trains — but who are not staff members of rail companies — may be even worse.

Kenneth Ivy was working for Riceland Foods at the company’s Jonesboro, Arkansas, rail yard in November 2013 when he said he noticed a Union Pacific freight car had been placed on a slope without its brakes applied. He said he attempted to apply the brakes and they wouldn’t work. The freight car rolled over Ivy, crushing part of his left arm and both his legs, which had to be amputated.
Because Ivy didn’t work for the railroad and the accident didn’t happen on Union Pacific land, government policies dictated that Union Pacific didn’t have to report it to the FRA. Instead, Riceland Foods reported it to OSHA. So now Union Pacific’s safety record doesn’t reflect the fact that its freight car grievously injured someone, nor did the regulator with expertise in rail safety investigate whether the brakes were faulty, nor could the agency use the incident to track similar injuries or learn whether there are any systemic hazards.
Union Pacific, which denied in court that the brakes were defective, said the worker tripped when he attempted to apply them to the moving freight car. The company noted to ProPublica that it was Riceland Foods that moved the rail car and Riceland Foods that was responsible for the switch operations. While that company settled with the injured worker, so did Union Pacific.
Though rail companies must report when contractors are hurt on their land, ProPublica found they have dodged that reporting requirement, too.
Contractor James Wheeler was rigging down a boom of heavy equipment in Norfolk Southern’s rail yard when a fellow contractor’s mistake resulted in Wheeler having three fingers on his right hand amputated. Norfolk never reported it, despite the fact that the incident happened on its land. The company did not comment on the case, but said it reviewed all of the unreported cases found by ProPublica and wound up reporting one of them to the FRA, “which was based on information added to a case months after the initial report was made internally. That update was made immediately.”
FRA officials said they believed the incident should have been reported, but because the injury happened in 2016, they told ProPublica that nothing further had to be done. The FRA said the five-year limit was a reasonable time frame.
The agency says it focuses its efforts on newer injuries and that its audits are rigorous and successful. Last year, the process caught Union Pacific managers hiding nearly 100 injuries that should have been reported.
“UP documentation clearly showed these incidents were reportable injuries,” the agency said. The company disciplined those involved, the FRA said, but the agency’s investigation is still open because a key witness in the case has filed an OSHA complaint against Union Pacific and won’t speak to the FRA until given clearance by his attorney. An agency spokesperson said the FRA expects to issue violations but as of now no fines have been levied. “Allegations that managers are incentivized to hide or ignore injured employees are false,” UP told ProPublica in a statement. The company also told ProPublica that its own audit process had found the “incorrectly classified” injuries and that the company had corrected them.
Agency officials said that most of the time, when they catch unreported injuries, they simply ask officials to reconcile the matter. The agency doesn’t separately track fines it gives for injury reporting violations, instead lumping together all the fines it levies against railroads for all kinds of reporting failures. ProPublica added up these kinds of fines levied against all Class 1 companies in 2022, the most recent year of data available. For the companies, which had $108 billion in combined revenue that year, the penalties added up to $30,011.
The agency told ProPublica it knows the penalties are too paltry to prevent the companies or their officials from attempting to hide injuries. Only Congress could increase the fines, a spokesperson said. “The proposed Railway Safety Act would allow for a substantial increase in the maximum civil penalty amount,” the spokesperson said. That bill, which received bipartisan support when it was introduced on the heels of last year’s catastrophic derailment that unleashed hazardous chemicals on East Palestine, Ohio, has since stalled in Congress.
Cassity said the FRA’s audit process allows railroads too much notice before the government arrives on site to check records. “It just just doesn’t go far enough,” he said, adding that he believes companies purposefully don’t fill out certain paperwork so they can hide injuries from the FRA and that there is little the agency can do to combat the practice.
He suggested that one way to get the fullest accounting of injuries would be for the FRA to devise a system where the reports come directly from employees. “Right now, the only way to get the facts is through a carrier that, quite frankly, is not playing fairly,” he said. “And so you've got to get it from the source.”
Such a system would require significant procedural and operational changes, FRA officials said, and there is no guarantee all employees would abide by them.
But agency officials said they can entertain these and other big changes during the upcoming public comment period for their proposed rules, which have not been updated since 2010. During this period, railroad companies and labor groups are expected to provide their perspectives and could mount legal efforts to change the proposals. According to the agency, any new rules will receive final approval from its chief safety officer.

A mother and her daughter were killed on Tuesday in a tragic collision with an Amtrak train.

Passengers aboard the train traveling from San Leandro destined for Sacramento were delayed after their train collided with a car, killing 30-year-old Vanessa Henriquez and her 3-year-old daughter, Saidy.

Officials report no one onboard Amtrak Capital Corridor train 532 was injured.

The crash happened sometime after 1 p.m., according to Alameda County fire officials. Crews responded to the crash on the railroad tracks in the area of Washington Avenue and Chapman Road.",YES
644,rd_html,"The section of Hawthorne Boulevard in Rancho Palos Verdes where Tiger Woods lost control of his car Tuesday and was seriously injured in a rollover crash is known to local residents as a danger zone prone to accidents.

The crash occurred around 7 a.m. on a curvy, steep stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard near Blackhorse Road, where signs warn trucks to use lower gears when traveling downhill.

Donnie Nelson, a resident of Rolling Hills, said there are one or two serious crashes every year on the roadway.

“Most of the time,” he said, “trucks come down the hill and lose their brakes.”

Nelson said he knows of at least one person who was seriously injured by a trash truck on the hill.

The speed limit is 45 mph, but “cars fly by you here.”

Bob Fong, 67, lives on Blackhorse Road, just north of where the crash occurred.

He noticed police cars at the intersection Tuesday morning and thought, “It must have been some big celebrity that crashed.”

Fong knows how tricky the curves on the steep Hawthorne Boulevard can be — so much so that near the crash site there is a runoff lane for use in emergencies.

“It’s a heavily trafficked area. There’s accidents all the time,” said Laureen Swing, a 15-year resident of Rancho Palos Verdes. “I think it’s almost a dangerous stretch of road.”

Swing was walking her dog a block from the crash site Tuesday afternoon. She said she stays on the right side of the road when she drives there “because I’m just afraid of people wanting to go fast.”

“They don’t use turn signals sometimes when they switch lanes. I’ve almost found myself getting into an accident, trying to avoid another car cutting me off on that road. It’s pretty dangerous.”

She didn’t see Woods’ crash, but she said a van crossed the median on the same road a few years ago and nearly hit her.

Residents said that the grade going down Hawthorne is very steep and that it’s easy to lose track of your speed.

“You don’t know how fast you can descend. I’ve been ticketed not even accelerating, just using the momentum of the hill, and I was speeding,” said a 54-year resident of Rancho Palos Verdes who requested not to be named.

“If you’re not familiar with this area, it’s just really easy to go fast. I usually [avoid the Hawthorne Boulevard and Blackhorse Road intersection] because people will run the light, and I could get nailed making my left turn up here.”

Woods was in Los Angeles as the host of the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, a golf tournament that concluded Sunday. According to various reports, Woods was on the golf course for a Golf Digest photo shoot on Monday, and both retired NBA star Dwyane Wade and comedian David Spade tweeted that they were playing with him that day. Golf Digest confirmed that Woods was on his way back to the country club for an additional photo and video shoot when the crash occurred.

The PGA star had to be extricated through the windshield of the Genesis GV80 SUV he was driving, officials from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said.

He was transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center by ambulance. His injuries included a shattered ankle and two leg fractures, one of them compound, according to a source familiar with his treatment.

493,rd_html,"This week, representatives from local governments are meeting with elected officials and others in Washington, D.C. The goal? Build on recent support to see commuter rail finally come to the Coachella Valley.

Passenger rail service between Palm Springs and other parts of the Coachella Valley and downtown Los Angeles may seem like wishful thinking, but an ambitious plan to provide just that is picking up steam.

This week, representatives of some of the multiple local governments backing the Coachella Valley-San Gorgonio Pass Rail Corridor Service Project are scheduled to meet with elected officials and others in Washington, D.C. It’s the latest move forward for the project first envisioned in 1991.

The timing couldn’t be better.

“There’s a huge push with the federal infrastructure bill, and in it, there’s a lot of investment for inter-city rail, which is what this project is,” said Aaron Hake, deputy executive director of the Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC). “We want to ensure this new corridor is a part of the national conversation.”

Indio Mayor Waymond Fermon and Riverside County Supervisor Karen Spiegel, who serve on the RCTC with nearly three dozen others (including Palm Springs Mayor Lisa Middleton), plan to sit down with representatives Raul Ruiz and Ken Calvert, as well as U.S. Department of Transportation Deputy Assistant Secretary Andrew Wishnia, to discuss how to keep the project top of mind in the nation’s capital.

As currently envisioned, passengers of the rail service would be able to travel between Los Angeles and the valley, stopping at nine stations along a 144-mile route. An existing Palm Springs station could be joined by up to three new stations in the desert, including a Coachella terminus. Additional rail lines would also be needed, Hake said, in order to avoid interfering with freight transportation.

The total cost of the project is estimated to be close to $1 billion dollars. But Palm Desert Mayor Jan Harnik, who also serves on the RCTC, cautions that should be put into perspective. Those who see the price as a sticking point should consider what we’re currently paying for transportation infrastructure, she said, adding that passenger rail construction will be coming and that not acting now will only result in increased costs later.

“When you talk about that kind of money, a billion dollars sounds scary to people,” said Harnik. “But this is a tremendous project. Most people don’t think about the fact that all we are usually doing is just widening our freeways and adding more lanes. It’s terrible land use.”

Harnik is also quick to point to other benefits. The rail line is predicted to alleviate more than 107,000 vehicle trips per year – resulting in a reduction of 858,380 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. When you reduce vehicle trips and miles traveled, she said, there’s less need for road repairs and less money spent on car repairs. There’s also an increase in safety.

“We can’t afford not to do it,” said Harnik, “It’s an investment in our community and in our environment and we call benefit from it.”

Where, exactly, the additional Coachella Valley stations would be located is being discussed at the city level. Last week, the Palm Desert City Council voted unanimously to solicit proposals for a feasibility study, hoping to host the mid-valley station somewhere along the Cook Street interchange. Locating it there, city staff said, would provide access to the Cal State campus and Acrisure Arena.

“We are being proactive and looking into things that will make the decision easy for RCTC,” said Eric Ceja, Palm Desert’s director of economic development.

If and when a more viable passenger rail service arrives in the Coachella Valley, the most obvious benefit might be that it finally gives residents traveling west a viable alternative to cars. The current fastest way to travel between the valley and Los Angeles County is via Interstate 10 in an automobile or on a bus. When the freeway is shut down because of an accident or due to construction, it adds hours to the trip.

“It would be transformative,” said Harnik. She visualizes hopping on the train in Palm Desert for a meeting in Los Angeles and heading back home in time for dinner – a trip she recently made, but that required first driving to San Bernardino.

Perhaps nobody would have a more transformative experience than those who don’t own motor vehicles. For them, transportation options shrink to catching a bus, walking, or cycling. With this new rail corridor, jobs or education that seemed unattainable because of how long it would take to commute are now within reach, resulting in a boon for the economy.

“We have to connect our entire valley to opportunity,” Harnik emphasized.

Improved rail also works in reverse. The Coachella Valley’s vast tourism ecosystem would be opened to people from the Inland Empire and Los Angeles who otherwise might not want to take a day trip because of the daunting traffic. Currently, people making day trips are more than half of the visitation to the Greater Palm Springs area.

So, will the dream become a reality? Harnik and Hake both agree that there is a renewed sense of urgency to keep the project on track. It passed a significant milestone in July with the adoption of a Tier 1 environmental impact report (EIR). Next up is a Tier 2 EIR, which zooms in on the project and looks at more site-specific issues.

“Things really took off in 2016 when we applied for a grant for the Tier 1 EIR, which we just completed,” Hake explained. “The CEO and executives from Amtrak actually called the RCTC and wanted to have a meeting a few weeks ago. They’re so enthusiastic and supportive of what we’re doing.”

Part of that enthusiasm is due to the fact that our region is one of the key corridors Amtrak listed as one of its priorities for its Corridor Vision plan. In a perfect world, Coachella Valley rail would connect to Las Vegas and Phoenix.

When representatives from the RCTC told Amtrak the Tier 2 EIR could be a few years away, Harnik said they pushed for an accelerated timeline. That was part of the motivation for this week’s trip to D.C.

“We want an expedited review and the cutting of some red tape to get this done,” Hake said. “We know how transformational this will be, and we think the federal government would want to move quickly to get this done. This has more traction than it has ever had.”

Added Harnik: “We have never seen the momentum we have now.”

But while elected and appointed officials in government may feel that momentum, many taxpayers do not. The RCTC has received copious feedback about how long progress is taking and other issues surrounding what would be a monumental change in people travel.

“Some people think it’s something that’s so far off, but it’s really not,” said Hake. And even though the project fell out of the public eyes for years, the RCTC was still hard at work behind the scenes coordinating with a dizzying amount of state, county, federal, and private entities.

“We’ve been working on it this whole time,” Harnik explained, adding that officials are aware that rail won’t be a one-size-fits-all fix for transportation problems in the valley. For that reason, she said, it isn’t being considered in a vacuum.

“We have to consider all these things,” she said, “like how are people going to get to the station if they don’t have a car? What about light rail, trolleys, and shuttles through different valley cities?”

Those types of considerations may have been ushered in during the pandemic. The tide turned ever so slightly against infrastructure dominated by private vehicles as cities closed off major roads and brought dining parklets into the street. It was a moment in time where people could enjoy quieter and safer streets and envision their cities looking like that in the future.

Cities like Syracuse, Detroit, and Seoul are slowly removing busy highways and replacing them with public spaces and more people-friendly design, providing a glimpse into the future here. Palm Desert’s San Pablo road diet, Indio’s Highway 111 Specific Plan, and the valley-wide CV Link bike path prove that local government is rethinking transportation design.

Even political opponents may be coming on board. Even though Hake and others are hesitant to offer a timeline for completion of the Coachella Valley rail plan, they are optimistic it will happen, even if “Amtrak Joe” Biden is no longer in The White House.

“Different administrations can come and go, and Congress can change hands,” Hake said. “But because (the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) commits the federal government to that level of investment for a long time, the next several years are already on a set course.”",NO

Shohei Ohtani missed his start against the Oakland Athletics on Thursday night due to an incident with Oakland's public transit.
The Los Angeles Angels two-way star was originally on a team bus to RingCentral Coliseum, but a traffic accident on the Bay Bridge, which connects San Francisco and Oakland, forced the bus to turn around. Ohtani and his teammates had to find another way to get to the stadium and opted to use the public metro system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART).
But Ohtani and his teammates encountered an unconfirmed issue with BART and were so late to the coliseum that Ohtani didn't have enough time to warm up to pitch, and the Angels had to start relief pitcher Patrick Sandoval. 
Angels manager Joe Maddon said Ohtani prefers three hours of preparation before a start to feel most comfortable.
""For us, Shohei's most comfortable, he's pretty much regimented to get everything going about 4 o'clock for his start,"" Maddon said during a zoom conference with reporters. ""It exceeded that by maybe an hour, so we started calling the audible at that point to not pitch him tonight. And if we're not going to pitch him, we're going to DH him.""
The news of Ohtani's delayed arrival was initially reported by Rhett Bollinger of MLB.com. It prompted a response from the official BART Twitter account, which said the service was unaware of any such problems. 
""We did not experience any issues on our end. We confirmed with Operations Control Center there was no delay for any Coliseum-heading train during the Bay Bridge incident,"" BART's tweet read. 
 
Minutes later, BART sent a follow-up tweet saying that a social media employee who was on his way to the Coliseum hoping to see Ohtani pitch was the one who confirmed that there was no delay with the train to the coliseum.
A BART spokesperson told Insider that Ohtani and his teammates possibly got on the wrong train, and that is why they were late. 
""We have an unconfirmed report that the Angels may have boarded a train that was not on a line serving the Coliseum, and they had to transfer to a different line, which obviously takes more time than boarding a train that goes directly to the Coliseum,"" the spokesperson said. 
The spokesperson did confirm that the employee was not on the clock when he made the report and was doing so out of personal interest. 
""He has the ability to call our Operations Control Center directly to gather information about delays,"" he said. ""Although he was no longer officially working at the time, he went above and beyond the call of duty to confirm that there was no delay and to set the record straight.""
Ohtani did play in the game, but as a designated hitter, and went 0-for-3 at the plate. Sandoval threw five scoreless innings in a rare start, but the Angels lost the game 5-0 after the Athletics scored five runs in the sixth inning. 
Ohtani is now slated to pitch on Saturday night and will look to build on a historically impressive season for a two-way star. 
""BART's on-time performance percentage is in the high 90s. If Shohei wants to get to the mound on time tonight he would do well to consider taking BART,"" the BART spokesperson said.

- Share via
Anne Heche was in a coma Monday as authorities tried to piece together the chain of events days earlier that ended with the actress speeding down a Westside street, crashing into a house and suffering burns in the fire caused by the impact.
Los Angeles police are investigating Heche in connection with driving under the influence and hit-and-run after she crashed her car into a Mar Vista house Friday, igniting a fire. Heche, 53, was pulled by L.A. firefighters from the wreckage of her burned Mini Cooper.
As that investigation continued, news about Heche’s condition took a turn for the worse.
“Shortly after the accident, Anne Heche became unconscious, slipping into a coma and is in critical condition. She has a significant pulmonary injury requiring mechanical ventilation and burns that require surgical intervention,” a spokeswoman for Heche said in a statement to The Times.
Los Angeles Police Officer Annie Hernandez confirmed that detectives investigating the crash in the 1700 block of South Walgrove Avenue obtained a search warrant for the actor’s blood at the hospital to see whether she was under the influence.
Fifty-nine firefighters responded to the scene of the accident. In the moments before impact, Heche was captured on video crashing into a garage at an apartment building, then narrowly missing a pedestrian before striking a Jaguar, according to law enforcement sources and video that was made public.
David Manpearl was sitting at his desk Friday morning at his Mar Vista home when he saw a car speeding by his window.
Seconds later, he heard a loud thud.
“It took me one or two seconds to put together that the sound I heard was a crash,” he said. “I ran out the door and down the street to find out where the crash was and see if anyone needed help.”
When he arrived at the scene, he said, he found the front wall of a house missing and debris everywhere. He said Heche’s car had gone all the way through the house and was lodged in a wall in the back. He said he went inside the house and found its tenant standing in the middle of what was left of her kitchen, barefoot, asking for help with her tortoise and two dogs.
“She couldn’t move because the ceiling had come down, so there was all kinds of debris everywhere,” Manpearl said. He and another neighbor helped the neighbor to safety.
When David Manpearl arrived at the crash site, he found saw debris everywhere, a tenant asking for help and Anne Heche stuck in a car.
Trevor Colbert, who lives across the street, also ran outside after he heard the crash and saw a hole in his neighbor’s house. He said he went back inside, grabbed a fire extinguisher and returned to find his neighbor on her front lawn.
“She came out carrying one of her pets, and she seemed pretty rattled,” Colbert said. “She wasn’t really saying much. I think she was in shock.”
After making sure the tenant was safe, Manpearl said, he went back into the house to try to help Heche, who was still stuck in the car.
“It got to a point where there was fire everywhere. It was all around us,” he said. “It had spread from the car to the house and the smoke was getting thick. I kept hoping that the fire department was there, but it hadn’t come yet, and eventually I had to leave the house for my own safety.”
Heche has not been arrested or charged.
Heather Duffy Boylston, Heche’s friend and podcast partner, said in a statement: “Her family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time.”
Shortly before the crash, Heche was acting like “a sweet little girl” as she bought a bright red wig at Glass Hair Design in Venice, salon owner Richard Glass said Monday.
A half-hour before crashing into a Mar Vista home, Anne Heche stopped by a Venice hair salon to buy a bright red wig — because the blue one was taken.
The actor was “very pleasant” and seemed to be fine Friday, Glass said, when she popped into his Main Street salon through the back door wearing a strappy top, comfy pants and fluffy, plush house shoes.
He posted a selfie showing the two of them — and the wig — on his Instagram account.
“So I met @anneheche today and she purchased a #redwig so random,” Glass captioned the photo for his 3,000 followers. “I love #venicebeach #actress #director #mom #celebrity #lifestyle.”
“In one of the images TMZ posted, you can see the wig on the console,” Glass said. And indeed, the photo that many believe allegedly shows a bottle of alcohol in the car’s cup holder also shows a bit of red fringe where the wig sits on the passenger side of the center console.
Heche is best known for her work as Vicky Hudson and Marley Love in the soap opera “Another World”; she won a Daytime Emmy Award in 1991 for her work on the show. In the 1990s, her credits included the films “Donnie Brasco,” “Six Days Seven Nights” and “Return to Paradise.” More recently, she appeared in the TV series “All Rise” and “Chicago P.D.” and the movie “The Brave.”

570,rd_html,"Detectives identified 24-year-old Octavio Montano Islas as the driver of the 2014 Dodge Ram pickup that slammed into a Long Beach apartment building, killing a man and his young daughter inside.

Authorities are offering a $25,000 reward in their search for the suspect in a hit-and-run collision that killed a father and his 3-year-old daughter in Long Beach last month.

Octavio Montano Islas, 24, who remains at large, is suspected of driving the 2014 Dodge Ram pickup that slammed into an apartment building in the 6600 block of Rose Avenue on the evening of March 1, authorities said.

The crash resulted in the deaths of Jose Palacios-Gonzalez, 42, and his daughter, Samantha Palacios.

Police said Islas fled the scene on foot.

On Tuesday, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors approved a $10,000 reward at the request of Supervisor Janice Hahn. The city of Long Beach is contributing $15,000, bringing the total reward to $25,000 for “information leading to the apprehension and/or conviction” of Islas.

“The deaths of Jose and Samantha have had a devastating, lasting impact on our community,” Mayor Robert Garcia said in a statement. “We are hopeful this reward will encourage those with information to come forward, and I want to thank Supervisor Hahn for supporting these efforts as well.”

The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office has issued an arrest warrant for Islas on suspicion of two counts of felony manslaughter, one count of felony driving under the influence and one count of felony hit and run.

Anyone with information on Islas’ whereabouts or the collision is asked to contact Det. Kevin Johansen of the Long Beach Police Department at (562) 570-7355.",NO

Errors by contractors and consultants led to years of delay, damage, halted project
By Evan Symon, August 12, 2020 2:10 am
On Monday, a release of documents showed that a California High-Speed Rail and BNSF Railway bridge in Madera County has halted production due to numerous construction issues and design problems.
The Road 27 bridge, located in the town of Madera, was scheduled to have been completed in 2017 to link up the $20.4 billion Bakersfield to Merced leg of the California High-Speed Rail Project. However, steel lines that were supporting the bridge started snapping and tension strands started corroding. Engineering experts found that errors by contractors and consultants at the Sylmar-based Tutor Perini Corporation led to years of delay, with metal and steel damage halting the project since December of 2019.
According to the documents, Tutor also had to repair the steel strands twice due to the damage, with both the state of California and the freight train company BNSF reviewing further plans for the bridge. California High-Speed Rail central region Interim Director Garth Fernandez has said that Tutor, who will pay for the repair costs, is working on repairing the bridge and has expressed confidence that the bridge will be repaired soon.
However, many critics have said that the bridge, now four years behind schedule, could have more, not-yet readily apparent issues lurking beneath. Many of the issues and delays surround the high-speed line have influenced the federal government to pull some funding, such as the Department of Transportation pulling $1 billion in funding in May.
“You need to cross the T’s and dot the I’s,” explained civil engineer Dave Martin, who has worked on bridge projects in three countries. “You need to have outside counsel on this, especially after they had to already fix the bridge a few times. If you don’t have enough eyes on it, you can have an accident. It can be as simple as adding the wrong type of bolt or support, like the Kansas City walkway incident, and it can all fall down.
“For the High-Speed Rail, there’s the added pressure of urgency, as this project is years behind schedule and has gone way up in price. It was originally priced at $40 billion, but now an opening may not happen for over a decade still and is costing, by some estimates, as much as $100 billion. Any failure now for a project this size isn’t an option, by like the bridge showed, it keeps happening and costs go up.
“What we should take away from today is that the project is delayed again, costs may rise even with the firm taking any costs, and more people are getting frustrated with it. No engineer wants a white elephant, but that’s what it is looking like.”
Other high speed lines, such as an LA to Las Vegas route, are currently being moved forward by private companies.
The Road 27 bridge will remain delayed for at least the near future. The bridge, designed to carry traffic over the rail lines, is currently being suspended by temporary metal supports while repairs are delayed.
Currently there is no plan in place to finalize repairs on the bridge.

I’m so sick and tired of this GD project! I knew it was a boondoggle the second it appeared on the Ballot and the useful idiots went for it hook line and sinker. JUST GO AWAY!!!!!!!

This boondoggle is going to cost a fortune and it will never be finished. Tutor is a highly aggressive and combative contractor that had a terrible reputation for change orders.

BILLABLE TIME!!! every mistake is bigger profit for Diane Feinstein

The corrupt, incompetent #DemParty controlled CA government cannot even build a bridge.
And we want this same corrupt, incompetent #DemParty controlled CA government to have more power, money and control over our lives?
And we trust this same corrupt, incompetent #DemParty controlled CA government when it orders us to wear [useless] facemasks, close our businesses and close our churches [but allows #DemParty sanctioned riots, looting and “protests”]?

It is rare for any publicly funded project, railway, airline terminals, highways or buildings to not have massive fraud, waste, and abuse of public powers. They are never finished on time, nor a budget. It is interesting that foreign engineering firms were used. Why aren’t American firms involved? Whatever happened to Haliburton, Blackwater and other military companies that were quite capable of building things? Solutions are available if someone steps up and keeps it simple.

817,gs_html,"A Metrolink train derailed in Oxnard on Feb. 24, 2015, after colliding with a pickup truck on the tracks.

The adult children of the Metrolink engineer killed in a collision between a commuter train and a pickup have sued the regional rail agency and Union Pacific Railroad Co., alleging that negligence in the design and operation of the rail car led to their 62-year-old father’s death.

In a complaint filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Shawn and Kara Steele seek compensation for the medical care and burial of their late father, Glenn Steele, who at the time of his death was considered the most senior engineer at Metrolink.

Steele died March 3, 2015, about one week after the early morning crash in Oxnard that also left 34 people injured.

A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board released in March 2015 found that the pickup driver intended to turn onto a street but mistakenly veered onto the tracks. The truck became stuck and the train struck it, causing four of the train’s cars to go off the tracks, which are owned by Union Pacific.

In their lawsuit, Steele’s children allege that the negligent and careless design and maintenance of the train led to the accident.

“It should never have happened,” said Tony De Los Reyes, an attorney representing the Steele children. The train, he said, was “obviously” not crash-worthy.

Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said the agency was aware of the lawsuit but unable to comment because it is pending litigation.

“Our hearts go out to Glenn’s family and friends,” the statement said. “He was an experienced, hardworking and veteran railroader.”",YES

A tour bus carrying some of Josh Tuner's crew members crashed on Wednesday night (Sept. 18), following a concert in Paso Robles, Calif. One person, one of the singer's longtime sound crew members, is dead and multiple others are injured following the accident.

KSBY-TV reports that the crash occurred at about 11:45PM local time, on Highway 46 near McMillan Canyon Road in Shandon, Calif. San Luis Obispo County Sheriff deputies, San Luis Obispo fire officials and California Highway Patrol officers, all of whom responded to the scene, say the tour bus drove off the road and through 20 yards of vegetation. The bus then went down an 80-foot cliff, hitting the sand of a dry riverbed below.

The tour bus that crashed was part of a caravan of buses, all related to Turner's trek, headed to Washington State. The front end of the bus sustained major damage, and a trailer that was being towed by the bus flipped on top of the bus.

Officials report that there were eight people, including the driver, on the bus at the time of the crash. Two of them -- sound engineer David Turner and production manager Richard Lazarus -- were ejected from the bus during the crash; first responders needed to use the jaws of life to extricate one victim, and set up a rope system to rescue the bus' passengers from the riverbed.

David Turner, 64 (and no relation to Josh Turner), has been identified as the deceased crew member; he had been working with the singer since early 2006. Of the seven passengers who were injured, two suffered major injuries and five suffered moderate injuries; Richard Lazarus' friend, Jerry Slone, tells WKRN-TV that Lazarus, 56, is in the ICU with a broken back, broken legs and a cracked chest bone. Six patients were taken to local hospitals, while another -- the driver, who has been identified as 39-year-old Bradley Dratnol and sustained serious leg injuries -- was airlifted to Cottage Hospital in Fresno, Calif.

According to first responders, neither Turner nor his band members were on the tour bus. Beyond David Turner, Lazarus and Dratnol, 26-year-old Carl Hardin, 26-year-old Justin Lambert, 59-year-old John Dauphniee and and 66-year-old James Mayo are being treated for ""major to moderate"" injuries, officials report, though the specifics are unknown. Fifty-nine-year-old Jed Downing sustained only minor injuries in the crash but is also being treated at a nearby hospital.

An eyewitness to the crash reports that the tour bus was traveling approximately 60-65 miles per hour at the time of the accident, in an area in which the speed limit is 55 miles per hour. Someone on a bus following the bus that crashed says they did not see brake lights go on when the bus that crashed left the road.

CHP officials are working to determine what caused the crash, but have ruled out drugs or alcohol as a cause. They are also exploring the possibility of mechanical issues, and will be impounding the vehicle. Charges will likely be filed because of the death and injuries.

Turner was scheduled to perform in Yakima, Wash., on Friday (Sept. 20). However, according to his rep, all remaining September shows will be rescheduled for a later date.

779,tf_html," To the surprise of the public and the commission, which didn’t know the funicular would be used in La La Land, Stone and Gosling climbed aboard for a scene that depicted a romantic nighttime ride. (Source: AP)
Angels Flight, Los Angeles’ beloved little railroad, is about to start reaching for the heavens again. The funky little funicular that carried Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling to the top of downtown LA. in the movie La La Land is scheduled to reopen to the general public Thursday morning.
After a ceremonial first ride by the mayor, the transit system the city proudly calls the world’s shortest public railroad will resume doing what it first did on New Year’s Eve 1901, ferrying riders up and down the city’s stunningly steep Bunker Hill. A funicular, it operates by using the counterbalancing weights of its cars to pull one up while the other descends.
It was closed four years ago after a derailment left a handful of passengers perched precariously above a downtown street for hours. No one was hurt, but a subsequent investigation revealed numerous safety flaws and the state Public Utilities Commission shut the railway down. To the surprise of the public and the commission, which didn’t know the funicular would be used in La La Land, Stone and Gosling climbed aboard for a scene that depicted a romantic nighttime ride.

By the time the Oscar-nominated film was released last year, officials were considering plans to reopen Angels Flight. But the movie seemed to give them added incentive. While it was closed, the public had to use an adjacent steep, smelly, trash-strewn stairway. “La La Land was the last straw,” laughed local historian and preservation activist Richard Schave, “It was like, OK, we have to get a yes on this now.”
Schave and his wife, Kim Cooper, had launched a popular petition drive to reopen the railway after an ugly graffiti attack damaged its two antique rail cars in 2015. “I’m thrilled to see it back again,” said 71-year-old Los Angeles periodontist Gordon Pattison, who like countless other Los Angeles natives has countless childhood memories of taking a scenic ride along the 298-foot railway’s narrow-gauge track. “I think the first time I rode it was in my mother’s arms. In 1946,” said Pattison, who plans to ride it again on Thursday.
Round trips cost a penny when Angels Flight opened in 1901. For the next 68 years, it carried tens of millions of people from Bunker Hill’s stately Victorian mansions to popular downtown shopping areas. Round trip rides will cost $1 when service resumes, and those who use transit cards will pay just 50 cents.  The little railway was still a must-take ride for tourists and locals alike when it closed in 1969 for a decades-long redevelopment project that saw Bunker Hill’s mansions replaced by high-rise office buildings, hotels, luxury apartments and museums.
Four years after it reopened in 1996 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was closed again in 2001, however, after a failure of the counterbalancing system caused a crash that killed one rider and injured several others.  The railway finally reopened in 2010, only to be closed three years later after riders had to be rescued by firefighters.

1242,gs_url,"GLAMIS, Calif. — It has been 10 months since Maya Millete went missing from her home in Chula Vista, but the search for her remains continues.
News 8 traveled to the Glamis sand dunes the weekend of Nov. 6, where volunteers teamed up with family members to search for Maya.
The search effort concentrated on a series of desert washes east of the Glamis dunes in Imperial County.
Volunteers dug in an area near train tracks after finding evidence that something had been burned but found nothing.
When searching, they keep an eye out for clothing or bones and mark items of interest like animal bones. At one point, the smell of death led them to the carcass of deer, which had been hit by a train.
Maya's sister, Maricris Drouaillet, said the whole family camped out at Glamis four times in 2020, including the weekend before the mother of three went missing on Jan. 7.
Drouaillet said she appreciates the volunteer effort.
“To drive two hours, three hours from San Diego area all the way to come down here just to help search, so it is heartwarming,” she said.
Maya's husband Larry Millete is now in the Vista jail, held without bail as he waits to be tried on murder charges in the death of his wife.
Prosecutors believe he was driving a black Lexus SUV with a personalized license plate ""MAYLANI"" on Jan. 8, ten months ago, when he is suspected of dumping his wife's body about two and half hours away from his Chula Vista home.
In an area east of Glamis, a volunteer noticed a battery-operated wildlife camera hidden in the bushes. It is motion-activated and records video.
If you have video from one of the devices from Jan. 8, check it out. If you have dashcam video from Jan. 8, check it out.
Again, prosecutors need to know the whereabouts of Larry Millete and that black Lexus SUV on Jan. 8.
On Wednesday, Nov. 10, Drouaillet will attend a court hearing where she is seeking guardianship of Maya's three children. The kids currently are living with Larry's parents in Chula Vista.
Drouaillet vowed to keep the weekend searches going, even if she gets custody of the kids.
“I want to give them answers. I want to bring their mom home,” she said.
San Diego County probate court judge, Julia Kelety, will not allow cameras in court for Wednesday’s guardianship hearing. Members of the public will be allowed to attend in person or via remote feed on Microsoft Teams.
Larry Millete’s next hearing in his criminal case is set for Dec. 16.

788,rd_url,"Houston is a window into the future of America. In 1970, the city was an oil town that was about one-quarter black and three-quarters white, with just a smattering of folks of other origins. Since the oil-price bust of 1982, however, growth in the city and metropolitan area has come almost entirely from influxes of African, Asian, and especially Latino Americans. These new Houstonians came to work in construction and service, and as professionals in the expanding Texas Medical Center. During the same period, the white population, much of which had originally come to the region for oil jobs, hardly grew at all.
The result? What was once a “biracial Southern city,” as Rice University sociologist Stephen Klineberg put it, is now one of America’s most diverse metropolitan areas. In fact, by one measure of diversity—how evenly distributed the population is between blacks, whites, Latinos, and Asians—it beats out New York and Los Angeles. By 2060, the Census Bureau predicts the country will follow, roughly, in Houston’s footsteps, with no single race claiming a majority of the population.
What have these demographic shifts meant for Houston, and what will they do to the country? As the city’s demographic make-up shifted, so did its attitudes. Houstonians became slightly more likely to be Democrats, and slightly less likely to be Republicans. With every passing year, their support for immigrants, including the undocumented, grows. There were tensions initially because some longtime residents worried that the new immigrants wouldn’t assimilate, says Klineberg, who has lived in the city for 45 years and surveyed its residents regularly since 1982. But as a generation of United States-born children grew up, he saw those worries fade. “It’s very hard to summon up fears of perfect-English-speaking people,” he says. “We are falling in love with each other, marrying, making multiracial babies, in a way that transforms the whole experience.” It helped that Houston had plenty of land to develop, so many residents didn’t see the racial composition of their neighborhoods change drastically: Some research has shown that these type of shifts can make people less willing to pay taxes for public goods, such as infrastructure and schools.
Klineberg thinks the city’s newest residents helped it survive in the wake of the oil bust, during which more than 225,000 people lost their jobs and hundreds of Texas banks failed. Although some research indicates that diversity can reduce community trust and engagement, some economists think that ethnic diversity in cities helps make them more productive, perhaps because workers of different backgrounds have disparate ideas and skills. At least in classrooms, diversity has been shown to promote more innovative thinking. Other studies show cities with significant numbers of foreign-born residents tend to grow faster than cities without them, and to support higher average wages for native-born residents (although some people may take a pay cut). There’s even evidence that, in some cases, immigrants can help revive cities on the decline.
“If Houston had not become a magnet for the new urban growth of the last 30 years, Houston would have lost population, would have had the same fate as other major American cities that are losing their statuses as major cities because they’ve basically stopped growing for 35 years: Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Detroit,” Klineberg says. “No city has benefited from immigration more than Houston, Texas.”

694,gs_html,"Since opening in 2012, Metro's Expo Line has stood out as a rare success at time in which transit patronage has declined in Los Angeles County. But the light rail line, which runs predominantly at-grade between Downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica, is frequently forced to stop for cross traffic at 22 ungated intersections along its route. But a fix may finally be in the works, according to a motion introduced last week by Los Angeles City Councilmember Mike Bonin.

The motion, if adopted, would instruct the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to maximize signal priority for the Expo Line at street crossings and report back to the City Council within 60 days on strategies to speed end-to-end travel times and improve on-time reliability by 90 percent.

""For our light rail system...traffic signals are a significant cause of delay,"" writes Bonin. ""Because these signals do not respond in real time to trains, even a slight delay leaving the station can result in the train hitting a series of red lights, with a cascading impact on the line's operations.""

The trains, according to Bonin's motion, can carry more than 250 passengers, but frequently must sit at red lights to wait for a handful of cars to make a left turn. Metro's estimates that signal delays can delay scheduled arrival times by as much as 15 percent.

""This is neither equitable nor efficient,"" writes Bonin. ""These delays and resulting uneven train spacing have contributed to recent service issues on the Expo Line.""

One of the most problematic sections of track runs along Flower Street between USC and Downtown, where the Expo Line faces multiple street crossings and interlines with the Blue Line in its approach to Pico Station and 7th Street/Metro Center. Metro installed a crossing gate at one of the most accident-prone intersections in 2017, and has studied the possibility of grade separation the entire stretch between Washington Boulevard and Pico Station.

Some of those recent service issues on the Expo Line have resulted from a recent 25 percent reduction to peak-hour service on the Expo Line, increasing headways from six to eight minutes. But after facing a deluge of social media criticism regarding overcrowded trains, Metro has since added additional trains in the morning and evening rush hours.",NO
842,tf_url,"of its customers have gone home, Metrolink, the Los Angeles area’s commuter rail line, sends one of its passenger trains out into the night on a lonely mission. The train is mostly empty, save for a few sandbags stacked on board to approximate the weight of human cargo. There are no riders.The train’s 70-mile journey starts at a rail yard near Union Station in downtown L.A. It follows an interstate through Burbank, past a giant movie theater and the Bob Hope Airport. It whizzes by auto salvage yards on its way through San Fernando. Darkness swallows it as it clings to hillsides in the Soledad Canyon through the San Gabriel Mountains. The train climbs to an elevation of more than 3,000 feet before it emerges above a blanket of streetlights and descends into the Mojave Desert outposts of Palmdale and Lancaster.A computer aboard the locomotive has stored all of the crucial details of the long route. It knows every curve in the track, every uphill and downhill segment, every road crossing, every wayside signal, every split in the tracks. While the train is in motion, it is constantly updating its information through radio signals, cellular communications and Wi-Fi. It calculates its own position using GPS technology. It identifies when crews are working on the tracks and where. It knows whether gates at grade crossings are functioning properly. It can tell whether the signals ahead are showing red, yellow or green, or whether they are working at all. The train keeps track of its own speed, the speed limits along the track and the distance it would need in order to stop. If the engineer does not heed electronic warnings of an upcoming hazard, the train will stop itself.Metrolink’s empty train to Lancaster is testing one of the most highly anticipated and hugely controversial advances in rail safety in decades, a technology called “positive train control.” The federal government has mandated that every major freight and passenger railroad in the country start using positive train control by the end of this year. Metrolink is already using it on two of its regular passenger lines, has tested it on two more and hopes to implement it systemwide by the close of 2015.It is very likely, though, that if the Los Angeles area meets the federal deadline as planned, it will be the only region used by both freight and passenger rail to do so. There are many reasons why Metrolink and the L.A. area’s other railroads have advanced so far beyond the rest of the country, but they all come back to a single event: a horrific crash between a Metrolink commuter train and a Union Pacific freight train that killed 25 people in 2008. It was this disaster that prompted the federal mandate in the first place.Metrolink train 111, made up of a locomotive and three passenger cars, was heading north through the L.A. neighborhood of Chatsworth late on the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 12, 2008. The train’s engineer, Robert Sanchez, had been texting on his phone during the entire route, including a last message sent 22 seconds before the collision that killed him. As the Union Pacific train approached from the opposite direction, Sanchez failed to heed a signal to stop. Instead of braking to let the freight train pass on an adjacent track, train 111 traveled at 43 mph on to the same stretch of single track occupied by the Union Pacific train. The crew of the oncoming freight train, which had just cleared a tunnel and was coming around a bend, hit the emergency brakes but still struck the commuter train at a speed of 41 mph. Sanchez never slowed down.The force of the collision pushed the Metrolink locomotive 52 feet back into the 85-foot-long passenger car directly behind it. Twenty-two of the 24 passengers who died in the accident were in the first car at the time of impact. Another 135 people were injured.It was the most deadly U.S. train accident in 15 years, and it came just three years after another accident on the same line (caused by a suicidal man who parked his SUV on the tracks) killed 11 people. There were two more deaths in a 2002 collision when a freight train went through a stop signal and hit a passenger train. Not surprisingly, following the 2008 Chatsworth accident, the rail line’s safety record came under intense scrutiny.Metrolink responded by increasing training, installing inward- and outward-facing video cameras in its cabs, and replacing its passenger cars with new vehicles designed to better absorb the impact of a crash without injuring passengers. Officials credited the new cars for protecting passengers when one of its trains hit a pick-up truck on the tracks this February. Twenty-eight passengers were injured and an engineer died in the crash, but the outcome would likely have been worse without the new cars.The National Transportation Safety Board, the agency that investigates major accidents, had been calling for a federal law to require railroads to update their technology since the 1970s. Positive train control, the agency said, could have prevented both the 2002 and 2008 Metrolink accidents.There was a push for positive train control at the local level as well. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa appointed a longtime ally, Richard Katz, to the Metrolink board the day after the Chatsworth crash. Within weeks, the mayor and Los Angeles County officials started pressuring Metrolink to install positive train control and other safety measures. A little more than a year later, the Metrolink board replaced its chief executive, who had testified before Congress against a federal mandate to require the safety measure just a year prior to the accident, citing its high costs.But it was California’s U.S. senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, who forced the issue. They pushed to include a mandate for positive train control in a rail safety bill that was already moving through Congress. A little more than a month after the Chatsworth accident, President George W. Bush signed the law requiring passenger railroads and major freight railroads to install the new technology. The Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2008 specified that positive train control systems should “prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zone limits and the movement of a train through a switch left in the wrong position.” But the technology does not prevent accidents at grade crossings, in which trains collide with cars or trucks.The Metrolink board quickly committed to meeting the federal deadline, and its new CEO, John Fenton, even pushed the railroad to roll out the new system by the end of 2012, although that goal eventually proved to be too ambitious. Union Pacific, BNSF Railway and Amtrak, all of which share track in Metrolink’s 500-mile territory, committed to installing the safety system in the Los Angeles area. Metrolink was also able to secure plenty of outside money to help build its new system. Of the $211 million it obtained, 16 percent came from the federal government, 73 percent from the state of California and 11 percent from local sources.Even with all the major players committed to making positive train control work, putting it into place would be no easy task. It would require piecing together the business, technical and logistical elements of the system, often from scratch, all while trying to comply with federal rules that in some cases had not even been written yet.is invisible to the average passenger, and it mostly works as a back-up system to existing safety measures. But to function properly, it must be tied in to just about every aspect of a railroad’s operation. It is often described as a system of systems, a way to make sure the dispatchers, repair crews, engineers and the software that supports them are all on the same page.That is challenging in itself, but it gets even more complicated because the system has to work on several railroads at the same time. Metrolink trains, for example, run not only on tracks owned and operated by Metrolink itself, but on tracks belonging to Union Pacific, BNSF and a transit agency in northern San Diego County. Amtrak runs trains through the territory, and the freight carriers use not only their tracks but also those owned by Metrolink. All of the trains running in the Los Angeles area need real-time information about switches and signals along the track, no matter who owns them, and information from dispatchers from each of the railroads.One of the biggest problems for the Los Angeles railroads has been trying to find enough bandwidth on the radio spectrum to allow all the different components of the network to talk to each other. Railroads throughout the country have complained about the challenge of licensing sufficient bandwidth to carry information from trackside signals, onboard computers and central dispatching centers. But the problem is especially acute in a sprawling metropolis like Los Angeles because of the sheer volume of signals that have to be relayed and the large geographic area that has to be integrated into the same system.Metrolink tried to lease radio spectrum on its own, but that sparked a legal fight that prevented the agency from using it. It then leased spectrum from a group run by the nation’s freight railroads, which had obtained it in an effort to prepare for positive train control nationally. But Metrolink and other railroads in the Los Angeles area had to shut down the entire positive train control system for a week so their radio equipment would work better together and, in Metrolink’s case, so the rail line could increase the amount of information it could share using its existing spectrum.There have been other logistical challenges. Metrolink has just enough locomotives to service its routes, so it had to lease three locomotives from a Canadian firm while it pulled its own engines out of service for upgrades. Then there was the matter of getting the onboard software right. The original programs treated commuter trains like freight trains, because much of the original development came from the freight railroads. But the long, heavy freight trains require engineers to build speed slowly as they come out of a stop; if they take off too fast, they can snap their trains apart. Engineers on commuter trains, by comparison, floor it out of stations and slam on the brakes as they approach the next stop. Metrolink had to modify the automatic braking software so it didn’t penalize commuter rail engineers by stopping their trains prematurely. Simply keeping all of the different parts of the network on compatible software packages is a full-time job for several Metrolink employees. And everyone has to think through contingency plans in case any part of the system fails: What is the backup plan if a car skids off the road and takes out a signaling station? What if the radio fails on a locomotive?to chalk up all of Metrolink’s progress on positive train control to the public outrage that followed the Chatsworth disaster in 2008. But the agency has continued to prioritize the project long after the original leaders who pushed for it have moved on. Villaraigosa left the L.A. mayor’s office two years ago. Metrolink has had three new chief executives since Chatsworth, and board leadership, which rotates regularly, has changed several times as well. The agency is also confronting several other pressing issues, from declining ridership to accounting irregularities to balky ticket machines.James Moore, the director of the transportation engineering program at the University of Southern California, has been hired by the federal government to study Metrolink’s rollout of the positive train control system. Moore credits the agency with instilling a stronger culture of safety among its employees. “The initial champions are still in place,” he says. “The true believers, who are very knowledgeable, are still in place. When safety culture works, it’s as much bottom-up as top-down.”Keeping the freight railroads invested has been key too. Jerone Hurst, one of Metrolink’s top officials dealing with communications systems for positive train control, says the freight railroads see the Los Angeles area as a “test bed” for how to integrate the new technology in crowded urban environments. “You had a motivated commuter rail to get it done in our territory, which is a fairly complicated territory. So if you got [positive train control] done right here,” Hurst says, “this would be the model for other urban areas around the country.”Union Pacific and BNSF railroads have worked closely with Metrolink to implement positive train control in the Los Angeles area, but they are also pushing to delay the deadline for rolling it out nationally. At the federal level, the Association of American Railroads, which represents freight carriers, says the 2015 deadline is unrealistic. Freight railroads have already spent $5 billion to install positive train control, but the total cost of the upgrade would top $9 billion, the group says. The American Public Transportation Association, which represents commuter railroads, says the price tag for its members would be $2.75 billion.Katz, the Villaraigosa appointee who served as Metrolink’s chairman and is now an alternate on the board, says a major reason for the agency’s progress on positive train control was its single-minded concentration on the issue. “We made hard decisions here that safety was foundational, that safety was No. 1,” he says. “We had to delay other capital projects to do it, but we were going to do it.”Even now, more than six years after the Chatsworth accident, the Metrolink board is still adamant about the need for the new technology. The issue came up again at a recent board meeting, when the members discussed the possibility that Congress might extend the deadline for implementing positive train control past 2015. Board members emphasized that, whatever happens in Washington, they wanted trains entering the Los Angeles area to be up to speed with positive train control by the end of this year. “While we would love, for the good of humanity, that [positive train control] be installed throughout the United States,” said Shawn Nelson, the board’s chair, “we’re a regional operator. So as long as a train operator is going to come into the greater Los Angeles basin where we operate, that’s where we have our demands.”",NO
795,gs_url,"AMHERST, Ohio - One hundred years ago, three trains collided on the tracks in what is now Amherst's Sandstone Village, killing 27 people and seriously injuring 47. The tragedy created heroes, drew villains and allowed Mary Pickford, the greatest film actress of the day, to play a real-life heroine.
On March 29, to mark the anniversary of the disaster, Amherst erected a simple, somber monument to tell the story of the city's catastrophe at Sandstone Village, a recreated 1800s town on Milan Avenue.
Historian Jim Wilhelm, who also serves as the assistant fire chief of Amherst, has made it his personal mission to educate people about the tragedy.
It started with two trains headed east to Pittsburgh and ultimately New York City. The second train had been added to carry the overflow from the crowded first train, and it followed nine minutes behind it.
As the first train approached the old Amherst switching station around 3:15 a.m., the engineer stopped because a danger signal light was on. Heavy fog kept the engineer from seeing very far down the tracks. He got out to talk to the switching station worker, fearing there was a broken track or an obstacle on the tracks ahead.
""It turned out to be a bogus signal,"" Wilhelm said. ""It turned itself off before the engineer reached the tower. The engineer got back on board and tried to get the train moving again. That was the trouble, he could not get it moving from the dead stop. The wheels spun on the tracks.""
The train finally started to inch forward. The dense fog prevented the engineer on the second train from seeing that the first one was barely moving.
""He plowed right into it,"" Wilhelm said. ""The second train tore right through the two rear cars of the first train, and knocked other cars over onto the tracks.""
Minutes later, a westbound train, headed from New York to Los Angeles, crashed into the derailed trains.
Wilhelm said the sounds of the crash and the sounds of trapped victims screaming cut through the still night and could be heard for miles.
Thousands of people converged at the crash site.
Some came to render whatever assistance they could. Although 27 people were killed in the crash, a 28th died the next day of injuries, and at least 47 people were badly injured. Missing or crushed arms and legs and massive head injuries were common. Doctors, nurses and rescue workers helped the injured and transported them to nearby hospitals.
Other heroes were the workers who had the monumental task of moving hundreds of tons of twisted metal off the tracks.
Still others drawn to the scene were heartless thieves.
""It was pretty awful,"" said Wilhelm. ""People were stealing whatever they found at the crash scene. There was so much going on the police could not prevent it all. One man in Lorain actually stole a scalp that was torn from the head of one of the victims. Lorain police learned about the theft and confiscated the scalp.""
Lurid newspaper headlines shouted about victims screaming in agony and about looters stealing from the victims.
But Wilhelm likes to talk about the heroes, and there were many.
Among them was a wispy young woman of 24 named Mary Pickford, the most famous silent film actress of her time. With her was another actress, Ella Hall, who served as her understudy.
""The railroad people managed to get one engine and several cars righted and able to move,"" Wilhelm said. ""They loaded up the injured and others, and prepared to take them to the hospital in Elyria. Pickford and Hall refused to go, they wanted to stay and help the injured. In her time, Pickford was bigger than Meryl Streep is today, she was the biggest star in movies, but she chose to stay and help.""
That came as no surprise to Cari Beauchamp, who works for the Mary Pickford Foundation, a charity that spends millions to help people in need.
""She was always philanthropic,"" she said. ""She always ran toward people in need, not away. She was the founder of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, now called the Motion Picture Television Fund, that helps people in the industry. Her entire life she was concerned about the poor and the elderly.""
Beauchamp said Pickford was returning to Los Angeles after finishing the film, ""Hulda From Holland,"" which was being shot in upstate New York. Ella Hall was also a star, but not as well-known as Pickford.
Oddly enough, Pickford's role in the crash's aftermath went unnoticed by Ohio newspapers. Other newspapers, including the New York Times, wrote about her.
""Mary Pickford and Ella Hall were on board the 20th Century Limited returning from New York to their studio on the Pacific coast,"" reported the Kansas City Globe on March 30, 1916. ""They got out and worked with the injured. (They) bandaged arms, heads and legs of those being brought from the wreckage.""
Pickford, known as ""America's Sweetheart,"" was one of the last people to leave the scene, making sure that the injured were first taken away for help.
She and Hall were not the only heroic women on that train.
Mrs. Robert Hotz had just completed training as a nurse at St. Joseph Hospital Nursing School in Lorain. She was returning to Chicago after boarding in Elyria, minutes before her westbound train crashed into the other two.
""She immediately went to work,"" said Wilhelm. ""She is credited with saving eight to 10 people who would have died if not for her efforts. She put every bit of training she just learned to use that morning.""
Wilhelm has put together a 14-panel display that tells the story of the crash, its aftermath and the people involved. He will occasionally put on displays in Amherst, even taking the show to nearby cities when asked.
The monument to the train crash stands less than 75 feet from where the crash occurred, on the tracks above Sandstone Village, which was created by the Amherst Historical Society.
Watch the Amherst Historical Society's website for announcements of future showings of the display.
Any chance of putting the whole story on a web page?
""I don't think so,"" Wilhelm said as he carefully folded up the display and put the panels into a protective bag. ""I think this is something that people need to see up close, to feel what it must have been like.""",YES

The cause of the crash is still under investigation.

But Fresno Police say it appears the railroad signals were working at the time and that the train engineer applied the brakes and used the horn.

They believe the boy's mother was driving the van and simply thought she had cleared the tracks when she hadn't.

Summary

At around 13:15 hrs on Thursday 22 June 2017, a mother and her three-year-old child were travelling on a South Devon Railway train from Totnes (Riverside) to Buckfastleigh. Shortly after leaving Staverton station, while the train was travelling at about 20 mph (32 km/h), the child left his seat and went towards a toilet on the train, followed by his mother walking a short distance behind.

The child entered the toilet, and as the door opened and the child stepped through it, he fell forward because the floor was missing in the compartment he had entered. A more serious accident was only prevented by the quick reaction of the mother who grabbed the child’s arm and prevented him falling through the opening and onto the track below. The child suffered minor bruising, and both mother and child were shocked. The accident was reported immediately to the railway company, but the RAIB was not advised of what had happened until 25 June 2017.

In April 2017 the South Devon Railway had carried out a repair to this carriage. The location of the repair was difficult to gain access to and required the floor of the toilet cubicle to be removed. The railway’s management decided that the door would be secured and notices placed on the door, allowing the carriage to enter service with the toilet floor missing. The RAIB found that the method of securing the door was inadequate, so that over time the door became less secure to the extent it was possible for the child to open it. The risk associated with the absence of the toilet floor was not sufficiently appreciated nor adequately managed after the carriage was allowed to enter service. The RAIB also found that the South Devon Railway had no formal competence management assessment for staff involved in carriage maintenance. Both of these factors led to no-one detecting that the door had become unsecure.

The RAIB observed during the investigation that the South Devon Railway’s maintenance regime did not identify the extent of the deteriorating condition of the carriage structure, and the railway’s fitness to run process was not being correctly applied.

Recommendations

The RAIB has made one recommendation to the South Devon Railway to commission an independent review of the actions it has taken since the accident to address the deficiencies in its processes.

The RAIB believes that the investigation has also identified an important lesson likely to be applicable to other heritage railways, about applying appropriate standards for vehicle maintenance, to ensure that the examination regime which they have in place will identify the foreseeable deterioration of vehicles, before it reaches a stage that may affect safety.

Simon French, Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents said:

Britain’s heritage railways carry over 9 million passengers every year. People are travelling for pleasure, and they don’t expect any nasty surprises during their journey. When a mother, enjoying a happy day out with a small child, is suddenly faced with a life-threatening hazard, it is important to find out what went wrong. A door opened - and she had to grab hold of her little boy to stop him falling through a gaping hole in the floor of the carriage. Operating even a small railway involves dealing with significant risks. Carriages built sixty or more years ago need looking after to keep them both clean and welcoming, and safe for passengers to ride in. Maintenance involves inspecting the condition of the vehicle, including the hidden parts that are hard to get at, at regular, appropriate intervals. It needs to be properly planned, and backed up with prompt action when something needs fixing. In this case, the railway company took out the toilet floor, to get at and fix a leaking brake pipe. The engineers found a lot of previously undetected rust and rot, that was going to have to be dealt with. It seemed like a good idea to seal up the toilet door until the whole carriage could be got into the workshops for overhaul, but that was not easy to do securely, and the door came open. Our investigation found that the railway’s safety management system was not operating properly, and had not been reviewed for many years. A flawed management structure contributed to poor decision-making. Staff were expected to do jobs which they were not really qualified for. We have recommended an independent review of how the railway manages the safety of its operations. I hope that the rest of the Heritage Railway sector will also look carefully at this report, and take action to make sure that the same thing cannot happen on their railways.

Notes to editors",YES
774,tf_url,"The engineer of an Amtrak train that derailed from an overpass onto rush-hour traffic on Interstate 5 in DuPont, Wash., was not on his cellphone at the time of the crash, federal investigators said Friday.

“The crew was not observed to use any personal electronic devices during the time frame reviewed,” the National Traffic Safety Board said after a review of audio and video recordings inside Amtrak Cascades Train 501.



For the record: An earlier version of this article referred to questions about whether the train’s conductor had been on the phone. Questions involved the engineer.

The train left Seattle early Monday morning on its inaugural run to Portland, Ore., with seven crew members and 77 passengers aboard.

Advertisement

About 40 miles south of Seattle, in DuPont, Wash., 13 of 14 cars derailed near a bridge over Interstate 5 as the train reached speeds of 80 mph in a 30 mph zone. Several cars fell onto the freeway below, striking vehicles in rush-hour traffic. Three passengers on the train were killed and dozens were injured.

Almost immediately, there were questions as to whether the engineer had been on the phone.

It’s common practice for the NTSB to determine whether crew members may have been distracted by personal electronic devices, since it’s happened before. In Los Angeles, for instance, the the agency determined that the engineer of a Metrolink train was distracted by typing text messages on his cellphone when he ran through a red signal in 2008, smashing head-on into a Union Pacific freight train and killing 25 people.

The board’s review of the DuPont crash did not disclose what the crew was doing as the train barreled into a curve headed for a trestle around 7:45 a.m. The train was using a new, faster route that would have shaved 10 minutes off the trip. Track speed was largely around 80 mph, but a sign, visible to train crews before the abrupt curve, limited speed to 30 mph.

The NTSB said the engineer did react — just not in time.

“About six seconds prior to the derailment,” the board said, “the engineer made a comment regarding an over speed condition.” He apparently then tried to brake.

“The engineer’s actions were consistent with the application of the locomotive’s brakes just before the recording ended,” according to the report, but it said “it did not appear the engineer placed the brake handle in emergency-braking mode.”

The report concludes: “The recording ended as the locomotive was tilting and the crew was bracing for impact.”

Federal investigators say they have not yet spoken with all five members of the train crew, as several remain hospitalized. Some train cars in the scattered wreckage flipped and landed upside down while others wound up dangling from the trestle. Only the rear “pusher” locomotive was left standing on the tracks above.

Most passengers and some motorists suffered minor to major injuries, and several remain in critical condition. The three who died — all of them train buffs — have now been identified. Jim Hamre, 61, and his friend Zack Willhoite, 35, both from the Tacoma area, were riding together. They were members of All Aboard Washington, a rail enthusiasts group. Their volunteer efforts helped establish the new, faster route they died on. The third victim, Benjamin Gran, 40, of nearby Auburn, was described by a relative as “an Amtrak fan to the max.”

Many of those injured and families of some of those killed are telling their stories on GoFundMe, the online site that collects crowdfunding donations for those in need.

Bret Tomblin, Willhoite’s brother-in-law, said the Pierce County Transit employee supported his wife and mother.

“The goal of this GoFundMe is to raise money for their mortgage and bills for the next three months so we can prepare for the new normal,” Tomblin said. As of late Friday afternoon, $3,815 of a $10,000 goal had been raised.

A teen boy, meanwhile, is well on the way to his goal. The 16-year-old identified only as Timmy suffered a compressed spinal cord and other injuries in the crash, and has undergone several surgeries. More than $37,000 of a $50,000 target has been donated, his page said Friday.

Donors have given Aaron Harris, seriously injured in the crash, well beyond his requested sum: As of Friday, over $32,000 of a $4,545 goal had been pledged in his name. A family friend said all the money would go toward his recovery and to aid his family.

Amtrak has also announced that it will cover medical expenses and other costs incurred by passengers injured or killed in the crash. The rail line and the NTSB say it will likely take a year or more for the government to complete its crash investigation and compile a report.

What To Do After a Car Accident in Stockton

No one can predict a car crash or collision, but you can prepare for one. Having a car accident checklist in your glove box can help you stay calm and organized after a car crash. It can tell you what to do, what not to do, and how best to protect your rights. You aren’t alone after a serious collision. Whether you are the injured victim or the family of a killed loved one, here’s what to do after a car accident:
• Stay Calm – Stay on the scene and make sure everyone is okay. Check yourself for injuries first, and then check others. Remain calm, and do not admit fault.
• Get to a Safe Location – Move disabled vehicles to the side of the road if you can. Put your emergency flashers on to help prevent further collisions. Get somewhere safe to wait for the police.
• Call 911 – Call the police to report your accident. Unless your crash was very minor, with no injuries or property damage, you should call the cops. Police can document the incident, gather information, and make it part of an official record.
• Exchange Information – Swap names, phone numbers, and insurance information with the other driver(s) involved in the accident. If possible, take photos of the vehicles, license plates, and other vital details.
• Do Not Admit Fault – Stick only to the facts of what happened when speaking with a police officer. Be as detailed as possible in your description of the collision.
• Seek Medical Attention – Go to the hospital or your primary doctor as soon as possible. Immediate medical care can help reduce the damage you suffer from injuries. Tests and scans can identify internal injuries that may not show symptoms yet.
• Report to Your Insurance Company – Most insurers have time limits for how soon you must report an accident in California. Call quickly and follow the agent’s directions for reporting your crash.
• Speak to Insurance Adjusters – As soon as the day of your accident, you may receive a phone call from the other party’s insurance company. You may speak to the claims adjuster, but do not give away any more information than is absolutely necessary. Do not record a statement or accept an insurance settlement offer until you speak to an attorney.
• Create a File – Keep accident-related documents together and organized. Your file should include a copy of the police report, medical bills, the other driver’s information, injury treatment plans, and any other documents you’ve collected regarding the incident.
• Call Our Car Accident Lawyers – When in doubt, give us a call at (888) 488-1391. We offer free consultations so you can discuss your car crash without risk or obligation. We can determine whether your case has merit, help you talk to insurance companies, and assist you in filing a personal injury claim if necessary.

In the US, car crashes cause the most accidental deaths and injuries. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are 42,795 fatalities in 2022 alone.

The state of California saw 3,847 fatal vehicle collisions in 2020. About 59% or 2,260 fatalities resulted from accidents involving only one vehicle. A total of 1,587 deaths, or 41% of all fatalities, resulted from collisions involving two or more vehicles.

Two vehicles were involved in most collisions (72% of all collisions, 71% of collisions that caused injuries, and 77% of all injuries). Angle collisions caused the most fatalities and injuries, with roughly 8,000 in 2020.

In Stockton, 1,481 crashes either resulted in injuries or fatalities, according to the data from the Transportation Injury Mapping System in 2022. With a population of 323,884 people, it is advisable to exercise caution when driving around the city.",NO

UFC veteran Tony Ferguson was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence early Sunday after his truck struck other vehicles and rolled over in Hollywood, police said.

Ferguson, a former interim lightweight champion for the Ultimate Fighting Champtionship, was driving south on Wilcox Avenue around 1:47 a.m. when his Silverado hit at least two other vehicles and flipped over near Sunset Boulevard, the Los Angeles Police Department said.

Ferguson had passengers with him, but no injuries were reported, LAPD Officer Norma Eisenman said.

She said Ferguson allegedly refused to take a breathalyzer test at the scene and was later arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.

The UFC fighter spent part of his childhood in Oxnard before moving to Michigan, where he worked with his stepfather renovating homes for the family’s contractor business. An all-around athlete, Ferguson was an elite high school wrestler and also played baseball and football. He returned to Southern California in 2008 to train in martial arts.

He has said those life experiences contributed to his success as a fighter.

“You know what it was that I took from all that? Not quitting,” Ferguson told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. “I learned how to finesse.

628,tf_url,"The United States should not build more freeways simply because China has more. But there are several reasons why this country has a shortage of freeways. These include congestion, safety, and finance.

The Texas A&M Transportation Institute estimates that congestion in America’s 494 urban areas wasted 8.8 billion hours of travelers’ time and 3.3 billion gallons of fuel and cost $179 billion in 2017.133 In the post-pandemic world, increased numbers of people working at home will reduce morning congestion. However, one study found that telecommuters drive more miles per day than people who drive to work.134 Since they tend to do this driving in the afternoons, the number of hours of congestion in the afternoons may grow.

Safety is an issue because urban freeways are the safest of all roads to drive on, and rural freeways are the safest rural roads. Highway engineers classify roads as arterials, collectors, and local roads and streets. Freeways are arterials, but so are other major roads, generally including roads with speed limits of 45 mph or more.

In 2019, 4.5 people in the United States died in traffic accidents for every billion vehicle-miles traveled on urban freeways, while 7.9 people died per billion miles on rural freeways. Non-freeway arterials, however, are some of the most dangerous roads in the country: 14.4 people died per billion miles in urban areas and 19.8 people in rural areas in 2019. Converting 1,000 miles of urban non-freeway arterials to freeways would save about 70 lives per year, while converting 1,000 miles of rural non-freeway arterials to freeways would save about 30 lives per year.135

The financial reason to build new freeways is simple: new freeways, if located in the right places and priced properly, can pay for themselves. This is unlike high-speed rail or any passenger rail in the United States, which require both operating and capital subsidies. For the government to refuse to build new roads that can pay for themselves is to act as a monopolist with all the negative connotations that implies.

The main argument against building more roads is that such roads supposedly increase driving and so fail to relieve congestion. This argument assumes that the highway industry can generate more customers simply by building more roads, ad infinitum. That’s obviously not possible. What is true is that new transportation facilities can create economic opportunities. If people take advantage of those opportunities, it generates economic growth. Somehow, roads are demonized for doing this while rail advocates insist we run trains that are half empty.

Highway opponents argue that making cities more compact and improving transit and intercity rail service will give people access to the resources they need without as much auto travel.136 But this is a pipe dream. According to the University of Minnesota’s Accessibility Observatory, even in New York, one of the most compact urban areas with the best transit service in America, the average resident can reach four or more times as many jobs in a 60-minute-or-less auto drive as a transit trip of the same length.137

One argument against allowing more travel is that it uses energy and produces greenhouse gas emissions. But compact cities tend to be more congested cities, and that congestion wastes more fuel. According to the Department of Energy, people who live in densities of 10,000 to 25,000 people per square mile (densities found in such places as Chicago and San Francisco) drive about 16 percent fewer miles than people who live in densities of 1,000 to 2,000 people (typical of low-density suburbs). But the vehicles in the denser areas average about 17 mph while lower-density vehicles move about 26 mph. The department also says that vehicles moving at 25 mph use 25 percent less fuel per mile as vehicles moving at 15 mph.138 Thus, people living in denser areas may actually use more fuel than people in low-density areas. Since greenhouse gas emissions are proportional to petroleum fuel consumption, people in the denser areas also emit more greenhouse gases.

Aside from the arguments from anti-highway groups, the main obstacle to building new freeways or converting non-freeway arterials to freeways is an obsolete system of paying for roads. Fuel taxes made sense in 1956 because the costs of tolling were very high. Today’s electronic tolling systems are almost as economical as fuel taxes and have several major advantages.

First, fuel taxes don’t automatically adjust for inflation, and raising those taxes is always a political battle. Fuel taxes also fail to adjust for electric or other more fuel-efficient vehicles. In addition, existing fuel taxes go mainly to the states, while local governments rely heavily on property and other taxes to pay for road and street maintenance. Most importantly, fuel taxes fail to send appropriate signals to drivers about which roads are more expensive to drive on and similarly fail to send signals to highway agencies about where more road capacity may be needed.

Sending the right signals can help relieve congestion. Highways that use congestion pricing guarantee that travelers enjoy free-flowing traffic at any time of the day. Such congestion pricing should not be confused with cordon pricing, which is sometimes called congestion pricing, that simply charges a fee for crossing a line into a city or downtown area. Cordon pricing is a fundraising tool that doesn’t really relieve congestion.

If fees are set to ensure that roads don’t become congested, then roads that generate more fees than are needed to recover the costs of building and maintaining those roads send a signal that more roads could and should be built in that corridor out of the excess fees.

One way to build new freeways is to make them all toll roads. But if existing roads remain untolled, some people will avoid toll roads, thinking they can save money. A much better system would be to completely replace existing gas taxes, vehicle-registration fees, and tolls with a mileage-based user fee system. Such a system would allow all owners of roads—federal, state, county, city, or private—to charge fees to the people who use them. Oregon and other states are beginning to implement mileage-based user fees systems that protect people’s privacy even as the systems earn revenue to pay for roads.139

If Secretary Buttigieg or members of Congress want to make the United States a world leader in transportation, they should focus on highways, not high-speed rail. One way to do so would be for Congress to adjust the formula for distributing highway funds to the states to give a bonus to states that convert from fuel taxes to mileage-based user fees, provided that those user fees are dedicated to the roads.",NO

 Little seems to have changed at Paddington. The old Great Western Railway’s grand London terminus still sees a parade of High Speed Trains and Turbo DMUs plying to and from its great trainshed.
Internally, the HSTs have been refurbished but there’s little different inside the Turbos today than a passenger saw a decade ago. Outside, it’s true that the fleet now carries First Great Western’s blue livery in place of Thames Trains’ and Network SouthEast’s colours. The HSTs, too, are in FGW blue, just the latest in a line of liveries they’ve worn since privatisation.
In many ways, this lack of change summarises the railway a decade on from the terrible crash at Ladbroke Grove, 11⁄2 miles from Paddington. Ten years ago, the crash appeared to have a profound physical effect. Now it seems much less obvious. Time heals.
Ladbroke Grove remains the privatised railway’s worst accident. With 31 deaths and several hundred injuries, it prompted a public inquiry, chaired by Lord Cullen, and several weighty reports. It produced fundamental changes and accelerated key safety projects put in hand after 1997’s accident at Southall, which killed seven passengers and was also caused by a train passing a red signal.
At the Rail Safety and Standards Board, Chief Executive Len Porter comments on Ladbroke Grove and its effect: “Not a lot stayed the same. It was a bit of a turning point but I think Hatfield was more of a turning point.” (Hatfield took place a year after Ladbroke Grove and, while it only killed four people, its effects were far-reaching and eventually led to Railtrack collapsing.)
Continues Porter: “Ladbroke Grove was a complex accident, Hatfield was a huge problem for the industry.”
Porter contends that Ladbroke Grove highlighted an overall system failure involving track and train operators. It also highlighted how little the railway’s management understood safety risks.
He explains: “When Lord Cullen asked Gerald Corbett: ‘who is responsible for safety on the railway system’, after quite a long pause Gerald said: ‘Well, I suppose it’s me.’ And then, unfortunately having led with his chin, he was then asked: ‘How do you ensure that you discharge your responsibility for management of safety on the railway as chief executive of Railtrack?’ And he was roasted on that one because he couldn’t explain why. And that’s because, certainly from an engineering point of view, the railway didn’t understand how to manage its risk.”
Since then safety cases have become better understood (they were introduced after British Rail’s 1988 Clapham accident that killed 35 people) and more complex safety management systems have been introduced. These systems would have allowed Corbett to answer Cullen’s question.
Having a better understanding of where safety risks lay allowed investment to be placed for best effect in reducing these risks. This led to new trains replacing Mk 1 coaches and the introduction of TPWS (Trains Protection and Warning System) to reduce the chance of signals being passed at danger.
Porter’s deputy, Anson Jack continues: “There’s no doubt that the investment that has taken place in the industry has probably made the single biggest difference, as you look at the risks coming down. It’s new kit, and every time new kit is installed to modern standards the risks come down.”
It’s because much of this kit is unseen by passengers that they see little different at Paddington. As you accelerate westwards you’ll not see a completely new signal to replace the one passed at red on that fateful morning. You’ll not see that it’s an LED signal, and better placed for drivers to see it. You’ll probably not realise that as an LED signal it’s far less prone to failure (no bulb to blow) nor that this means it and similar LED signals elsewhere are safer because no one has to walk along the track with that spare bulb.
Also unseen is TPWS, which reduces the risk from signals passed at danger (SPADs) by applying the brakes if a train approaches a red signal too quickly or if it passes that red signal. TPWS is not a product of Ladbroke Grove, indeed the contract to deliver TPWS was signed just days after the accident, extensive testing having taken place on Thameslink (RAIL 359).
From the point of view of SPADs, one of which was the direct cause of Ladbroke Grove, the fact that today’s answer was already developed by the time of the accident points to that tragic day being a stepping stone on the route to improved rail safety rather than a turning point - despite the intense media storm that erupted after the accident and despite the comments bandied around by government of stripping Railtrack of its safety responsibilities.
Not all railway staff are well-placed to see the difference caused by their industry’s greater understanding of risk. Traincrew certainly have, as new stock has entered service. Drivers’ cabs are designed with ergonomics in mind (there is still more work to be done here, such as fitting air-conditioning to Class 66s), while more work is needed to examine the effects of fatigue, training to improve communications with signallers, and more use of simulators to practice procedures and assess competence.
Signallers, too, see differences. As with drivers, there’s more monitoring and work to assess competence. For track staff, there’s more automation and real-time monitoring of the track. 
Porter admits there’s a gap
between top level safety management and what happens at ground level: “Interestingly, the person on the ground wouldn’t see it specifically or immediately in what he was doing, because he would still be doing the same work. But the work programmed, the maintenance management system, would cause him to be doing things organised in a different way. So you’d be doing the same work, but the way the maintenance was prioritised would be different.”
It was Ladbroke Grove and reports from Lord Cullen that provided another burst of
momentum in changing the way risk is managed. Cullen had the railway move from prescriptive rules and procedures towards thinking about risks and working to control them. 
In many ways this was a difficult change. No longer could a set of rules be followed. In their place came the need to fully understand what was happening and think about how to reduce risks on a case-by-case basis. 
Closer to ground level, and away from boardrooms and offices, prescriptive rules still held sway. Contained in the railway’s bulky Rule Book are lists of dos and don’ts. This is now to change. The Rule Book is being rewritten in what Porter describes as a huge project - “a root and branch review”.
He says: “I think the industry has recognised that it’s just not appropriate to pile up more and more paperwork in the direction of your average guy on the ground. The objective is to change the rule book considerably. It will be smaller. It will be lighter. And it will give people direction as to what they need to do without actually telling them ‘you must do this’ by rote. So, just because the rule book doesn’t say ‘you have to do it like this’ doesn’t mean you can’t do it. 
“That is going to mean that your average person on the ground, working on the track, for example, will have to be more competent. This is a competence-based approach so we will have to say to people ‘we will give you more training, we will give you more help, we’re going to try and improve your competence so that you can take some of these decisions on your own. You know best how to produce a safe system of work. We will give you some generic high-level rules and then you work it out from there’.”
This change will be as fundamental and as difficult as the change to safety cases has already been. It provides for safety to be closely tailored to each situation. It holds out the hope that some work can be done more cheaply, but points also to other work being more expensive (all depending on the circumstances) and will bring a considerable burden to those planning trackside work, for example. 
Coupled with Network Rail’s moves towards increasingly automatic inspection techniques and mechanised plant for maintenance and renewals, it will likely lead to fewer but more highly-skilled staff working on the tracks. 
 
No SPAD fatalities
“Since Ladbroke Grove there hasn’t been an accident as a result of a SPAD. There hasn’t been a single fatality or serious injury. I think that’s a key statistic,” says Porter.
Expanding on this theme into more general railway safety, he is keen to compare Britain’s performance with that of railways overseas.
“We all think - certainly the general public often think - that the European administrations are perhaps better than GB rail for whatever reason. While we at RSSB have a great deal of respect for our European counterparts, the bottom line is that safety performance in GB is better than France or Spain or Germany. 
“If you go back and research where the major accidents have been that have been the fault of the railway, they’ve been in Italy, in France and in Germany. So GB rail is not performing badly. I think as an industry we don’t often get, or try to get, those points across to the general public. I wonder even sometimes whether our own rail sector realises it.” 
At this point, Jack quickly jumps in: “But we don’t want to be complacent.” He cites the collision between a passenger and freight train in Los Angeles in September 2008 in which more than 20 people died. The investigation found that the passenger driver had passed a signal at danger while texting on a mobile. Jack says it made Britain’s rail industry wonder whether it was doing enough to prevent mobile phones being a distraction, especially as most train operators give one to their drivers.
In the decade since Ladbroke Grove, the risks associated with SPADs have fallen by 85%, although RSSB openly admits that still leaves 15%. Much of the reduction has come from TPWS that was being rolled out even as Ladbroke Grove’s accident took place. Improvements have also come from better signal sighting, better investigations (all serious SPADs are investigated) and better training.
Just as Los Angeles demonstrated how risks today can differ from risks yesterday, so serious SPADs can still take place, as the near miss at Didcot in August 2007 showed (see panel). 
Porter comments: “Potentially high-risk SPADs do still occur. Given that you have 20,000 signals, there are still about 18 of those high-risk SPADs a year. That is the 15% we still have to manage.” 
Didcot makes clear Anson Jack’s point when he says: “We all know that TPWS does not eradicate the risks. The Government and the Health and Safety Executive looked at installing ERTMS to do that and the balance of costs versus the benefits was hugely out of proportion. ERTMS is now purely a business case-driven thing and will take 40 years to install.”
His next point gives a good example of the railway industry not simply completing a project, in this case TPWS, but continuing to look at improvements and risks. “The industry now recognises that TPWS is going to be with us for much longer than originally expected and, as we sit here, work is going on to identify what steps the industry needs to take to manage and nurture TPWS, given that it’s a long-life system not a short-life system.”
A glance at RSSB’s busy graph showing how railway safety risks have changed over the past decade makes clear the reduction in SPAD risk. It also clearly shows what risks remain. Porter comments: “SPADs were once the primary risk. As that risk dropped, others came through as primary risks, which is why level crossings are now the primary risk. Of course, the risk with level crossings is from pedestrian and road user abuse.”
In this, he echoes an powerful statement from Jack, who says: “Of the recent accidents that have happened in this country, Ufton and Heck were both accidents where the road sector strayed into the railway environment and caused loss of life for passengers. Since Ladbroke Grove, road users have caused more deaths on the railway than the railways have.” 
Level crossings, and foot crossings, occupy the strange position of being the railway’s biggest risk and yet one of the road sector’s smallest risks. The result is that while rail is keen to act, local councils (responsible for local roads) have far more pressing problems. 
Yet level crossing accidents attract headlines. In RAIL 627 we reported the death of an elderly car driver in Wales and a young child near Peterborough in two crossing accidents, and newspapers in the Salisbury area have reported a car out of control and landing on a railway, to be hit be a train, as a railway accident rather than the road accident.
So does this leave Cullen’s reports on the shelf, having served their time and purpose? Porter isn’t convinced: “I would hesitate to say Cullen is part of the archive. It is part of the archive - I’ve archived it from my files because I think we’ve moved on - but there are occasionally times when you need to remind people that that was a pretty serious incident and if this thing has been done it’s been done for these reasons. We still refer back to issues surrounding Hatfield and Ladbroke Grove from time to time.”
For Jack, Cullen is not so much about tomorrow’s railway as part of the foundation of today’s. And like many foundations, it’s hidden from view and largely outside daily thoughts. 
“In the event of anything happening, no one would want to be in the situation where they were seen to have gone in the opposite direction from a Cullen recommendation unless they had gone through a good process to work out that that was the right thing to do,” he summarises.
Plenty has been learned over the past decade and it leads Len Porter to say: “Wherever we look at the moment risk is low - very low,” before adding: “The railway has a very good story to tell.”

1102,gs_url,"45 years ago today: Farrell’s plane crash shocks Sacramento
Editor’s note: The Sacramento Bee’s Allen Pierleoni wrote this Sept. 24, 2012, story about the 40th anniversary of the fatal airplane crash into Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlour:
On a humid Sunday afternoon, Sacramento Firefighters Pipes and Drums played “Amazing Grace” as 23 white doves were released into the air.
They commemorated the adults and children killed 40 years ago when a jet taking off from Sacramento Executive Airport across the street crashed into Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlour.
Shortly before the doves’ release, speakers addressed 200 people – including survivors and relatives of those killed – who had gathered in a parking lot at the Sacramento Public Safety Center off Freeport Boulevard.
The five speakers delivered emotional words of hope and faith at the tearful anniversary observance of one of the most horrific disasters in Sacramento history.
One of them was Kerri Francis McCluskey, whose twin sister, Kristi Francis, was killed Sept. 24, 1972, when a jet careened off Runway 30 and crashed into Farrell’s.
The twins were almost 4 at the time, visiting from Stockton. They were inside the parlor with their young baby-sitter’s family. Kristi was killed; Kerri suffered a broken leg.
McCluskey led the drive for a memorial rose garden, with its two metal benches, stone obelisk fountain, concrete marker and two metal plaques with the names of those killed. It was dedicated March 15, 2003, “in loving memory” of the deceased.
The main memorial plaque bears a quote from McCluskey: “Believe with the heart of a child; find courage, comfort and strength there.”
“I took on the city in 2002,” she said before Sunday’s service. “After a year of phone calls, pavement-pounding and fundraising, the community finally came together.”
The main plaque also has four angels on it, drawn by McCluskey’s daughter, Kristin, when she was 4, and molded into the metal. Kristin is 15 now and was with her mother Sunday.
McCluskey lives in Sonora and is the counselor at the same elementary school she attended as a child after her family moved from Stockton. It overlooks the cemetery where her twin is buried.
“I’ve taken what I’ve dealt with and (used it to) help children for the last 20 years,” she said. “There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t miss my sister, but there is still a wonderful life to live and joy to find.
“That’s how I’ve tried to make sense of it,” she said. “It could have been me who died just as easily, but I was left behind for a reason. Being a twin, I feel like I need to live double to make up for the time Kristi didn’t have with us.”
The moment of impact
Around 4:30 p.m. on that Sunday 40 years ago, 12 children and 10 adults were killed, and 25 other people were injured, when the 16,000- pound gold, blue and white Korean War-era F-86 Sabre jet was unable to get airborne and careened out of control, crashing into Farrell's in the Crossroads shopping center.
The pilot was trying to leave for the jet’s home base after the weekend Golden West Sport Aviation Show at Executive Airport, on Runway 30 directly in line with the ice cream parlor.
The jet left the runway at 150 mph, ricocheted off a berm and through a fence, skidded across Freeport Boulevard and crashed into Farrell’s.
Hearing the explosion and seeing the fireball, a woman became the 23rd victim when she was struck and killed by a car as she frantically dashed across the street toward the parlor, believing her grandchildren were inside. They were not.
The pilot, Richard Bingham of Novato, suffered a broken leg and broken arm.
Among other things, the tragedy resulted in an improved land-use plan for the surrounding area. The Crossroads center was replaced by the Sacramento Public Safety Center in 2002. Runway 30 is still in use. The memorial park is situated where Farrell’s front door used to be.
Among the attendees Sunday was Lynn Mehren, whose daughter, Nancy Ann Rodriguez, was 8 when she was killed in the tragedy.
Mehren was home; her daughter had gone to the parlor with friends.
“I’ve had to (focus on) celebrating Nancy’s life that we did have together,” Mehren said. “She was one of the happiest little girls you could ever imagine.
“For 30 years, I wasn’t able to even come near this part of town,” she said. “When I finally came to the memorial (10 years ago), it was like a release.”
Sitting in chairs in the shade of a tent were Lisa Guillen and her mother, Shirley Vandiver. They were inside Farrell’s when hell came to earth.
“Lisa was 9. It was her birthday and she had invited two girls from the neighborhood to have ice cream,” Vandiver said. “(We were leaving) when there was a god-awful noise. A young woman (employee) said, ‘You'd better get outside because something blew up in the kitchen.’ There was a lot of smoke and noise, and we left. I didn’t pay the bill; it didn’t seem important. I still have it.”
“We were the first ones out of the building, but I remember seeing the wall of mirrors come crashing down,” Guillen said. “I don’t think it really dawned on me (until later) how lucky we really were.”
Retired firefighter Bob Fallon was also at the Sunday service. He was aboard Engine No. 13, the first firetruck on the scene 40 years ago.
“When we got there, survivors had pulled some people out, and we helped pull out the rest,” he recalled. “It was a grisly scene, a lot of smoke and fire. I’d never seen anything like it before, and nothing like it since.”
Tragedy raised burn awareness
One of the positive things to emerge in the aftermath was the Firefighters Burn Institute.
Sacramento firefighters had been trying to establish a burn-treatment center prior to it, but couldn’t get traction.
As victims were removed from Farrell’s and taken to hospitals, it became agonizingly clear that Sacramento lacked sufficient burn-treatment facilities to deal with such a catastrophe.
Soon afterward, Sacramento Fire Department Capt. Cliff Haskell and Firefighters Local 522 went on a fund-raising mission. The institute was dedicated on Dec. 21, 1973.
“The community needed it because there were no hospital beds available for burn (treatment) at that time, and we firefighters needed it for ourselves, too,” said Haskell.
Though the institute has functioned as a “living memorial” to those who perished, its impact has extended beyond the city.
“The comprehensive burn care and advanced research we are doing is enhancing the quality of life for burn survivors throughout the world,” said Dr. David Greenhalgh, chief of staff for burn surgery at Shriners Hospitals for Children Northern California and chief of the burn division at neighboring UC Davis Medical Center.
“We are a charitable institution that works closely with Shriners Hospitals for Children and UC Davis Medical Center,” said Jim Doucette, executive director of the institute. “We fund a lot of the continuing education and medical research for the staffs of both hospitals. Also, we have camps for burn-survival children, and a support group and retreat for adult burn survivors.”
In its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board’s formal report blamed the crash on “inadequate pilot proficiency in the aircraft,” citing Bingham’s lack of training in an older plane and his unfamiliarity with Executive Airport.
The report also cited the shortness of Runway 30 and suggested the airport's cluttered environment “could result in a sense of urgency about becoming airborne as soon as possible.”
Bingham is 77 now and lives in Shasta County. Like everyone else associated with the Farrell's crash, Bingham has lived with the tragedy every day for 40 years.
Reached by phone at his home and offered the opportunity to express himself, Bingham said, “It doesn't make me feel any better at all to talk about it. I would just as soon decline that.”

The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office said that the shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. Friday at the Chaboya Bus Yard. The victim, Regulus ""Reggie"" Teotico, and the gunman, Duc Minh Bui, 33, were both VTA bus operators.

Teotico, who had worked for the transit agency for 10 years, and Bui engaged in the same activities outside of work, according to Captain Sugey Jaimez.

""We believe the motive had to do with money owed between the two from their betting activities which had nothing to do with their employment,"" Jaimez said.

Teotico was found with multiple gunshot wounds near his vehicle in the bus yard's employee parking lot. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Bui was arrested at his home on Sunday. He faces a charge of first-degree murder.

Teotico is survived by two teenage children. He was remembered as hardworking and well-liked.

Keana Grey was heading to jury duty in Los Angeles before dawn Tuesday, sitting in the lower deck of the second Metrolink car from the front, when she felt the train shake.

UPDATE: Driver apparently drove truck on tracks before Metrolink crash, NTSB says

Looking out the window, the 19-year-old Oxnard woman thought she was dreaming: Just a few yards in front of her, the front train car was turning around.

FOR THE RECORD, Feb. 24, 9:25 p.m.: An earlier version of this report incorrectly said the train’s conductor first saw the truck on the railroad tracks and pulled the emergency brake. It was the train’s engineer.

“No, no, no,” she thought. “This can’t be happening.”

Around her, the lights went out, and she felt a sharp jostling. “We were knocked out of our seats about a foot or more, into the air,” Grey said.

The car fell onto its left side, and she heard groaning. She heard a man behind her ask, “Is everyone all right? Can everyone walk?”

He led her by the hand out of the car, even as workers from nearby pepper and strawberry fields rushed up to help other passengers.

Twenty-eight people were injured, four of them critically, but no one was killed when the five-car Metrolink commuter train — en route from Ventura County to downtown Los Angeles — struck a truck on the tracks in Oxnard and derailed.

The truck driver, whom police identified as Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Ariz., had driven his 2005 Ford F-450 about 80 feet west of the rail crossing, National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said late Tuesday. It’s unknown how long the truck, which was pulling a trailer, was on the tracks or if it had become stuck, Sumwalt said.

After the collision, the truck was pushed through the grade crossing, a total distance of about 300 feet, Sumwalt said.

Police said they found Sanchez-Ramirez about a mile and a half from the crash, and arrested him on suspicion of felony hit-and-run involving multiple injuries.

Sanchez-Ramirez’s wife, Lucila Sanchez, told The Times that he jumped out of the truck when he saw the train approaching and couldn’t restart his engine. “It’s not his fault,” she said.

The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals with broken bones, back and neck injuries, and head trauma.

The Metrolink train was moving at 79 mph near the 5th Street and Rice Avenue crossing about 5:40 a.m., authorities said, when the train conductor, who was in the first car, saw a truck stopped on the tracks. The conductor pulled the emergency brake but could not stop in time.

Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said it takes between a quarter-mile and a half-mile to stop a train with five cars. The train struck the truck and derailed, and four of its five cars went onto the gravel and street.

Lustgarten said the crash was recorded by cameras on board the train. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.

“We support the NTSB’s investigation, and this is theirs to look into,” Lustgarten said.

Nine of the patients injured in the derailment were rushed to Ventura County Medical Center, including the engineer. Bryan Wong, the hospital’s chief medical officer, said the engineer suffered injuries to the chest involving his lungs and heart and was conscious when he arrived.

“Really, the next 24 to 48 hours will give us the best sense of how he will recover from his injuries,” Wong said. “Certainly our hope is that his body rallies and his heart and lungs start to turn the corner.”

Police said the truck driver was taken to the hospital for observation, and was cooperating with the investigation. “He was very distressed,” said Oxnard police Assistant Chief Jason Benites.

Metrolink passenger Joel Bingham, 44, was heading to work in Chatsworth in the second car from the front. He was looking out the window when he saw the truck blow up.

“It was like the movies,” Bingham said. “It exploded when I went by.”

The Ventura man felt the train run off the rails. Then the lights went out and “everything started flying,” he said. He held onto a pole, and felt like a flag being whipped around. “It seemed like forever to come to a stop. It seemed like slow motion.”

Inside and outside the train, it was dark, and he could smell smoke and fire. “I just went into rescue mode,” Bingham said.

He said that about a dozen people were in his car. He said he told people to come to his voice, to escape through a safety window he had opened.

There were two women with broken arms, he said, and one with a broken shoulder.

Ted Maloney, 59, of Oxnard said he was driving to work near the crossing when he heard the Metrolink horn blaring.

“He just laid into the horn,” Maloney said. “I looked up and it was just a horrendous ball of fire.”

Maloney drove off the road and sat in his car for a few seconds, staring at the fire. He decided to help. As he ran toward two train cars flipped on their sides, he was met by two farm workers from a nearby strawberry field.

They helped Maloney, who has an artificial knee, climb into one of the trains.

Inside the train car, he saw a few passengers walking around in “a daze,” but most of them were sprawled on the floor. Purses, lunch sacks, laptops and boxes were strewn throughout the train car.

Maloney couldn’t find a first aid kit, so he grabbed a sweater, placed it under her head and held her hand.

“She called me an angel,” he said. “I said ‘No, I am just here to help you.’”

For the next 15 minutes, Maloney talked to the woman, who had been headed to work in downtown Los Angeles. He tried to keep her mind off her injuries. He said she seemed to have head, neck and back trauma.

He gathered her purse and slid it under her arm. He placed her laptop and other belongings next to her. Firefighters arrived and took over.

“It seemed like an eternity,” Maloney said.

Maloney has been in a bus wreck, traffic collision and plane crash.

“I can’t believe I even did what I did,” he said. “People needed help. I did what anybody else would do.”

The Metrolink train was equipped with new Rotem passenger cars designed to maximize passenger safety.

“The injuries came from people being tossed around,” said Keith Millhouse, a Metrolink board member. “The Rotem cars received very minor damage. They performed the way they should in terms of collision absorption. This could have been tremendously worse without them.”

The crossing, which is controlled by Union Pacific, has flashing lights, bells and arms that drop when the train is a quarter-mile away.

Two neighbors told The Times that the safety arms at the crossing don’t drop when a train is coming.

But Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said, “All indications are that, at the point of the incident, everything at the crossing including the gate arms and emergency notifications and bells were working properly.”

901,rd_url,"Tom McNamara, Blueprint America
The Monday Metro accident in Washington, D.C., when a train car rear-ended another killing nine people, involved some of the oldest cars in the city’s young subway system. The cars had already been said to have vulnerabilities. Washington, however, is not the exception for using equipment that is outdated.
Earlier this year, in a two-part report on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Blueprint America reported on the financial state of America’s mass transit systems, and focused on Washington, D.C.
[sorry, this video no longer available]
More than a third of the equipment in the nation’s seven largest rail transit agencies, according to a recent report by the Federal Transit Administration, is rated in marginal or poor condition.
Still, it has yet to be determined if the old age of the Metro cars in Monday’s crash caused the accident.
Nationally, according to The New York Times, “Replacing all the equipment that has exceeded its useful life and finishing all outstanding station rehabilitations for just those seven large systems would cost roughly $50 billion, the agency estimated, and keeping the systems in a state of good repair after that would cost an estimated $5.9 billion a year.”
The stimulus law passed in February only contains $8.4 billion for transit capital improvements across the nation. That said, the recently introduced transportation bill will dedicate more funding than ever for transit. The Obama Administration, however, wants to delay that funding increase for at least 18-months.
Washington transit officials said they could not afford to replace the outdated cars, which make up more than a quarter of their system. Moreover, due to the terms of a complicated tax shelter, the city is obliged to keep like-cars in service until 2014.
The New York Times goes on to say, “Paying for capital improvements has been a struggle for many agencies. Although federal financing for capital improvements to transit systems has been rising, the share going to the largest systems has been shrinking as they have had to compete with new, smaller systems. So while the nation’s seven largest systems — in New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, New Jersey and San Francisco — carry 80 percent of the nation’s rail riders, and are in many cases among the oldest systems, they have received only 23 percent of federal financing eligible for bringing systems into a state of good repair, according to the transit administration.”
The following is a breakdown of how mass transit is funded federally:
[Transit Capital Assistance] [Fixed Guideway (Rail) Infrastructure Investment] [Capital Investment Grants] [Federal Transit Administration Formulas]
$8.4 billion total in stimulus spending for mass transit |
|
|---|---|
| TRANSIT CAPITAL ASSISTANCE | |
| $6.9 billion | The stimulus bill provides $6,900,000,000 instead of $8,400,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and $7,500,000,000 as proposed by the House.
In addition, mass transit funding in the stimulus bill provides 2.5 percent of the rural funds for tribal transit needs and includes $100,000,000 (instead of $200,000,000 as proposed by the Senate) for discretionary grants to public transit agencies for capital investments that will assist in reducing the energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions of their public transit agencies. |
| FIXED GUIDEWAY (RAIL) INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT | |
| $750 million | The stimulus bill provides $750,000,000 instead of $2,000,000,000 as proposed by the House. The Senate did not include a similar provision.
|
| CAPITAL INVESTMENT GRANTS | |
| $750 million | The stimulus bill provides $750,000,000 instead of $2,500,000,000 as proposed by the House. The Senate did not include a similar provision.
|
| FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION (FTA) FORMULAS |
|
| Urbanized Formula | the formula: Primarily, the urbanized formula is based on population and population density. An urbanized area, accordingly, is an incorporated area with a population of 50,000 or more.For areas of 50,000 to 199,999 in population, the formula is based solely on population and population density. The funds are apportioned to the Governor of each state for distribution.For areas with populations of 200,000 or more, the formula is based on not just population and population density but also a combination of bus revenue vehicle miles, bus passenger miles, fixed guideway revenue vehicle miles, and fixed guideway route miles. Funds are not apportioned to a Governor but rather go directly to a designated recipient selected locally (most often, a responsible local official or operator of a public transit service) to apply for and receive federal funds.
A few areas under 200,000 in population have been designated as transportation management areas and receive funding directly. eligible purposes: Federal funding according to the Urbanized Formula can be used for planning, engineering design and evaluation of transit projects and other technical transportation-related studies; capital investments in bus and bus-related activities such as replacement of buses, overhaul of buses, rebuilding of buses, crime prevention and security equipment and construction of maintenance and passenger facilities; and capital investments in new and existing fixed guideway systems including rolling stock, overhaul and rebuilding of vehicles, track, signals, communications, and computer hardware and software. All preventive maintenance and some Americans with Disabilities Act complementary paratransit service costs are considered capital costs. the match: The federal share of a mass transit project cannot exceed 80 percent of the net project cost. Exceptions: The federal share may be 90 percent for the cost of vehicle-related equipment needed to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Clean Air Act; The federal share may be 90 percent for projects related to bicycles. The federal share cannot exceed 50 percent of the net project cost of operating assistance. funding availability: Year appropriated plus three years (total of four years). |
| Rural Formula | the formula: Only for areas less than 50,000 in population, the Rural Formula is based on nonurbanized population and land area. The breakdown: 80 percent of the formula is determined by the nonurbanized population of a state; 20 percent of the formula is based on land area – no State can receive more than 5 percent of the amount apportioned for land area.
The FTA also adds amounts based on the nonurbanized population according to the Growing States Formula. Eligible recipients are state and local governments, Indian tribes, non-profit organizations and public transit operators. eligible purposes: Funds may be used for capital, operating, and administrative purposes. The amount that a state can use for administration, planning, and technical assistance is limited to 15 percent of the annual apportionment. States must spend 15 percent of the apportionment to support rural intercity bus service unless the Governor certifies, after consultation with affected intercity bus providers, that the intercity bus needs of the state are sufficient. the match: The federal share for capital and project administration is 80 percent. Exceptions: The federal share may be 90 percent only if it is needed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Clean Air Act or bicycle access projects. The maximum federal share for operating assistance is 50 percent of the net operating costs. funding availability: Year appropriated plus two years (total of three years). |
| Growing States and High Density Formula | The formula establishes new factors to distribute funds to the urbanized area formula and rural formula programs.One-half of the funds that are made available under the Growing States factors are apportioned by a formula based on state population forecasts for 15 years beyond the most recent census; amounts apportioned for each state are then distributed between urbanized areas and rural areas based on the ratio of urban/rural population within each state.
The High Density States factors distribute the other half of the funds to states with population densities over 370 persons per square mile. These funds are apportioned only to urbanized areas within those states. |

499,gs_url,"Migrants maimed by ‘The Beast’: Riding the rails in search of a new life
Violence and misery forced them from their homes. Risking everything, they climbed aboard the infamous freight train that ferries the undocumented through Mexico to the US — a journey that cost them their limbs and their hopes. Now, with the help of prosthetics, they are working to rebuild their lives
The only thing Santiago Álvarez remembers is the fit of laughter that struck him as “The Beast” passed just inches above his head. He didn’t feel pain. Or fear. He was nervous, he says, and the only thing he could do was laugh. He had fallen under the train and was stuck between the tracks, pinned to the ground as the clanging steel of the rail cars raced overhead. He waited for the train to pass. “It made me feel small and skinny, the tracks are so wide,” he says. When he looked up and saw the back of the rear engine a few meters away, he thought: “If I run, I can catch it.” Then came the worst seconds of his life. He tried to get up but a terrible pain tore him apart. He looked down at his right leg: it was broken and mangled, crushed under the churning steel of La Bestia – the train that carries thousands of Central American migrants through Mexico each year, leaving many dead and many more injured. Santiago blacked out.
Santiago tells the story sitting on a plastic chair at his home in Matapalo, a community in Honduras’s Choluteca department, near the Nicaraguan border. It’s a small, dusty town with narrow dirt streets, where cows, pigs, and chickens roam freely and emaciated dogs lounge in the shade to escape the midday heat, which is humid and suffocating. Santiago is a reserved man, perhaps a bit standoffish, and like many of Central America’s rural inhabitants speaks in slow, careful sentences, heavy on the monosyllables and punctuated with distrustful looks. As he talks, he rolls up his right pant leg to reveal the damage: his mangled leg has been replaced with a prosthetic.
The accident happened in 2004. Santiago had decided to migrate to the US after his cousins told him they had decided to leave Honduras – a country consumed by violence, corruption, and an apathetic and self-serving political class. “I said: I’ll give it a shot, and we’ll see what God has to say,” he remembers. Santiago and his cousins travelled north through Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas, almost without a hitch. In the eastern state of Veracruz, they got on the freight train. It was August 2. “We were happy because now we were on top,” he says. Migrants ride on the roofs of the freight cars, jumping on when the train slows down enough for them to run alongside and swing themselves up. The plan was going well, until the train stopped at a crossing and some men with machetes climbed on top of the train. Thieves, preying on migrants. As the metal cars clanged to a start and began to pick up speed, the assailants ran along the top, jumping from car to car, chasing migrants and brandishing machetes. Santiago didn’t realize what was happening until he heard the screams of a young man being hacked in the back by the attackers. “I panicked and ran. A guy was chasing me. He was right behind me. I managed to jump between two sets of cars, but when I turned to look back, he was even closer. It was in that moment, when I turned to look back, that I went down, and fell down between the rails,” he recalls. It was two o’clock in the afternoon and a light rain was falling. “That’s when the dream ended,” Santiago says.
It’s the same dream that thousands try to make a reality every year. The figures from Mexico’s Interior Ministry speak for themselves: between 2013 and 2019, more than 820,000 undocumented Central American migrants were apprehended by Mexican authorities. Like Santiago, their hopes were dashed, either because they were captured and deported by Mexican immigration, killed or injured by criminal gangs, abused or left to die by coyotes, or suffered some other injury during their journey – or, as is too often the case, because they simply disappeared without a trace.
Santiago’s family in Matapalo thought that he was dead, because that’s what his cousins, who eventually made it to the US, had told them. Santiago recalls what happened next with an air of bitterness, his face twisted and tense: He woke up in a hospital in Veracruz, but he couldn’t remember how he had gotten there. “I only remember that I saw a person grab me, I think it was God who grabbed me,” he says. When he woke up in the hospital, his leg was gone. “I felt helpless. For me, it was like my life was over. I felt like I was no longer good for anything, I was no longer worth anything.” He was eventually transferred from the hospital to a shelter for migrants, where he met others who were recovering from similar injuries. A month later, he was back with his family in Honduras.
Sitting in the entryway of his home in Matapalo, Santiago recounts a series of spiraling tragedies: After returning home, he decided to go back to Mexico in search of a prosthesis, which he eventually found, thanks to the support of a human rights organization. He would up in Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexico-US border, where he was assaulted, along with some companions, by a group of men from Los Zetas, one of Mexico’s most dangerous and bloodthirsty criminal gangs. “Those fuckers pulled us out of the car we were in, beat us and poured gasoline on us,” he says. “They were saying they were gonna set us on fire, but they couldn’t find any matches, so they just beat us with the butts of their guns.” After recovering in a local hospital, Santiago decided to attempt to cross the Río Bravo and enter the US. “I carried the prosthetic leg in a bag, because I was afraid it would get wet,” he says. But the current was too strong, and he had to let go of the leg to save himself, grasping for some bamboo branches to keep from being swept away. He managed to cross the river and crawl up onto the bank, but by then he was desperate: He turned himself in to the authorities, and was deported back to Honduras.
Back home, Santiago sought the support of an association that provides assistance to migrants. He was able to get a new prosthesis thanks to a program supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Eventually, Santiago was able to find a job as an assistant in a clinic run by the Honduran Ministry of Health, where now he earns 9,000 lempiras (about $360) a month – money that, he says, is not enough to support his wife and their eight-year-old son, Dylan. He managed to rebuild his life, but has yet to overcome the trauma of the injury. “At least I’m alive,” he says. “It’s a miracle.”
Placing all hopes on a prosthesis
Santiago found support from the New Life Foundation for Integral Rehabilitation (Fundación para la Rehabilitación Integral Vida Nueva), an organization founded in 2003 to help landmine amputees who had lost limbs during Nicaragua’s armed conflict in the 1980s – a bloody civil war that left tens of thousands dead and wounded. “Some people fled to Honduras and lost limbs trying to get there,” explains Reina Estrada, the Foundation’s executive director. When the land mines along the border between Nicaragua and Honduras were finally cleaned up, under the supervision of the Organization of American States (OAS), the foundation turned its efforts to another tragedy: the growing number of migrants returning home with amputated limbs, after attempting to reach the US.
For many, The Beast has been their best and often only option for reaching the US, but the routes and means of travel used by migrants have shifted in recent years. “We’ve identified a decrease in the use of the train, as a result of increasing insecurity,” says Lorena Guzmán, regional coordinator for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Guzmán says that migrants have been forced to seek out new routes, which can be even more dangerous, where they face assaults, kidnappings, and extorsion. The train remains an option, however, and every year it claims more victims.
In addition to the violence suffered by migrants at the hands of organized criminal groups, the Mexican government’s increasingly hostile immigration policies have meant more crack downs and more detentions, often accompanied by excessive use of force on the part of state authorities. In its efforts to curb migration to the US, the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has turned to military force. A report published in mid-May by the Foundation for Justice and the Democratic Rule of Law (FJEDD, for its acronym in Spanish) shows that in places like Tapachula, an entry point for undocumented migrants on the border between Mexico and Guatemala, the Mexican government has deployed 28,397 military personnel with the aim of controlling and repelling undocumented migration. Of these soldiers, 13,663 are members of the Army; 906 are from the Navy, and 13,828 are with the National Guard.
The day EL PAÍS visited the New Life Foundation’s headquarters in Choluteca, the sweltering, windowless building was buzzing with activity. Huge fans hummed constantly, in an attempt to dissipate the suffocating heat. Estrada works here with a small team that includes a Nicaraguan psychologist, a young man in charge of administration, and two other key figures: orthopedist Walter Aguilar and his assistant, Yenser Pineda, who together are in charge of fabricating prostheses. Aguilar and Pineda make the artificial limbs in their on-site workshop, where they have all the materials and equipment necessary to manufacture the devices that represent a chance at a new life for many Hondurans who have suffered an amputation.
Today, several patients are waiting for Aguilar to see them – that is, to analyze the condition of their stumps, to verify that the wounds have healed well, and to take their measurements and set a date for them to return to be fitted with their prosthesis. Or, as is often the case, to check the old and damaged prostheses of men who, compelled by misery, found work in construction or in the fields and have damaged their prosthetics on the job. “Remember, you can’t carry that much weight, you’ll put too much pressure on the prosthesis,” Aguilar chides one of the men, affectionately. “I have to work,” the man replies. “I have to eat.”
Among the Foundation’s visitors this morning is a strong and stocky, dark-skinned young man, with a radiant smile and an inquisitive expression. His name is Francis Espinoza Reyes, he’s 21 years old, and he was forced to migrate for the same reason that many young Honduran men are forced to migrate: because of the gangs that assault, extort and force the country’s youth to choose between joining las maras or fleeing for el norte. Francis left in 2019, when he was 18. He had managed to make his way through northern Central America and the better part of Mexico, but misfortune eventually struck in Monterrey, the large industrial capital of Mexico’s northeast state of Nuevo León. “We were on the train, and two of the people who were traveling next to me stole my stuff and threw me off the train,” he says. The Beast crushed part of his right foot when he fell. He remembers being taken away in an ambulance. When he woke up in a local hospital, he was given the terrifying diagnosis: the doctors recommended amputating his leg. “I told them they didn’t need to amputate it, that I had only broken the bottom part [of my foot], and I didn’t want them to cut it off,” he says. “When they did it, I didn’t want them to bring me back here [to Honduras], because I felt so bad for the people who would have to see me come back like this. That was the hardest thing to get over,” Francis says, dropping his gaze to the ground.
Francis was depressed for a long time. He felt like a burden, like he was worthless. Depression affects at least 64% of migrants detained in Mexico, according to a collaborative 2018 study conducted by five organizations. This is even more pronounced for migrants, like Francis, who survived traumatic attacks or accidents. Francis says it was only thanks to the support of his family that he was able to rebuild his life here in Honduras. He eventually found assistance through the ICRC program, and then his brother helped him buy a motorcycle cab, which he uses to make a living in Lempira, a department in the west of the country. “It’s been hard to get used to [the prosthesis], because it’s not the same as having two legs,” he says. “But it’s way worse to walk with crutches – I can’t live a normal life on crutches.”
A shelter for disabled migrants
Not all migrants who suffer an amputation en route to the United States want to go return home. Many stay in Mexico, often in one of the country’s migrant shelters, with the hope of eventually trying their luck at the border again. One such shelter is in the city of Celaya, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, and is run by Ignacio Martínez Ramírez, an unconventional evangelical pastor willing to help anyone who knocks on his door. In Martinez’s shelter, guests can take theater classes and listen to music whenever they want, and aren’t subjected to the dogmatic rules or conventions common in many of the country’s other religious shelters. This has earned Martinez the criticism of other pastors, who see him as a lost sheep, leading others astray. His shelter houses 31 migrants, 13 of them disabled. Most of them (80%, according to the pastor) are from Honduras – a percentage consistent with the figures for care provided by the ICRC program in the first quarter of 2022, when of the 83 total patients the clinic assisted, 56 were from Honduras.
It’s an early summer morning, and the shelter is bustling. The building has two stories, and a large open courtyard where a teacher is directing a group of migrants as they rehearse a play. They wear white masks, and each actor repeats his lines from memory. Other guests are lying on bunk beds, glued to their cell phones, while women who made the journey with their children tend to their youngest. At lunchtime, everyone sits and eats together at the tables, and then the real party starts: tropical music blares from the shelter’s loudspeakers. “Celaya is an obligatory stopover point for migrants, and I felt that the authorities were not adequately taking care of this forgotten population,” Martinez says. “We started by bringing food to where migrants would gather along the train tracks. Sometimes there would be as many as 200 people, and my wife and I felt sad because we didn’t have enough food for everyone and there wasn’t anything else we could do for them,” the pastor says.
So, he asked for support from some local groups, from his fellow church members, and from other residents, and in 2015, he opened the shelter, with the idea that migrants would have a place to sleep, shower and eat on their journey through Mexico. But this idea grew into something bigger, and today, for dozens of migrants who have seen their dreams shattered, the building is more of a home than a shelter. Here, migrants receive care, understanding, and the support of the ICRC program, which finances prostheses made in a workshop run by the Guanajuato Institute for People with Disabilities (INGUDIS, for its acronym in Spanish). They also receive rehabilitation therapy and other specialized care.
The shelter is home to 24-year-old Evert Rodríguez, a chubby, somewhat grumpy young man who doesn’t his frustration at the bad luck he’s been delt. “My wings were cut, I’m stuck,” he says, sitting in a wheelchair. His left leg was amputated and he hasn’t been able to get a prosthesis – his one hope for leaving the shelter and rebuilding his life. Like so many others, Rodríguez says he left Honduras to escape the gangs. “If you don’t want to be a violent person then you leave,” he explains. “I don’t want to go back to my country, I don’t want to have problems.” It was during his attempt to escape this violence that Rodríguez fell from The Beast. He had climbed on the train in Orizaba, in the state of Veracruz, around six in the evening. “We got on without a problem, but my backpack got stuck when we were climbing the ladder,” he recalls. “I tried to let it go but I fell, and the train ran over my leg. I’m a brave person, and I cinched the wound down with my shoelaces.” In a state of shock, Rodríguez had not yet realized the magnitude of what had just happened. He was rescued by some locals, who took him to a nearby hospital, but due to the severity of his condition, he was transferred to the Veracruz General Hospital.
At this point in his story, Rodríguez’s face twists into a grimace as he remembers the treatment he received at the hospital in Veracruz. “They did such a crap job,” he says. “Just imagine! They messed up the operation so bad that now my tendons are trashed. I’ve been like this for 14 months and they’re gonna have to do another operation. It’s all such garbage, such bullshit. Fuck, it’s been such a trauma, man. “If I at only had movement in this leg – because I don’t even have that – I’d already have gotten the prosthesic, but since they screwed it up so badly... It makes me want to...” He bites his lip and stops talking. Rodríguez can’t move the injured leg, which is why he needs another operation. This is his only option for getting a prosthesis, and with it, a new life. Sitting around him, his friends continue talking among themselves. Those who are expecting a prosthetic soon sit next to their crutches. Those who already have one are joking and playing games with each other. “What I want is to have my own one,” Evert says. “I like to work. I know a lot about agriculture, planting coffee, beans. That’s the work I’m good at: farming.” He looks down, rests his head on his palm, and moves his right leg around. The other leg stays motionless, unresponsive. He curses La Bestia. He curses his bad luck. “But I’m brave,” he says.",YES

385,tf_html," You’d be hard pressed to find a better conversationalist than actor Nick Ullett. These days you’ll find the veteran performer upstairs at the Matrix Theatre, where he’s regaling small groups of theatergoers with a lively account of local backstage madness. In “The Birthday Party: A Theatrical Catastrophe,” Ullett, a British-born actor who jokes that he’s so old he actually came to America by boat, spills the beans on the abandoned Geffen Playhouse revival of Harold Pinter’s “The Birthday Party.” The much-anticipated 2014 production was to be directed by Oscar-winning director William Friedkin, best known for his films “The French Connection” and “The Exorcist” — the latter of which may have inspired some of the malevolent antics Ullett entertainingly chronicles. This solo show, a Rogue Machine Theatre production directed by Lisa James, is one of those delightful instances of theater thinking outside the box. The hour-long piece is performed at the pocket-sized Henry Murray Stage, an attic-like space laid out like a cozy living room.Ullett is already in place, leaning on a bar stool, as theatergoers file in. The metaphoric fourth wall is nowhere in sight, as the actor casually banters with audience members. A good many fellow thespians are in attendance. The look of glee on their faces suggests they may have an insatiable appetite for the theatrical equivalent of inside baseball. Or maybe they just appreciate a juicy story well told. Droll in that articulate British way that never seems to break a sweat, Ullett is an expert raconteur — crisp yet colloquial. His manner is that of a genial dinner party host who has a doozy tale to unfold — one his guests might be more eager to savor than the meal itself.The cast of this ill-fated Pinter revival was exceptional and overwhelmingly British. Steven Berkoff, Tim Roth and Frances Barber (a London stage veteran whom Ullett compares to Judi Dench) were the big names. Ullett had originally auditioned for the meaty, menacing role of Goldberg, but this part went to Berkoff, a noted playwright as well as an actor with a long track record of playing bad guys. Directing, as this yarn suggests, is 90 percent type-casting. Ullett was thrilled when unexpectedly Friedkin offered him the role of Petey. The opportunity to take part in this stellar Los Angeles revival of a modern classic by one of the lions of the British theater seemed almost too good to be true. Sadly, that turned out to be the case. Fatefully, Ullett volunteered to serve as the Actors’ Equity deputy of the company. It’s a requirement of the union that one of its members be elected representative of the production to keep Equity informed of workplace conditions and disputes. It’s a job that Ullett has performed without incident in the past, but his sangfroid was tested by a battle of colossal egos that could give “Godzilla vs. King Kong” a run for its money. Friedkin, who receives a hefty share of the blame, had directed a 1968 film version of “The Birthday Party.” According to Ullett, he seemed to think he was directing another movie of the play. His nonchalant attitude toward the exigencies of the stage rankled the more experienced cast members, who resented the way he tried to control their every movement. Dictatorial about the visual scene, he seemed indifferent to other aspects of dramatic storytelling, as the rehearsal clock ticked ominously.Berkoff, a master of menace, apparently became savagely Pinteresque in the rehearsal room, browbeating members of the collaborative team, railing at what he took to be American cluelessness and rolling his eyes at the general obsequiousness toward Pinter, a fellow playwright he appeared not to hold in all that high regard. But it was Friedkin’s combination of Hollywood swagger and theatrical bumbling that really seemed to enrage Berkoff most. Eventually, Berkoff couldn’t stand it any longer and, in a fury hightailed it to LAX in a rental car that bore the dents of his anger, leaving the production without a Goldberg. Ullett quips that it was as if this revival of Pinter had been suddenly rewritten by Samuel Beckett. The new play, “Waiting for Goldberg,” was (in Godot-esque fashion) never going to arrive.Friedkin had demanded that another British actor of Berkoff’s stature be found. That there were scores of capable  actors within a five mile radius of the Geffen Playhouse (Ullett among them) hardly mattered. Practicality was not how Friedkin operated. As the search disastrously proceeded, he burned through money on the production as though Paramount Pictures were footing the bill.A life in the theater will break your heart. But first it will attempt to make you crazy. As “The Birthday Party” fell apart, Ullett was contending with other professional disappointments. His guest appearance on a popular sitcom ended on the cutting room floor. Adding salt to his wounds, his hope of getting cast as the understudy in the West End production of “Bakersfield Mist,” the play he starred in with his wife, Jenny O’Hara, in the world premiere production at the Fountain Theatre, came to naught.But no experience is wasted for an artist. And the “catastrophe” of this not-to-be Pinter revival has yielded anecdotal treasure. Names sometimes escape Ullett, and details of his story aren’t always properly set up. But he has a talent to dryly amuse. What’s more, his incisive candor elevates theatrical gossip into something more enriching.O’Hara warned her husband that if he tells this story onstage he’ll never work in this town again. Fortunately for us, he didn’t listen. In a talk-back at the end of the show, Ullett admitted that he quite liked Berkoff, ornery though he was, and that he respected Friedkin’s stature as one of the great film directors. Randall Arney, the Geffen Playhouse’s artistic director at the time, comes in for some criticism — confirming my original take on the situation. But there’s no score-settling malice here.

California's High-Speed Rail project is in full swing, with the state now shopping for trains and everything else needed to turn what's long been a bunch of impressive civil works into a functioning railroad. That's been possible thanks to a new infusion of much-needed funding and commitment from the federal government. ""We got $3.3 billion in new funds. It’s been wonderful, I don’t even know what other words to put to it,"" explained Boris Lipkin, Northern California Regional Director with the California High-Speed Rail Authority, during a Tuesday afternoon SPUR talk on the future of Bay Area rail. ""We’re in the process of buying trains, designing stations, tracks and systems. We've short-listed train-builders Alstom and Siemens, who will be eligible to bid.""

The plan is to have at least two trainsets purchased by the end of 2028, ready to start testing on over 100 miles of new tracks in the Central Valley at speeds up to 242 mph. The goal is to start revenue service by 2030.

That's just for the planned initial service in the Central Valley, with connections to ACE and Amtrak to get to the Bay Area. Work continues in earnest to get the ""bookends"" of the system, which will ultimately run from Los Angeles to San Francisco, ready to go. The Bay Area end will come first.

""It all has to tie together: the Salesforce Transit Center, Caltrain electrification, the portal, and Diridon Station—all of these are connected pieces,"" said Lipkin. ""How do we get people from one place to another? We’re very much engaged with everybody to make sure that all works.""

The Authority is doing preliminary work to build the connection via the Pacheco Pass to the next major stop on the system, Diridon in San Jose via Gilroy. ""The bookends are really important, it’s where you get the most riders,"" explained Eric Eidlin, Station Planning Manager with the City of San Jose Department of Transportation, and another of the panelists. He was there to talk about the ongoing planning to make sure Diridon is reconstructed to provide the most seamless possible transfers between Caltrain, Amtrak, light rail, and the coming BART and CA High-Speed Rail services. ""I've interviewed people in France and Germany. We have the right geography population sizes, it all makes a lot of sense.""

Meanwhile, Dahlia Chazan, Caltrain Deputy Chief of Planning, talked about how electrification is still 'on track' to begin in the fall, with electric train sets already testing up and down the corridor. Electrification will allow faster acceleration and more frequent service. ""We're really excited about being able to add weekend service, so we will go from once hourly to twice hourly on the weekends,"" said Chazan. She described the Caltrain electrification project as the first tangible step towards a statewide high-speed rail system for the riding public. ""It’s not quite as fast, but it’s got a number of the benefits."" And the Caltrain corridor will be shared with high-speed rail when the Central Valley is connected.

But then there's that other challenge—getting the last couple of miles from the current Caltrain 4th and King terminus into downtown San Francisco. When that tunnel is done, now called ""the portal,"" it will finally allow trains to enter the ""train box,"" a two-floor station built in the basement of the existing Salesforce transit center. All the bus lines that currently serve the transit center ""will be joined by two rail operators [Caltrain and HSR] with BART a couple of blocks away,"" said Anna Harvey, Deputy Project Director for the Transbay Joint Powers Authority. ""That will really achieve a seamless transfer, with the addition of HSR adding the entire state to all that regional transit.""

Completing all these goals collaboratively and in a logical order is challenging, with ongoing funding streams still dependent on the vagaries of elections. Lipkin said he hopes a new dedication of state funds, such as by extending cap-and-trade, plus a regional measure will help keep all these projects moving forward to help realize the vision of a better-connected state and Bay Area. Eidlin said he hopes Southern California will do more to develop its station areas, such as in Palmdale, where the Brightline West train project to Vegas and California High-Speed Rail, would someday, hopefully, merge into a larger interstate high-speed rail system.

While questions and big challenges remain, the panelists said they are continuing to work together to figure out how to get new services available in the fastest time frame. The first big one, of course, will be this fall with the launch of electrified Caltrain. Their hope is new components of this statewide vision for an integrated rail and station-development plan will come online every few years after that.

747,np_url,"A mural celebrating the 100th anniversary of Delano lies on Main Street. The city’s population is a little more than 52,000 people, about 76% Latino and nearly 40% foreign born.

Celestino Hilario Garcia, his eyes bloodshot and his voice raw, struggled to explain that his brother’s and sister-in-law’s deaths were not his fault.

A month ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had trained their sights on Santos Hilario Garcia. In the early morning darkness, they followed in two black Jeeps as he and his wife, Marcelina Garcia Profecto, dropped their teenage daughter off at Robert F. Kennedy High School.

Minutes later, the couple were dead, having crashed their truck as they tried to escape the agents. ICE officials later said that the couple had not been their target — Garcia happened to have matched the description of the person they were after.

That person was Celestino, a Mexican immigrant who, like his brother, was in the country illegally.

“It was his car, it was in his name. If I lent him my car, then it’s my fault,” Celestino said. “It was his car. His car…. They had time to check the plates.”

Blame has been a recurrent theme since the fatal crash in this Central Valley town of vast farmlands.

There have been protests, with some Delano officials and residents blaming ICE and the Trump administration for being too aggressive in their crusade against illegal immigration. ICE has blamed the deaths on California’s “sanctuary” policies, which the agency says put it in a position to target, and sometimes arrest, immigrants without legal status who were not initially sought for removal.

Aggressive immigration enforcement by the Trump administration has become an issue across the nation. Last month, top federal officials and the president condemned Oakland’s mayor, Libby Schaaf, after she warned the community of upcoming ICE sweeps.

The Delano case took on a new dimension when the local police department asked prosecutors to look into whether two ICE agents had given false information to police after the crash. On Wednesday, Kern County prosecutors said they would not file charges.

“There is no credible evidence that either agent lied,” Kern County Dist. Atty. Lisa Green said. “I approached this case, and every other case, by trying to do the right thing, for the right reason. Politics had nothing to do with it.”

The decision is unlikely to settle matters, particularly since ICE will not say why deportation officers were after Celestino. And it still is unclear why the couple initially stopped for the agents before speeding off.

“Santos Hilario and Marcelina did not get justice today from the Kern County district attorney, and they deserved it,” said Diana Tellefson Torres, the executive director of the United Farm Workers Foundation. “They and their six orphaned children are just the latest casualties of the federal government’s recent targeting of hardworking immigrant farmworkers who feed all of us.”

Delano, with a population of about 52,000, is a town of farmworkers.

About 76% of the city’s residents are Latino, and nearly 40% are foreign born — many of them now deep in the labor of filling buckets with plucked blueberries and tying grapevines to metal wires to help them grow properly.

The town’s median household income is $36,265.

Interim Police Chief Raul Alvizo’s parents labored in the fields, as did he as a teenager. Mayor Grace Vallejo was a migrant farmworker, bouncing from town to town across the state with her parents and siblings.

About 30 miles north of Bakersfield in Kern County, Delano is a center for growing table grapes. The sign welcoming people to the city features a cluster of grapes. A mural along Main Street, celebrating the city’s 100th anniversary, shows farmworkers working under bunches of the fruit.

The city’s vineyards were the scene of a September 1965 grape strike, led by Filipino workers who were soon joined by civil rights icon Cesar Chavez to fight back against unfair treatment. The movement led to the formation of the United Farm Workers of America.

On a recent afternoon, under a clear sky, six women with bandannas covering their faces fanned out among rows of grapevines.

“We leave our homes not knowing if we’re going to come back,” said one, who is originally from the Mexican state of Sinaloa.

“Imagine the necessity to work but with the fear that when we leave, that immigration is going to stop and take us,” another said. “And our children? What is going to happen to them?”

The workers refused to give their names, fearing being targeted for arrest and deportation.

After the crash that killed Garcia and Profecto, many immigrants were afraid to leave their homes. Business owners and residents in Delano, many of whom could see their own story in Garcia’s and Profecto’s, set about raising money for the couple’s children.

At Tony’s Barbershop, Osbaldo Prieto, whose mother is a farmworker, gave the couple’s two sons free haircuts in preparation for the memorial service this month. The mayor’s niece donated haircuts to the four daughters.

Emmanuel Perez, who left for the U.S. from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, in 1978, was a farmworker for more than a decade.

The week of the crash, Perez, who owns a furniture store on Main Street, donated beds, a dining set and sofas to the family.

“We felt bad, because that’s how we came,” Perez said, taking a shaky breath as tears filled his eyes. “We came here to progress…. These people came probably the same way. Now their kids are going to be the ones suffering without their parents.”

After leaving Mexico, Garcia and his wife landed first in Arizona and later in Delano. Celestino and his wife came also, raising four children in the city.

“In Mexico, there is work, but there aren’t opportunities to progress or have a better future for your kids, better education — that’s what I wanted for my kids. That’s what my brother-in-law wanted,” said Celestino’s wife, who asked that she not be named. “He wanted his kids to get ahead and have a better education than what they could get in Mexico.”

Garcia and Profecto had built a life in a drab apartment complex alongside dozens of other farmworkers’ families.

In the predawn hours of March 13, ICE agents were outside, watching for Celestino, who said he had not lived there since 2014.

Citing an ongoing review, ICE declined to say why Celestino was wanted for removal. He said he did not know why the agents were after him.

Garcia and Profecto had just dropped their daughter off and turned their blue pickup onto a busy road when emergency lights flashed behind them. They stopped, but as the deportation officer got out of his Jeep, the pickup took off.

Ramiro Sanchez, an ICE deportation officer, said he followed in the same direction but was not in “pursuit with emergency lights/sirens,” according to a Delano police report. Dimas Benitez, an ICE agent in a second vehicle, also stated the two were not in “pursuit.”

Surveillance video, shot at the midway point from the initial stop and the collision, showed the immigration agents’ vehicles traveling in the same direction as the couple’s truck with their emergency lights activated.

ICE said it is reviewing the incident but noted that three separate witnesses who spoke with Delano police about the crash said they did not see anyone pursuing the couple. They previously cited sanctuary policies that “have pushed ICE out of jails” and “force our officers to conduct more enforcement in the community — which poses increased risks for law enforcement and the public.”

“It also increases the likelihood that ICE will encounter other illegal aliens who previously weren’t on our radar,” spokesman Richard Rocha said in a statement.

“The unfortunate outcome of the decision made by the vehicle driver to erratically evade ICE officers is why ICE encourages all of those we encounter to comply with officers’ commands in order to ensure our ability to carry out our mission as safely as possible,” the agency said in a statement.

Although Garcia had been convicted in 2014 of driving under the influence and was voluntarily returned to Mexico three times from 2008 to 2017, he was not an arrest target. Profecto had no prior encounters with ICE and no criminal record.

Celestino was informed about their deaths by one of their daughters. He burst into tears before going to the spot where his brother’s car had overturned. At the scene, Delano police showed him his brother’s Mexican consular identification card — which is what they used to identify him.

“We’re not animals, we’re people,” Celestino said. “They want to clean their hands of this, but it’s not going to be that easy.”

At his brother’s funeral service, next to the church hall where Cesar Chavez’s union voted to join the Delano grape strike decades ago, Celestino sobbed. As two pewter gray caskets were taken out to waiting hearses, he draped his body over one of them.
