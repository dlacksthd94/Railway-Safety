SHAFTER, CA — January 17, 2026 — A 40-year-old man was killed Saturday morning after being struck by a train in Shafter, according to authorities. The Kern County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as Gerardo Becerra Perez, a resident of Shafter. Law enforcement officials said Perez was hit by a train near the intersection of South Beech Avenue and East Los Angeles Avenue. Officers responded to the scene at approximately 9:34 a.m., where Perez was pronounced dead. The circumstances leading up to the collision were not immediately released, and the incident remains under investigation.



 Each year, hundreds of lives are lost in train-related incidents across the United States, many occurring at crossings with limited warning signs, faulty signals, or inadequate fencing. According to the National Safety Council, railroad fatalities reached 954 in 2024, reflecting a 1% decrease from the revised 2023 total of 967. Candice Bond, a seasoned train accident attorney, emphasized the importance of conducting an independent investigation promptly following a fatal crash to help preserve critical evidence for a victim’s family. “An experienced attorney can help shield grieving families from large railroad companies, which often deploy their own investigative teams and have extensive resources to defend against claims,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal. “Acting quickly is crucial in these cases to ensure that all evidence is properly examined,” Bond added. 

 Pending the outcome of the investigation, surviving family members of Gerardo Becerra Perez may have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim. In such cases, families may seek compensation for loss of companionship, emotional distress, and the pain and suffering caused by the sudden loss of a loved one. “The emotional toll following the unexpected death of a family member can be devastating,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “A wrongful death attorney can closely monitor the investigation while working to protect the legal rights and interests of the victim’s family,” Formica said.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,17,2026,9:34,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Kern,CA,Unknown,Shafter,Unknown,Unknown,K,K,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Day,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,40,1,Male,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,0,Unknown,Unknown,0,0,Unknown,1,The incident remains under investigation.,0,0,No,No,Unknown,"Gerardo Becerra Perez, 40, was killed on Saturday morning, January 17, 2026, in Shafter, CA, after being struck by a train near the intersection of South Beech Avenue and East Los Angeles Avenue.

Deadly Crash Shuts Down Folsom Light Rail

A deadly crash shuts down Folsom light rail near Iron Point Station on Thursday afternoon, January 22, 2026, disrupting Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT) service. A vehicle struck the station ramp and overturned onto the tracks, blocking service between the Sunrise and Historic Folsom stations.

Folsom police confirmed that a pedestrian was killed, and another individual was transported to a hospital for treatment. SacRT crews inspected the tracks for damage before resuming normal service around 8 p.m., with a bus bridge in place to maintain transit along the affected route.

Footage from the scene showed the sedan resting at an angle across the tracks, with damage to the station parking lot, indicating a violent collision through the area prior to impacting the tracks.

Safety Tips Near Transit Stations

Incidents like this highlight the importance of safety around light rail stations and transit areas:

Observe speed limits and stop signs in parking lots and near station ramps.

Be vigilant for pedestrians in high-traffic transit zones.

Avoid distractions while driving, especially near busy stations with foot traffic.

Yield to emergency responders and follow detours when incidents occur.

Being alert in transit areas can prevent severe collisions and save lives.

Over the weekend, her father James Weems said he received a call telling him his daughter had been struck by a driver at the Iron Point Light Rail Station. He visited the crash site Sunday night and struggled to understand how the car struck his daughter before ending up on the tracks, he said.

""I hope she didn't see it coming. Because, I try to think about that. That's what I was trying to see last night. But I couldn't see it,"" Weems said.

""I've tried to make some sort of sense of it and all that kind of stuff, but it's kind of hard,"" Weems said through tears.

Steffy was reportedly on her way to work as a dance instructor at the Hawkins School of Performing Arts in Folsom. Dance was part of her life from an early age, her father said.

Steffy was well known in the local dance community, including at The Torch Club, where her friends said she was a regular on Sundays and recognized for her dance moves.

Abigail Gibson, Steffy's friend, said she brought energy wherever she went and was passionate about dance, the people she taught and the community she built.

""She was just the life of the party everywhere she went,"" Gibson said. ""It was kind of impossible to be in a bad mood around her. She was always moving, always singing, always dancing.""

""Everything is still all in the works. This is all very sudden, but right now we're trying to contribute all community funds to further her legacy, especially in the arts, specifically with dance and children, kind of furthering the love that she loved to give to everyone,"" Weber said.

Weems said his hope is that his daughter left a lasting impression on the children she taught and that their futures reflect the impact she had on them.

Authorities said the incident occurred near Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive at approximately 10:49 a.m. Scott was pronounced dead at the scene. The Ontario Police Department is investigating the crash.

ONTARIO, CA, January 25, 2026 — A man was fatally struck by a train Sunday morning in Ontario, according to a press release from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

FATAL PEDESTRIAN TRAIN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Train-pedestrian accidents can occur for a variety of reasons, including operator error, track defects, mechanical failures, signal system issues, or reckless conduct. As part of the investigation, authorities will also assess whether the area was properly secured and safe for pedestrian crossing.

The National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) reports that roughly 1,000 fatalities occur each year in train-related incidents across the United States. In cases like this, Candice Bond, an experienced train accident attorney, emphasized the importance of initiating an independent investigation as early as possible to help preserve critical evidence for a victim’s family.

“An experienced attorney can help shield grieving families from large rail companies, which often dispatch their own investigators to accident scenes and have significant resources to defend against liability claims,” said Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal and national analyst for Accident Injury News.

WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

Depending on the outcome of the investigation, the family of Jamaal Scott may be eligible to pursue a wrongful death claim. Such claims may allow surviving relatives to seek compensation for loss of companionship, emotional distress, pain, and suffering resulting from a fatal accident.

“The emotional burden following the sudden loss of a loved one can be immense,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “Families facing these tragedies deserve to have their rights protected. A wrongful death attorney can monitor the official investigation and work to ensure that a family’s legal interests are fully safeguarded during this difficult time.”",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,25,2026,10:49,AM,Unknown,Unknown,San Bernardino,CA,Unknown,Ontario,Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive,Unknown,K,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Day,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,43,1,Male,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,0,Unknown,0,0,0,Unknown,1,Yes,0,0,No,No,Unknown,"On Sunday morning, January 25, 2026, at approximately 10:49 a.m., 43-year-old Jamaal Lionel Scott was fatally struck by a train near Archibald Avenue and Airport Drive in Ontario, CA.

A California congressman is calling for more railroad oversight. It comes on the three-year anniversary of one of the nation's most destructive railway accidents and just a day after a derailment in Stockton.
Most of the 17,000 Pacific Gas and Electric customers now have power restored following Monday's train accident in the Stockton railyards. But that mishap highlights the impact a train derailment can have on nearby communities.
""Millions of Americans live and work along hazmat railways,"" said Ed Kelly, general president of the International Association of Firefighters. ""We need to protect them.""
This week marks the three-year anniversary of the fire and explosion in East Palestine, Ohio, that was caused by a train derailment.
Congressman John Garamendi says similar tanker cars carrying flammable chemicals regularly come through Davis, Sacramento, and other Northern California communities.
""And we've had our share of almost-serious accidents,"" Garamendi said.
He is co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would require new railroad safety standards.
""This rail safety bill covers sensible things,"" Garamendi said. ""It's not complex, but it is very, very important.""
It would mandate having at least two crew members on board trains. It also requires railroads to install defect detectors that can spot mechanical problems, and it would force railroads to fund more hazmat training for first responders.
""Too often, firefighters arrive at train derailments with limited information and limited training,"" Kelly said.
Penalties for safety violations would also be increased.
The Association of American Railroads says there's no proven safety benefit to justify the cost of requiring two crew members. They oppose these kinds of regulations and want to adopt modern technologies to enhance safety benefits.
But bill supporters say more work needs to be done to protect communities from any more railway disasters.

Google Streetview photo.

BY STEPHANIE LAMDaily Post Correspondent
Palo Alto community members are urging City Council to close the intersection where Churchill Avenue intersects with the railroad tracks after a Caltrain hit and killed 17-year-old Summer Devi Mehta last Tuesday.
In a letter to the City Council Nick Mehta, Summer’s father, said he supports closing the intersection, believing Churchill provided an “easy means for her to impulsively act at a low moment.”
The letter was read by a friend of Nick Mehta’s during tonight’s council meeting. 
The Caltrain crossing at Churchill Avenue and Alma Street is adjacent to Palo Alto High School, and has been the site of multiple student suicides over the past few years. 
“It is too late for my daughter but it is not too late for others,” Nick Mehta wrote. 
In response, Mayor Vicki Veenker said tonight that an The Rail Safety/Youth Mental Health ad hoc committee has been created to look into ramping up safety measures at the intersection, and the logistics of shutting it down, an action that Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin urged the council to do in a Thursday letter.
The committee consists of council members Julie Lythcott-Haims, Pat Burt and Greer Stone.
Lythcott-Haims said the committee has already met with Caltrain and other city transportation safety officials to explore their options, which included talks about installing more high-tech cameras that can detect unusual movements on the tracks and paying security guards to monitor the intersection. The committee will meet again this week, Lythcott-Haims said. 
But several residents said they also want council to shut the Churchill crossing immediately, and not wait for the committee’s insights and recommendation.
A resident who identified herself as Bre. T said her daughter was Summer’s friend and is “begging” the council to close the intersection.
“Failing to close is a complacency I just can’t tolerate as a mom anymore,” she said.
Prior to the ad hoc meeting, Caltrain and Palo Alto were working on installing new technologies at Churchill crossings to improve safety, including using AI to help detect and alert officials about lingering cars and pedestrians on the tracks. Other potential updates include a partial underpass to reduce car and pedestrian traffic and grade separation, which would require temporarily closing the crossing.",Caltrain,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Caltrain,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,CA,06,Palo Alto,Churchill Avenue,Public,K,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Caltrain,Unknown,Unknown,1,Train struck pedestrian,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Caltrain,1,Main,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,17,2,Female,2,No,8,Suicide/Attempted suicide,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Yes,Yes,"The Rail Safety/Youth Mental Health ad hoc committee has been created to look into ramping up safety measures at the Churchill Avenue/Alma Street intersection, and the logistics of shutting it down.

The updates span MARTA track protection procedures, an HSI Port of Stockton rerailing accident, and conductor injuries connected to switching or shoving movements.

NTSB rail accident reports: key findings and updates

One report centers on an Oct. 19, 2024, incident in Atlanta involving Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). The NTSB concluded that MARTA track protection procedures were insufficient for the location and type of work being performed.

Don’t miss…1000th U-trough milestone for Victoria’s rail bridges

A technician working on wayside train approach lights was struck by a MARTA train. Investigators said the procedures did not provide adequate warning time for technicians to move to safety before the train arrived, consistent with the NTSB Railroad Investigation Report (RIR2602). The NTSB also cited a contributing factor: the designated lookout was performing tasks not consistent with his duties, which meant the oncoming train was not detected in time.

HSI Port of Stockton rerailing accident

The NTSB also issued findings on a March 11, 2025, accident involving Hulcher Services Inc. (HSI) at the Port of Stockton in California. The board determined the probable cause was the lack of a standardized process for how and where a crew member should be safely positioned when operating a hand brake during a rerailing operation.

According to the NTSB, an HSI assistant division manager trainee was seriously hurt while working as part of an eight-person crew rerailing four rail cars that had derailed. After the accident, HSI added a new rule to its safe practices handbook and incorporated it into its standard operating procedures.

Public dockets for Union Pacific and R. J. Corman cases

In addition to investigation reports, the NTSB opened the public docket for its ongoing investigation of a June 25, 2025, accident in Lexington, Nebraska, involving a Union Pacific Railroad conductor. The conductor was seriously injured while riding the lead tank car during a shoving movement.

The NTSB also opened a public docket for its ongoing investigation of a June 26, 2025, accident at Guthrie Yard in Guthrie, Kentucky. The case involves an R. J. Corman Railway Group conductor who was seriously injured during a rail-car switching operation. Although the docket has been opened, it has not been released as of today.

BNSF grade crossing welding truck accident near New Rockford

Another NTSB investigation report addressed a Nov. 4, 2024, accident near New Rockford, North Dakota, involving BNSF Railway employees. A BNSF Railway maintenance-of-way employee was fatally struck by a BNSF freight train while driving a welding truck across a highway–railroad grade crossing, and another maintenance-of-way employee in the passenger seat was injured.

The NTSB determined the probable cause was the welding team’s failure to detect the approaching BNSF freight train as they backed the welding truck over the private grade crossing.

A contributing factor was the team’s noncompliance with, and lack of understanding of, BNSF’s safety rule S-12.8; Railway Supply also summarizes the NTSB’s conclusions in its coverage of the case, NTSB final report BNSF collision: N.D. crash findings. After the accident, BNSF clarified the backing rule.

GLENDALE, CA, (February 04, 2026) - The Glendale Police Department said a 35-year-old woman was killed in a crash with a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train along Brazil Street on Wednesday morning.

Zukhra Kurbanova, 35, was killed Wednesday morning when her vehicle was struck by a downtown Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train at a crossing in Glendale.


She was identified by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner as Zukhra Kurbanova.
The crash occurred just west of the intersection of San Fernando Road and Broadway.
Kurbanova was driving a vehicle northbound on West San Fernando when she attempted to make a right turn onto Broadway around 9 a.m. and was struck by a Metrolink train traveling on the tracks. Tragically, she died at the scene from her injuries. The train was carrying roughly 150 passengers, three of whom were injured. One person was transported to a hospital. A bystander struck by debris from the crash was also hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.
Two trains, each on the Antelope Valley and San Bernardino lines, were canceled after the collision.
This is an ongoing investigation.CRASH INVESTIGATION NEEDED
Train accidents such as this can occur for several reasons, including train personnel error, train track failure, a mechanical error or malfunction, a signalman error, and reckless actions.
Each year, train-related crashes claim hundreds of lives across the United States. Many of these fatalities result from poorly marked crossings, malfunctioning signals and inadequate fencing. Railroad deaths totaled 954 in 2024, a 1% decrease from the 2023 revised total of 967, the National Safety Council said in a report. During the probe, investigators will also examine if the crash site was made safe for the crossing.
