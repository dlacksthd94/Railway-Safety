He was the second person killed by an Amtrak train this month.
Authorities are investigating the death of a man who was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in northwest Berkeley on Tuesday morning.
He was the second person to be killed in an Amtrak train fatality in Berkeley this month. The first incident took place Oct. 4 near the railway crossing with Harrison Street, according to media reports.
On Tuesday, Amtrak said an individual who was trespassing on the track ""came into contact with the train"" around 9:15 a.m. near Gilman Street.
As of publication time, he had been identified only as a man in his 40s. His name has not yet been released.
The train was traveling from Auburn, California, to San Jose, Amtrak said.
""Amtrak is working with local law enforcement to investigate the incident. Train 529 resumed its journey shortly before noon,"" Amtrak said in a statement at 12:40 p.m.
There were no reported injuries to the 77 passengers or crew on board.
Trespassing on railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, followed by railroad-highway grade crossing incidents, Amtrak said.
""These incidents can affect everyone involved,"" Amtrak said, ""those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers. They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and grade crossings.""
Amtrak works with Operation Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI) to reduce train fatalities ""by emphasizing the obvious dangers of being on railroad property or disregarding warnings at rail crossings.""
It was the second train fatality of the month in Berkeley
The fatality earlier this month took place Oct. 4 when Amtrak train 545 was en route to Oakland from Sacramento at 5:35 p.m.
The Alameda County coroner's office identified the victim from that incident as 56-year-old Selana Williams.
In a story over the weekend, the Daily Californian said Williams, who was known as ""Sissy,"" had been unhoused since 2018 and was a beloved member of the People's Park community.

SUNOL, Calif. - Passengers aboard an Altamont Corridor Express train traveling westbound near Sunol on Tuesday had to be evacuated after a 100-foot mudslide blocked the tracks.
Alameda County Fire Department Division Chief Randall West told KTVU that the train, carrying 230 passengers and crew, did not derail at 8:45 a.m., and there were no injuries or equipment damaged by the mudslide.
Essentially, the train was stopped on its track because of the mud.
A passenger took video from inside the train, showing tree branches that had fallen outside cracked train windows.
Union Pacific crews were sent to inspect the tracks and work to get them cleared.
""It was more like a shock. But it was very short. So we just moved for a second and then stop,"" said passenger Fatima Racilli.
The train started off in Stockton at 6:50 a.m. and had been bound for San Jose.
At around noon, a second train was sent to retrieve the passengers by coupling the two trains together and pulling the stalled one to the Pleasanton station.
""At that point, ACE 05 became unable to progress on its route. At which time Union Pacific was notified and dispatched a crew to clean up the tracks,"" said David Lipari, a spokesman for the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission.
Experts said weeks of heavy rain was likely a contributing factor for the accident.
""When the trains go by, they cause vibrations in the ground. And that combination of water-loosened soil can in some circumstances, lead t to a mudslide,"" said Dr. Frannie Edwards of the Mineta Transportation Institute.
Photos courtesy Alameda County Fire Department.
Officials said there was minimal train damage, and no injuries to passengers and crew due to built-in safety features.
""The train itself performed as it was designed. The Lexan windows were hit by a lot of shrubbery and vegetation, but they did not shatter,"" said Edwards.
Once the transfer of passengers was completed, the second train reversed course – backing along the tracks back to the Pleasanton Station.
Passengers were off loaded, and moved to buses to complete the trip to San Jose.
""This is a better situation than driving to work in Silicon Valley every day. I’ll continue to ride the train,"" said one passenger, who missed a day at work due to the delay.
The train is expected to be restored Wednesday morning.
The mudslide also disrupted travel for passengers headed from San Jose to the Central Valley, as their northbound service was stuck behind mud and metal.
ACE Transit officials said the three Capitol Corridor trains headed from San Jose to the East Bay Tuesday night would honor ACE Transit tickets.

OAKLAND, Calif. (KGO) -- An Amtrak train hit a truck in Oakland just before 9 a.m. Thursday, dragging it about 30 yards and immediately sparking a huge fire.
The driver of the truck and his passenger, a co-worker, were able to jump out of the truck before the impact. The driver, 73-year-old Javier Soria, said their truck was stuck on the track.
""All of a sudden, I saw that I got stuck and then I saw the (train) light and said 'Oh, my God.' I tried to go back and forward and he said, 'You have to get out of the truck, that train is going to hit you!' So I ran across the street and tried to stop the Amtrak - but no he wouldn't stop, he just kept going,"" Soria said, showing how he waved his arms in the hopes that the train operator would see him.
The crash happened at the intersection of Fruitvale Ave and E 10th in Oakland.
Soria and his co-worker were hauling garbage and were headed to the dump when he says the truck wheels got stuck on the track. He said he felt some panic but was calm enough to jump out of the truck in time.

""The impact was terrible. I was worried about the Amtrak operator, he was in front, he is the one who hit it,"" Soria said.
An Amtrak spokesperson says the Amtrak Coast Starlight train 11 had 111 passengers and crew members on board. No one was hurt.
""All of a sudden it started slowing down, kind of a halt but not too abrupt,"" explained passenger Sonya Kotler. ""Everyone was safe. It wasn't too scary. And then they told us we hit some thing and we had to get off.""
While Sonya got off the train, most passengers remained on the train which continued on after the engines were swapped out.
The train was headed to Los Angeles from Seattle.

Train Hits Car In Union City Saturday
Two people were in the car, which was pushed 800 feet up the track.
UNION CITY, CA — Two people in a small four-door car escaped injury Saturday night when the car's driver unwittingly turned onto railroad tracks in the path of an Amtrak train, the Alameda County Fire Department said.
The accident happened about 6 p.m. Saturday when the car, near the railroad crossing at Railroad and E Streets, turned onto the Union Pacific tracks into the path of an Amtrak Capital Corridor train.
Fire Department spokesman Brian Centoni said the train hit the car from behind, and pushed the vehicle about 800 feet up the track before both came to a stop.

A freight train was rushing past on one of the tracks, and the trio was waiting for it to pass before crossing at Hearst Avenue near Fourth Street in West Berkeley. They were eating some pastries from Peet’s Coffee.
All of a sudden, Bell looked up and noticed another train hurtling toward him and his friends. He didn’t have time to think. He jumped back and ran off the tracks, bringing his bicycle with him.
Within seconds, Bell turned around. His two friends were gone, run over by the Amtrak train.
“I looked up and saw the lights on the other train,” Bell said Friday, becoming visibly distraught at times while talking to a reporter. “I said, ‘Shit, train,’ and I took off running. When I looked around they were gone.”
The Alameda County coroner’s office on Monday released the name of the two men: Jason Clary, 37, with no fixed address and Jupiter Marley, 31, with no fixed address.
The men were killed Thursday night when they were struck by Train 717 on its way from Bakersfield to Oakland, according to Christina Leeds, a spokeswoman for Amtrak. (Amtrak had identified the train number as 550, which goes from San Jose to Auburn, on its Twitter page Thursday night. Berkeleyside will seek clarification from Amtrak.)
Jupiter Marley, also known as “Jupiter of the Universe,” was 31, according to public records. Fixie was around 37, said Bell, who is 41. Both of the men who were killed had housed family in Berkeley, he said. They also both had girlfriends who lived on the street. Jupiter had a young daughter around 2.5 years old, said Bell.
After the train hit his friends, Bell was stunned. He wasn’t sure what to do so he returned to an area near Hearst and Second Street known as “the alley.” He had to break the news to his friends’ girlfriends.
“I couldn’t believe what had just happened,” said Bell. “It didn’t seem real to me.”
Some homeless advocates are wondering if recent actions by Caltrans might have upset the men’s equilibrium and in some way contributed to their deaths. Caltrans had just dismantled two nearby homeless encampments along University Avenue where the men were living, one Wednesday and one Thursday. The temperature reached into the high 80s on Thursday, leading Barbara Brust, a homeless advocate, to wonder if the two men killed had been dehydrated, tired and stressed, which led them to make bad judgments.
“Where do we go? Answer us!” #berkmtg #WhereDoWeGo
Berkeley homeless persecution by CalTrans, BPD.— JP Massar (@jpmassar) September 13, 2019
Posting on Twitter, JP Massar shared a photograph of Andrea Henson on Thursday as she sat outside Berkeley city offices with signs about the men who died as part of the recently launched “Where do we go?” campaign supporting those experiencing homelessness. The sign included a reference to the hot weather.
But Bell said Jupiter and Fixie seemed good to him in the minutes before their deaths. Jupiter was drinking coffee and had those pastries; Fixie was riding his bike. Neither man was intoxicated, said Bell.
The two men had been living on the streets for at least three or so years, said Bell, who came from Las Vegas a few years ago after he had been shot five times by someone he didn’t know. Both of the men who were killed had been admired, he said.
“Fixie was amazing with bikes; he could fix anything,” said a woman who called herself J. That’s why he had the nickname “Fixie.”
“Jupiter was funny as hell, always goofing around, always smiling,” said J.
Bell said Fixie was “a true Irish dude,” a kind-hearted person who was a whiz on bikes. He was extremely generous, too. But like many living on the streets, something had happened to interrupt his life and hand him hard times, he said.
Jupiter was “the greatest,” said Bell. “He had so much love.”
Bell said the three men had climbed under the train crossing guards, which were down, although the alarms were no longer ringing. The freight train that was rushing by came every night at the same time and took 6-10 minutes to barrel through Berkeley. There isn’t usually another train there at the same time, said Bell.
They didn’t hear the train that struck Jupiter and Fixie, possibly because they were so used to the noise.
“It’s like white noise to us,” he said. “You hear the train all the time so your sensories don’t go off.”
Bell keeps replaying the scene in his head, over and over.
“I was the furthest away from the train,” he said. “I wonder, did they just freeze? Did they run into each other trying to run away? I don’t know. I wish it could all start over again and all of them could move with me.”
Update: Friends of Jason Clary mourned his death on Facebook. Clary was a former employee of the State Bicycle Co. and was a champion bicyclist.
The company put together a video five years ago of Clary riding through San Francisco. A friend made a tribute video of Clary riding his bike.
Marley’s friends are also posting about him on Facebook.
Here is a video that Marley posted to his Facebook page a number of months ago.

The occupants quickly exited the vehicle and stood off to the side waiting for assistance. Shortly after, an Amtrak train collided into the disabled vehicle. While the speed of the train was slow, the damage to the vehicle was significant.
Both Amtrak Police and Union Pacific Police officers responded to the scene to investigate. The initial investigation noted that poor visibility due to the weather conditions were likely to blame and that drugs or alcohol were not a factor.

SAN LORENZO (CBS SF) -- A junior at KIPP King Collegiate High School was fatally struck by a Union Pacific train in the San Lorenzo area of unincorporated Alameda County Wednesday morning, authorities said.
The pedestrian strike was reported at 8:06 a.m. in the vicinity of Grant and Railroad avenues, according to Aisha Knowles, a spokeswoman for the Alameda County Fire Department. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Alameda County sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly.
The school is located nearby at 2005 Via Barrett. A tearful KIPP King Collegiate Principal Kelly Lara confirmed it was a student to reporters on the scene. ""He will be incredibly missed. We are all incredibly heartbroken.""
He was in the 11th grade, according to school officials. The Alameda County coroner's bureau was not yet releasing the victim's name.
A Union Pacific official told KPIX 5 the teen was either walking or riding a bicycle along the tracks and was struck on a bridge over San Lorenzo creek where pedestrians are not allowed.
""Parents, talk to your kids. Let's not have your kids traverse along the railroad tracks,"" said Kelly. ""There's so many reasons why. One, is the trains.""
The train's engineer and conductor have been ""put in touch"" with peer counselors, according to Union Pacific spokesman Justin Jacobs.

(KGO) -- A mother and her toddler were killed when an Amtrak train slammed into their SUV in the East Bay.
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon on Washington Avenue and Halcyon Drive in San Leandro at around 1:30 p.m.
The Alameda County coroner identified the mother and daughter as 30-year-old Vannessa Henriquez and 3-year-old Saidy.
A Toyota SUV slammed head-on by a fast moving Amtrak train. First responders arrived on the scene, and confirmed the worst.
Police say Henriquez of Oakland was in that SUV with her 3 year old daughter, Saidy.
Jose Portillo, a relative, says the family is devastated he calls Henriquez a dedicated, hard-working mom. He says she was on her way to pick up her son, who has autism, but she didn't arrive, and police were called.
The Amtrak Capitol Corridor Train No. 532 had 39 passengers on board and was heading northbound from San Jose to Sacramento when it crashed into the dark SUV with a woman and young child inside. Officials said none of the passengers aboard the train were injured.
The SUV was caught on the tracks with no way to escape. ""It appears that the vehicle that was struck today was trapped in traffic. It was stuck there prior to the railroad arms going down and was unable to get off the tracks safely before it was impacted at a high rate of speed by the Amtrak train,"" San Leandro Police Department Lt. Bob McManus said.
""I have two kids, and it just hurts my heart you know,"" said San Leandro resident Jackie Moniz.
Moniz said she's always careful near this rail crossing.

A train quickly sped by and 18-year-old Brittney Silva did not get out of the way. The accident happened next to her home in San Leandro on Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive.
Witnesses say she had earbuds on and when they yelled out a warning, there was no reaction. She couldn't hear it.
Brittney's mother, Cynthia Silva, said, ""I need her to come back and I need these youngsters to take their headphones out of their dang ears. She was listening to music. She had both of her headphones in and she was texting.""
Cynthia showed us what she thinks happened to her daughter Brittney as the teen walked across the train tracks near their San Leandro home just before 6 p.m. Monday night.
""And she's looking down like this and you can't see the arms come down behind her. And the arms came down behind her, she had her headphones in and she couldn't hear the train coming,"" said Cynthia.
Brittney died instantly when an Amtrak train hit her at a high speed on at the intersection of Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive, just a few yards from her family's apartment. Because of the earbuds, Brittney didn't hear a witness yell for her to get out of the way.
Cynthia made a public plea to other young people, ""I will tell all of the other youngsters out there. When you're walking down the street, and you've got your headphones on, keep one headphone in and one out so you can hear the world around you.""
Brittney was a senior at San Leandro High school, all set to go to the prom this weekend and graduate in June.
""She was just always so nice and complimenting people all the people all the time. She's so outgoing and loving. This is such a tragic thing to happen for someone who is so special,"" said Lilian McLean, a friend.
At San Leandro High, students signed a big sheet of paper with their condolences to Brittney's family, including her mother and 11-year-old sister.
""Everyone loved her, everyone knew her, she would always dance and she would always give me great advice about life,"" said Melody Silva, Brittney's sister.

ABC7 News has covered train fatalities at the same railroad crossing before, but this victim lived in a bottom floor apartment across the street. You would think she would be highly aware of the dangers, but even we were surprised at how quickly the train flies through the area. You cannot afford to be distracted.
Brittney Silva, 18, routinely crossed these train tracks, next to her home at Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive. But this time witnesses say the senior at San Leandro High School was distracted.
Witness Cindy Lu says her friend tried to warn her. She said, ""He yelled. He screamed so loud, he was nervous, he screamed so loud, but she doesn't hear because she had a phone to her ear.""
Cynthia Silva, Brittney's mother, told ABC7 News, ""She wanted to be an OBGYN. She wanted to help bring babies into this world."" She says her daughter was the strong one in a home where she admits they had challenges. She said the things she would miss most were: ""her smile, her hugs, her, the way she used to soothe me when I was upset.""
""She turned her grades around and made it possible. She got into UC Santa Cruz and she got into Humboldt, and Cal State East Bay. Just a few years ago that wouldn't have been possible,"" San Leandro High School assistant principal Elisa Alvarez said.

Remembering Sam Raushenbush
Friends and family are invited to share memories of the young man who died in a train accident Friday morning.
Bright, funny, and gregarious, Sam Raushenbush, 20, lived life against the grain, according to his older brother, Nick.
""Sam knew how to be happy, which was to just go and do whatever he wanted to do.""
Sam Raushenbush died Friday morning, when he was struck by an while he was apparently spraying graffiti in the area with a friend. It was his 20th birthday, which he had planned to celebrate later with friends at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Sam grew up in San Diego and later Piedmont, where his father, Richard Raushenbush is currently a member of the school board.
From Berkeley to Cochella, across the country, and even traveling abroad in Italy, Sam touched lives everywhere he went with his energy and humor. Nick said Sam's Facebook page was ""streaming"" yesterday with non-stop posts from hundreds of friends mourning their loss.
Sam's mother died when he was 11, and he had struggled with addiction as a teen, but, said Nick, ""he came out on top.""
He had delivered a hilarious speech as the class speaker for the class of 2009 at the Oakley School, a therapeutic boarding school in Utah, and had been accepted to UC Santa Cruz, his dream college.
Sam recently wrote a candid column for the Huffington Post about his decision to move to Berkeley after his freshman year to take time off from college and experience the ""real world"" after getting caught up in the party scene.
He wanted to spend this year close to his family, but had planned to return to Santa Cruz next fall. He was looking forward to a career in writing, interviewing hip hop for a music blog.
A big Golden Gate Warriors fan, Sam played basketball weekly in San Ramon. He'd played ultimate frisbee and made it to the state championships with his high school cross country team.
Sam's short life, Nick said, ""It's an epic tale. ... He packed more into his life than most people can in a hundred. This kid was a rock star and that's how he should be remembered.""
Along with his many friends, Sam leaves behind his father Richard, step-mother Barbara Giuffre, brother Nick, and ten-year-old half-sister Genevieve.
A memorial service and celebration has been scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 10. All the details have been posted here: http://patch.com/E-ZS7

A woman escaped without injury after her vehicle became stuck at a railroad crossing in eastern Contra Costa County as a train was approaching Sunday, officials said.
Shortly after 5:30 p.m., officers were called to the tracks near Big Break Road and Main Street after the vehicle was struck by the train. When police arrived, they found the woman near the crash site.
According to officers, the woman, who was the only occupant of the vehicle, said the vehicle began experiencing problems as she approached the tracks. The woman drove off the road at one set of tracks and became stuck on the tracks.
Soon after, the woman saw the approaching train, which prompted her to leave the vehicle. Police said the woman's vehicle had ""major damage"" from the train strike.
It does not appear that intoxication played a role in the collision, police said. The investigation has been turned over to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway police.

The incident occurred at 5:33 pm at Main Street at Big Break Road when a train struck a silver sedan causing major damage and shutting down the roadway.
According to preliminary information, two occupants of the vehicle were able to exit the vehicle prior to the train striking the vehicle according to police . A short-time later, Contra Costa County Fire arrived on scene and checked the train for injuries. One occupant sustained minor injuries and was released at scene. No other person sustained injuries.
As of 6:09 pm, the area was shut down to traffic in both directions leaving the Vintage Parkway Neighborhood with one exit.
It is not yet known why the vehicle was stopped on the train tracks. Oakley Police have not yet released any information on the incident.
UPDATE: City of Oakley
At 5:33PM on January 19, 2025, Oakley officers were dispatched to the railroad tracks at Big Break Road and Main Street to investigate a vehicle that had been struck by a train. Our officers arrived and found a female near the collision site. Our officers determined the female was the driver, and sole occupant of the vehicle, and she began experiencing vehicle problems as she was approaching the tracks.
The female drove off of the road right at one set of the tracks, seemingly in an attempt to move her vehicle off of the road. The vehicle became stuck on the tracks because of this movement. The female saw a train was coming at her while she was stuck so she got out of her vehicle to avoid injury, or worse. The train hit the vehicle causing major damage to the vehicle.
It did not appear as if there were any intoxication issues associated with this incident, but investigation was turned over to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway Police Department for investigation.
Please make sure that when pulling over near train tracks, you have cleared the actual tracks. We encourage you to save the train emergency hotline number for the BNSF Resource Operations Call Center, 1-800-832-5452, in your phone or in your glovebox. The center is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The East Contra Costa County Fire Protection District said the incident was reported at around 1 p.m. after a car carrying five people was struck by a train while attempting to cross the tracks at an unprotected railroad crossing.
Three people in the car were killed at the scene, while two others, including a child, were injured, the fire service told NBC's KNTV, based in San Jose, California. One person was flown to hospital via air ambulance, while the child was transported to the same hospital over ground, it said.
The fire service said the Contra Costa Sheriff's office was handling an investigation into the deadly incident.
In a statement shared with NBC News, Amtrak confirmed train 713 had ""made contact with a vehicle that was obstructing the track in Knightsen.""
It said there were no reported injuries to the 89 passengers or crew onboard the train. The train was delayed for around three hours while authorities investigated the incident, Amtrak said.
The company said it was working with local law enforcement and BNSF Railway, the track owner, to investigate the incident.
Amtrak did not directly comment on the fatalities related to the incident.
However, it said that trespassing along railroad rights-of-way was the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, while railroad crossing incidents were the second leading cause, citing the Federal Railroad Administration.
""These incidents can affect everyone involved — those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers,"" Amtrak said.
""They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and crossings,"" it said.
Two people were killed in Houston in April after the car they were in crashed into an Amtrak train after the driver attempted to beat the train at a railroad crossing, according to police.
In that crash, the driver of the vehicle drove around the crossing arms signaling an approaching train, before colliding with the train, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.
The car was engulfed in flames on impact and the driver and the passenger were ejected from the vehicle.

""I got children that go to school right over here in Delta Vista [Middle School],"" said Edward Harris, a witness.
Oakley resident Niecy McGee was also saddened by the tragedy.

Chief Ross Macumber with the East Contra Costa Fire District told NBC Bay Area Wednesday that this was the third time this year that his crews have responded collisions involving a train and a car.
""If the crossing arms are down, don’t ever try and beat a train,"" he said. ""They are down for a reason. The trains come through at a high rate of speed and they don’t stop for a long time. Never try and beat a train.""
McGee raised her concern about the tracks.
""I don’t know what the solution is, more signs?"" she said. ""We have kids that walk those tracks every day to and from school.""

OAKLEY, Contra Costa County (CBS SF) -- A freight train hit a vehicle on the tracks in Oakley Wednesday, killing a 12-year-old boy and critically injuring a woman.
The collision happened at about 12:53 p.m. at a railroad crossing at E. Cypress Road just east of Main St.
A 19-year-old woman was airlifted to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek with critical injuries while three other people were taken by ambulance to area hospitals, according to Fire Marshal Steve Aubert with the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District.
On Wednesday afternoon, Oakley Union Elementary School District Superintendent Jeff Palmquist said in a letter to parents that the victim was a student at Delta Vista Middle School, a block away from the railroad crossing.
A witness said it appeared a grey Lexus SUV tried to beat the train after the railroad crossing arms were coming down and was struck in the rear portion of the vehicle. At least one other vehicle was hit in the collision.

The shaken witness said she was in a truck one vehicle away from the crash directly in front of her.
""As the car went through the gates went down and its ass end was still sitting in the train tracks. The train went through and then all of a sudden I just heard a big crunch and I looked over and the car flew off the road and then the tires were going and there was debris hitting my truck - and I called 9-1-1,"" said the unidentified witness. ""It was sickening. Just scary.""
Another witness said he also saw the crash from inside his own vehicle.
""I saw a big cloud of dust and then I saw the train come to a grinding halt, and then everybody got out and started - it was obviously some attention being paid,"" said witness Edward Harris. ""So I get up and got out of my car and I looked and I saw the SUV sitting there. Everything had just happened so we all got out and I called 9-1-1.""
Harris said he thought about his own children after learning of the young victim involved in the crash.
It's heartbreaking. I've got children who go to school right over here at Delta Vista [Middle School],"" he said. ""I heard that there was a younger person that was reportedly involved and my heart just goes out to the family and I'm just praying for them. ""
LaQuan Ashford, who has a child at Delta Vista told KPIX 5, ""I go stand at that track and wait for my daughter to cross because of that reason. There's always a train crossing during their school time.""
Ashford said train traffic is such a problem that he has reached out to have the city set some limits on trains coming through the area, especially during pick up and drop off hours.
""There is a long line all the way across. So everyone is sitting bumper to bumper waiting to get to this light,"" Ashford said. ""So the train, coming at that time, anyone can get stuck on the track. Anyone, at any given time.""
Oakley city officials said they have implemented road striping changes and adjusted the timing of the traffic signals to ease congestion.
The East Contra Costa Fire Protection District treated three other victims and released them at the scene.
It was the third train crash in East Contra Costa County this year and the second in one week. On Aug. 20, an Amtrak passenger train collided with a big rig in Brentwood resulting in a minor injury. In May, a truck parked on the tracks was hit by a train in Orwood, resulting in an injury to the driver.
""If the crossing arms are down, don't ever try to beat a train. They're down for a reason,"" said ECCFPD Battalion Chief Ross Macumber. ""The train comes through at a high rate of speed and they don't stop for a long time. So never try to beat a train, never drive around the crossing arm, and if it's an uncontrolled train intersection, always turn off your radio, roll down your window and listen and look before you cross.""",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,12:53 p.m.,Unknown,East Contra Costa Fire Protection District,Contra Costa,CA,Unknown,E.

KGW-TV reports the accident occurred about 7:50 p.m. in Silvana, about 45 miles north of Seattle, and involved Cascades train 519 from Vancouver, B.C., to Seattle. The engineer was treated and released at a hospital after part of the tree went through the windshield of the train’s cab car. No other injuries were reported. The 48 people on board were given alternate transportation to their trip.
The train involved is one of two Talgo Series 8 trainsets owned by the state of Oregon. Older Talgo Series VI trains owned by Amtrak and Washington state were removed from service in 2019 in reaction to findings regarding a fatal 2017 derailment involving one of the trains [see “WSDOT prepares to remove Talgo Series 6 …,” Trains News Wire, May 24, 2019].
The Northwest was hit Tuesday by a storm described as “bomb cyclone,” bringing winds of more than 70 mph and knocking out power to more than 360,000 customers in Washington and British Columbia, CNN reports. At least two people have been killed.
The storm led to the cancellation of the Coast Starlight in both directions between Seattle and Oakland, Calif, on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and the Empire Builder in both directions between Seattle and Spokane, Wash., and Portland, Ore, and Spokane on Wednesday. The eastbound Builder sections between Seattle/Portland and Spokane have also been cancelled today (Nov. 21), according to an Amtrak advisory. The westbound Builder scheduled to arrive in Seattle/Portland on Nov. 19 had previously been cancelled west of Spokane.

Three people, including a 6-year-old boy, have died after the truck they were in was struck by an Amtrak train in New York, officials confirmed.
On Friday, May 17, the passenger train heading northbound from New York City to Niagara Falls hit the truck in North Tonawanda, resulting in the deaths of a man, 69, a woman, 66, and a boy, 6, according to statements from the North Tonawanda Police Department and Amtrak.
The names of the victims, who were pronounced dead at the scene, have not yet been released, as the crash is still being investigated.
Police said the train hit the victims’ Dodge pickup truck at 7:56 p.m. local time in North Tonawanda, a city in Niagara County about 13 miles from the Canadian border.
Amtrak told CBS News and CNN in a statement that the car was sitting on the tracks at the time of the crash.
""There have been no reported injuries to the 21 passengers or crew onboard. Amtrak is working with local law enforcement to investigate the incident,"" the spokesperson told CBS.
North Tonawanda Professional Firefighters Local 1333 wrote in a Facebook post that crew members from Platoon 4 responded to the crash site at the intersection of Felton Street and River Road, where they attempted to rescue three passengers in the car from the crash for around two hours.
The firefighters initially attempted to resuscitate the passengers, but later stopped after they were pronounced dead at the scene, North Tonawanda police captain Daryl Truty wrote in the statement.

A train collision in Kingsburg, southeast of Fresno, on April 18 resulted in the death of an SUV driver. The collision happened on the tracks at Golden State Boulevard and Stroud Avenue around 9:00 p.m. The Kingsburg Police Department reported that the train struck the SUV on the tracks and continued going south.

Railroad Liability in a Train Collision With a Motor Vehicle
In a collision between a train and a motor vehicle, determining the liability of railroad companies can involve examining whether the railroad company adhered to safety regulations and exercised due diligence in maintaining and operating its trains and tracks. Factors such as the functionality of crossing signals and barriers, the conduct of the train operator, and the maintenance of the railroad tracks play crucial roles in establishing liability following a car accident injury or fatality. Additionally, legal considerations might include examining the railroad’s efforts to warn the public of potential dangers and their compliance with federal and state rail safety laws.
Filing a Wrongful Death Claim Against a Railroad or Track Owner
Filing a wrongful death claim against a railroad or track owner following a train collision requires navigating intricate federal and state regulations. To initiate such a claim, it is important to establish the railroad or track owner’s liability by proving negligence or a violation of safety standards that led to the fatal incident. Evidence gathering plays a critical role in this phase, including collecting accident reports, eyewitness accounts, and expert testimonies related to railway safety and operations.
Engaging with an attorney who is experienced in railroad accidents can significantly improve the chances of a successful outcome by ensuring that the legal rights of the deceased’s estate and beneficiaries are effectively represented.
Recovering Compensation by Filing a Wrongful Death Claim in California
In California, filing a wrongful death claim after a train collision allows the decedent’s surviving relatives or estate to seek various types of compensation. These compensatory damages are designed to provide financial relief and acknowledge the intangible losses suffered due to a loved one’s untimely death. The types of compensation that may be recovered include:
- Funeral and burial costs: The family can recover the expenses associated with funeral services and burial or cremation.
- Lost wages plus benefits: Financial support that accounts for the wages and benefits the deceased should have earned had they lived until retirement is recoverable.
- Loss of love, companionship, and support: Monetary recognition is possible for the loss of emotional support, companionship, affection, and guidance the deceased provided.
- Punitive damages: In some cases, if the actions leading to death were particularly egregious, punitive damages may be awarded to punish the wrongdoer and deter similar conduct in the future.
Each of these categories represents a critical component of the total compensation pursued in a wrongful death claim in California, offering a semblance of financial stability and justice for the survivors. However, in California, the train collision claim must be filed within two years, which represents the statute of limitations. Because witnesses move away and evidence can disappear in that time period, enlisting the help of a wrongful death lawyer soon afterward improves the family’s chance at recovering the compensation they deserve.

Fatal Train Crash Statistics
According to the National Transportation Safety Board, pedestrians die in railway accidents more often than in collisions with cars. Faulty warning systems, outdated or absent safety equipment, and dangerous crossings cause the most deadly train accidents.
About every two hours, a train collides with someone or a car. Each year, more than a thousand people are killed in train accidents. There were about 2,300 injuries and 600 fatalities as a result.
Trains are the most effective form of transportation. The skills of the conductors and how frequently repairs are made are factors that affect employee and passenger safety. Passengers are at risk due to their negligence or inadequate shortcuts.
Over 7,200 people have died in US train accidents since 1997. Trains colliding with pedestrians on American railroads are currently the leading cause of fatalities, outpacing all other factors.
Derailments, worn-out tracks, contempt for safety regulations, lax security, and other factors are typically to blame for railway accidents.
What To Do After an Accident
When you get involved in a collision, it is crucial to contact the appropriate authorities immediately. Don’t provide any assumptions when being questioned. Simply tell them what happened.
Even though they had nothing to do with the incident, the victim may nonetheless feel responsible for it. Such behaviors can provide the insurance company with an excuse to reject the claim.
If you formally request it, the relevant authorities must give you a copy of the report. If you’d like us to submit the request for you, please fill out our online form. As soon as we have the report, we’ll get started on your case. Get a free evaluation of your insurance claims right now.

KINGSBURG, Calif. (KFSN) -- A man died in Kingsburg after a freight train hit his semi-truck on Thursday, sparking flames and explosions.
The crash happened on the railway tracks in the area of Sierra and Simpson just off Highway 99.
The resulting blast was so intense that parts of the engine went flying feet away and the safety arm that lowers when a train is approaching was blown off.
The driver of the truck did not survive. The train crew was not injured.
A witness, Mickey P, said he saw the semi-truck on the railway track and the train crossing-arms come down on its hood.
Moments later, the train crashed into the truck, sparking flames and an explosion.
""It was instant, just 'boom'... catastrophic!"" Mickey P told Action News.
Footage from the scene shows thick black smoke billowing in huge clouds, visible from miles away.
The police department still doesn't know how or why the semi-truck driver didn't get off the tracks before being hit.

Tuesday night was supposed to be a time for joy - the kickoff to Christmas Tree Lane's twinkling lights, holiday music, and wooden reindeer, but the holiday cheer has turned into a memory of pain for one grieving family in Fresno.
A child was killed after a family's minivan was hit by an Amtrak train as the family waited in line to enter the lane.
The crash happened at Shields and Maroa at 5:30 pm.
The impact sent three other family members, including the child's mother, to the Community Regional Medical Center with minor injuries.
The devastating turn of events happened when the family's car got stuck on the tracks while waiting just feet from the entrance to the iconic holiday light display.
The Amtrak train, which had 50 passengers inside, crashed into the stuck car.
First responders arrived and provided aid, but the child died.
None of the Amtrak passengers were injured. The train was headed to Bakersfield and has since continued on with its route.
Investigators are trying to determine how the minivan got stuck on the tracks.
Stunned witnesses shared their shock and grief after helplessly watching the van get stuck on the tracks.

(FOX26) — Over 24 hours later, a Fresno family is heartbroken following the tragic death of a 5-year-old boy on opening night of Christmas Tree Lane.
On Tuesday, the Fresno Police Department says a family was waiting in line for their turn to take in the lights.
In the van was a family of four: a mother, a grandmother, and two small children.
They were just about to reach the entrance of Christmas Tree Lane when tragedy struck.
Police say the mother thought she had cleared the train tracks, but an investigation shows there was still a big portion of the van in harm's way.
""From the video, from the pictures that we see it looks like just about a foot of the rear end of a 2018 Dodge Caravan was sticking on a southbound track,"" explained Fresno Police Department Deputy Chief Michael Reid.
As a train raced at more than 70 miles an hour, it crashed into the back of the van, killing 5-year-old Anton Solorio in the backseat on impact.
""Those things going that fast and this was six cars in one locomotive carrying about 70 passengers, it takes a while to stop.""

Anton's mother, grandmother, and 22-month-old brother were taken to a local hospital following the crash with minor injuries.
His brother and grandmother have been released, but his 7-month-pregnant mother remains in the hospital to ensure the baby is okay, according to a close family friend.
FOX26 News went digging through the Federal Railroad Administration records to see how many other crashes there have been at the Shields railroad crossing.
We found there have been 5 other accidents since 2002.
Out of all 6 crashes, three adults have died, with the latest now claiming the life of a child.
""The is a tragedy, it's an avoidable tragedy. Our heart goes out to that family we'll support them any way we can but more importantly, I want to prevent this from happening again,"" said Reid.
A GoFundMe account has been set up to help with the funeral expenses for Anton.

The force of the crash killed a 5-year-old boy, identified by the Fresno County Sheriff's Office as Anton Solorio.
On Wednesday, area residents were still in shock, trying to understand what went wrong on the tracks.
""To hear something like this, it's a rip in the fabric of our universe,"" says John Alden.
Adds Debi Ruud:
""We couldn't even imagine how it can happen.""
The cause of the crash is still under investigation.
But Fresno Police say it appears the railroad signals were working at the time and that the train engineer applied the brakes and used the horn.
They believe the boy's mother was driving the van and simply thought she had cleared the tracks when she hadn't.
""It's a tragedy, it's an unnecessary loss of life, and it's something that's absolutely avoidable so we just need to remind motorists about safety,"" says Fresno Police Deputy Chief Michael Reid.

JD Sanders lives nearby, and is still processing what he saw and heard last night, hoping it never happens again.
""I ran down there and heard the mother screaming and I had to come back to my house because it was too much for me,"" he says. ""It's pretty terrible.""
Sanders called 911, and by the time he went back outside, police were everywhere.
The boy's mother, who is pregnant, was brought to the hospital to get checked out.
His grandmother and younger sibling were in the car too and also expected to be ok.
On Wednesday, Valerie Espinoza stopped by the scene to pay her respects to the little boy who passed away.
""I just came to bring some balloons because I felt very bad for the child, you know he's a baby,"" she said.
She also shared an important reminder for all families.
""Just cherish life because life is so precious.""
Fresno Police are reminding everyone that trains pass through the intersection frequently, and that they move fast, and take a long time to stop.
The train was going at approximately 70 miles per hour.
Robert Solorio, Anton's father, released a statement to Action News about the family's heartbreaking loss.

Officers say at least one of those family members is the child's mother.

Both sides of Shields Avenue have been closed, from Maroa Avenue to the train tracks.
Just on the other side of those tracks is the entrance for Christmas Tree Lane at Shields and Van Ness Blvd.

A CHP officer backed up right before the train barreled through.
""I was really lucky. I never thought anything like that would ever happen,' said Batti.

City Council Member Joe Rivero addressed the dangerous intersection at the council meeting just a day before the accident.

Regrettably, a day and a half later an accident occurs there. Thankfully no one was injured.""
""They have to get rid of the center dividers-- it's too high,"" said Batti.

""Our information is the collision occurred about 80 feet down the railroad track toward Oxnard. It had to travel there somehow. It was not stuck, bottomed out on the track or something like that, it had actually traveled down the railroad track itself,"" said Robert Sumwalt with the National Transportation Safety Board.
About 2,100 crossing accident occur each year, but Tuesday's derailment drew NTSB attention because the truck was found having driven down the tracks. Investigators are expected to remain on scene for five to seven days.
""Our objective is to collect perishable evidence,"" Sumwalt added. ""We are not here to speculate. We never speculate at the NTSB. We're not here on scene to determine the cause of the accident. We're not here on scene to analyze. I know everybody wants to know what happened, and we will determine that, but our goal here is to collect that information that will go away with the passage of time.""
As part of the investigation, NTSB plans to do a sight distance test, which means they will set up a mock situation to see how far down the track each person could actually see from both the train and pickup truck.
The NTSB is also looking at video and data equipment on the train that should reveal the moments before the crash.
PHOTOS: Metrolink commuter train derails in Oxnard
Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, 55, of Yuma, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of felony hit-and-run after a Metrolink train headed toward Los Angeles struck his large pickup truck, which was hauling a trailer, on the tracks in Oxnard. He was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday.
Information from the control cab showed the train engineer managed to hit the brakes early, but could not avoid the crash.
Ramirez's lawyer Ron Bamieh called the collision an ""accident."" Ramirez was driving his company's truck and trailer. He has been employed by the same produce trucking company, The Grower's Company, Inc., for 12 years.
""The arrest of Mr. Ramirez is the unfortunate result of law enforcement attempting to cast blame on a man who was caught in a tragic situation with no way to stop the oncoming tragedy. He does not know how or why the truck he was driving stopped on the tracks, and wishes there was something he could have done to prevent this accident,"" Bamieh said.
Bamieh added that his office's investigation showed that Ramirez's truck did become ""entangled and unable to move off the railroad tracks. The truck and the trailer were somehow stuck.""
About 50 people were on board. Twenty-eight people were taken to a hospital, including four in critical condition. No fatalities were reported.
On Wednesday, clean-up efforts continued. All derailed cars had been removed from scene. Track repairs and crossing light and arm function checks were ongoing. Authorities were hoping to get the site cleaned up by the end of the day.
Commuting around the area
Delays were expected for commuters traveling near the crash area.
Metrolink riders for Ventura County Line Trains 102, 104 and 106 will be bused around the crash site between the Camarillo, Oxnard or Ventura-East stations and the Moorpark station. Regularly scheduled service resumes for passengers traveling between Los Angeles Union Station and Moorpark station.

- Share via
The wife of the driver who was arrested after his truck was hit by a Metrolink train, which then derailed, defended her husband and said the couple was grieving over the recent death of their daughter.
Lucila Sanchez said her husband, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Ariz., didn’t want to go to California and begged his employer to stay in Arizona. The couple’s 29-year-old daughter died in July of cancer. They also have a son.
“He said, ‘I don’t want to go,’ ” she said in an interview Tuesday with the L.A. Times. But Sanchez-Ramirez, a mechanic for 12 years with a harvesting company, headed to a job site in Oxnard early Tuesday, where the fiery collision occurred.
On Wednesday, his attorney said he didn’t think Sanchez-Ramirez’s grief played a role in the crash and was not a factor in his driving.
His wife described Tuesday’s events this way: His truck unexpectedly stalled on the tracks. He noticed the train was fast approaching and tried to restart the engine. But his attempts were unsuccessful, so he jumped out of his truck.
But investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board say it appeared his truck was not stuck and that he had been driving on the tracks for some distance.
Sanchez-Ramirez was taken into custody on suspicion of hit-and-run after being found in a disoriented state wandering more than a mile and a half from the scene of the train derailment, said Jason Benites, assistant chief of the Oxnard Police Department.
Police have held him on suspicion of hit-and-run involving multiple people.
“It’s not his fault,” Lucila Sanchez insisted.
His attorney Ron Bamieh said Wednesday the crash was an accident.
Sanchez-Ramirez was not familiar with Oxnard, so he went to the area to check it out before a meeting Wednesday, he said.
Working off a printed Google map, he “mis-perceived the tracks to be the road” and became entangled, his attorney said.
As the train approached, Sanchez-Ramirez hit his high beams to get the train’s attention and even tried to push his 2005 Ford F-450 off the tracks, his attorney said. Unable to find a way to move his truck, “he was then forced to flee to save his own life,” he said.
After the crash, Lucila Sanchez said her husband called their son. Immediately after hearing about the crash, his family left their home in Arizona and made it to Oxnard by morning, she said.
She wasn’t sure if or when he would be released from police custody.
“He is tense,” she said Tuesday. “He is nervous.”
After the arrest, Bamieh said he met with Sanchez-Ramirez and that, who instead of asking about his case, he was focused on the passengers and their injuries.
His attorney described him as a good, hard-working man. The Arizona resident owns a home in Yuma.
After his daughter died of cancer, he and his wife had been helping their son-in-law take care of her children, his attorney said.
Sanchez-Ramirez was working with the Growers Co. in Somerton, Ariz. A statement from the company, where he has worked for 12 years, said he was a good employee and a good family man who posed no risk or danger to the community.
Sanchez-Ramirez, who has a valid Arizona commercial license, told police his pickup truck and trailer got “stuck” at an Oxnard railroad crossing moments before the explosive crash.
There were no fatalities in the 5:46 a.m. derailment, but 28 of the 50 people involved in the crash were rushed to hospitals with injuries such as broken limbs, head trauma and back and neck pain, according to emergency crews.
Arizona criminal records show that Sanchez-Ramirez pleaded guilty on Dec. 2, 1998, to a host of violations in a single case, including driving with a blood alcohol content above 0.08%, the legal limit in the state; failure to obey a police officer; having liquor with a minor on the premises and having no insurance.
In 2004, Sanchez-Ramirez was convicted of a local driving infraction in Yuma, and in 2007 he was cited for failure to obey a traffic-control device.

train accident in Wasco, California, took a horrifying twist as a man was arrested for consuming the severed leg of a pedestrian who had been fatally struck by the train. The Kern County Sheriff's Office has launched an investigation into the disturbing incident, which has left the community in disbelief.
The incident occurred at the local Amtrak station in Wasco, situated approximately 25 miles northwest of Bakersfield. According to authorities, a pedestrian was struck by a passing train, resulting in their untimely death and the severing of one of their legs.
Eyewitnesses were left stunned as they watched the perpetrator, identified as 27-year-old Resendo Tellez, brazenly approach the scene of the accident. In wild footage captured by onlookers, Tellez can be seen closely inspecting the severed leg, even appearing to sniff it, before callously absconding with the gruesome evidence.
Despite the presence of law enforcement officers and bewildered bystanders, Tellez showed no signs of remorse or concern. He reportedly waved casually at cameras as he made his escape, swinging the severed leg with nonchalance.
Tellez was swiftly apprehended by authorities and now faces multiple charges, including the theft of evidence from the accident scene, in addition to outstanding warrants. Meanwhile, the identity of the victim remains undisclosed, pending notification of their next of kin.
The Kern County Sheriff's Office is continuing its investigation into the tragic incident, grappling with the disturbing circumstances surrounding the fatal train accident and the bizarre actions of the perpetrator.

Fatal Train Crash Statistics
According to the National Transportation Safety Board, pedestrians die in railway accidents more often than in collisions with cars. Faulty warning systems, outdated or absent safety equipment, and dangerous crossings cause the most deadly train accidents.
About every two hours, a train collides with someone or a car. Each year, more than a thousand people are killed in train accidents. There were about 2,300 injuries and 600 fatalities as a result.
Trains are the most effective form of transportation. The skills of the conductors and how frequently repairs are made are factors that affect employee and passenger safety. Passengers are at risk due to their negligence or inadequate shortcuts.
Over 7,200 people have died in US train accidents since 1997. Trains colliding with pedestrians on American railroads are currently the leading cause of fatalities, outpacing all other factors.
Derailments, worn-out tracks, contempt for safety regulations, lax security, and other factors are typically to blame for railway accidents.

There were reportedly 53 passengers on board the train at the time of the accident. Kings County Fire Department Battalion Chief Rick Smith said no one was injured. He said one person complained of minor injuries, but refused medical treatment.
California Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Adam Barresi said the driver of the forklift was traveling eastbound on Lansing Avenue around 8:30 a.m. when the forklift suddenly stalled on the tracks. He said the driver was unable to get the vehicle to restart.
Barresi said when the northbound train began approaching and the crossing arms started to come down, the driver then jumped off the forklift and ran.
The train was delayed for about two hours.
“The train was held for an investigation then released and allowed to proceed on its way at approximately 10:30 a.m.,” Craig Schulz, Amtrak spokesman, said.

They were the first on the scene when they rushed to help rescue passengers.
Raymie Howard, 23, Andy Saiz, 31, and Leslie Saiz, 39, were in the back yard area of their home — empty fields bordering Kansas Avenue and 10th Avenue, just south of Hanford — when a semi truck with two trailers hauling cotton trash hit the last car of an Amtrak train heading to Bakersfield.
“I was just standing in the back yard while one of the other guys was on the quad when BOOM,” Howard said. “It looked like the whole back train was on fire.”
But what looked like smoke turned out to be black, thick dust.
The crash injured about 40 of the train’s 170 passengers, but none seriously. Even the driver of the truck suffered only minor injuries.
“I ran over there. It was incredible,” Howard said. “That truck was going west but after hitting the back end of the train, it flipped 180 degrees and ended up facing the opposite way.”
Howard and the Saiz brothers were the first on the scene at the railroad crossing on Kansas Avenue. The glanced at the train, they said, and saw it “wobbling” down the tracks.
“Everything was gone. His engine was gone. The cab of the truck was gone. All that was left was one small bubble where the driver sat,” Howard said. “The dude was just sitting there, not making any noise. He wasn’t responding — he was unconscious.”
A few seconds later, the man began to moan.
“I didn’t want to touch him. Just then a probation officer pulled up and said the train had just derailed,” Howard said. “He was checking the truck driver and hehad merun up thetracks looking to see if any passengers had been thrown out of the train. We never saw anyone along the way.”
But as they approached thederailed train,thesight was frightening.
“People were coming out with broken arms and broken legs — you could tell just by looking at them andthewaytheyheldtheir [limbs.] There was a lot of crying. Even people who were not hurt were all crying,” Howardsaid.“Everyone was freaking out.”
Howard said he saw a lady with a crying month-old baby covered in what appeared to be black soot and dirt.
“It scared me. I took off my shirt and gave it to the lady to clean the baby’s face up,” Howard said. “The baby was not even hers. She had picked it up and was looking for the mother.”
Andy Saiz said he was on the quad, heard the hit, andlookeduptoseeahuge cloud of dust.
“It was so thick, I could not see in front of me. It was bad,” Andy Saiz said. “I was shocked. There was no motor left to the truck. It was gone. The drivers’ feet were hanging off the bottom of the cab that was now gone. I kept shouting ‘Can you hear me?’ but got no response.”
Saiz rushed to the train and saw a lady with a broken arm, he said.
“The [passengers] were coming out of the doors and getting pulled out of windows,” Andy Saiz said. “There were a lot of old ladies and old men covered in black dirt.”
LeslieSaiz said hetalked to one of the men.
“His face was all bloody and he had dirt and glass all over his face so I ran to help him,” Leslie Saiz said. “He said he was sitting looking out the window as thetrain was crossing [Kansas Avenue.] He saw the truck and the way he told it, the truck only slowed. It did not stop completely.”
Leslie Saiz said the passenger told him hethought the driver miscalculated the train’s passing.
“It seemed like he slowed to let the train pass but then either he sped up or the train slowed, and the truck hit the last train car,” Leslie Saiz said. “At least that’s what it sounded like.”
The collision occurred a few minutes after noon on Monday — with the first 9-1-1 call received at 12:22 p.m., said Jerry Pierce, California Highway Patrol Public Affairs Officer, Hanford office.
“Two minutes later we got an updatethat thetrain wasinfactanAmtraktrain and that some of the cars had partially overturned,” Pierce said.
Thecollision was reported as occurring on Kansas Avenue at the rail road crossing, between 10th and 10 and a half.
“The train came to rest about two football fields past the point of impact,” Pierce said.
The driver was pulling two trailers of ‘cotton trash’ and had minor to moderate injuries.
As Pierce checked on the driver, emergency personnel had been on the scene for an approximate 30 minutes.
“The majority of the passengers were checked and treated just outside the train,” Pierce said.
Brett Blanchard, who was identified as the engineer of the Amtrak passenger train that collided with the semitrailer, did not appear to be injured.
Pierce placed an initial report of an approximate 150 to 200 passengers on the train, which had just leftHanfordandwasheading to Bakersfield.
“The initial report of the injured is between 30 and 50,” Pierce said. “Most of the injuries are minor. I have not heard of any major or severe injuries. No one was transported by lifeline — indicating serious injuries — away from the scene.”
Pierce also praised the prompt help from numerous entities, including Kings County Sheriff, Hanford Police Department,Kings County Probation, Kings County District Attorney’s Office, Kings County Fire Department and fire volunteers, Hanford Fire Department and volunteers, and other fire personnel.
Numerous ambulances responded to the site and a triage area sorted passengers based on their need for immediate medical treatment.
The injured were transported to hospitals in Hanford, Tulare and Visalia.

A Metrolink train struck a car in the City of Industry on Thursday morning, killing two people inside the vehicle, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirmed.
Metrolink Train 407 hit a white Toyota Camry on the tracks near the intersection of Rose Hills Road and Capitol Avenue, killing Grecia Garcia Sofia, 19; and Pamela Gutierrez Guizar, 47, according to L.A. County medical examiner records. The train was traveling between the Industry and Montebello/Commerce stations when it struck the car at 8 a.m. Thursday, according to Metrolink.
Two other people were taken to a hospital with moderate injuries, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Authorities didn’t say how they were involved in the accident.
Five train passengers reported non-life-threatening injuries from the crash, according to Metrolink. Though two trains were canceled after the accident, the agency said, customers were offered transportation alternatives and the schedule for the rest of Thursday was not affected.
It was not clear how the car ended up in the path of the oncoming train. Authorities said an investigation is ongoing.
Last October, a pedestrian was killed on Metrolink tracks between Lancaster and Palmdale. The accident occurred in an area without a crossing.

(TNS)
Dec. 19—One person is dead and four are injured after a train derailed Monday in West Texas, according to Town of Pecos City officials.
The city, about 75 miles west of Odessa, said the derailment was caused by a freight train colliding with a tractor-trailer that was stuck on the tracks around 5:45 p.m. After the train collided with the truck, it hit the Chamber of Commerce building near the intersection of Oak Street and Dot Stafford Street, according to a Reeves County statement.
Three of the cars on the train were carrying potentially hazardous material, according to Charles Lino, Pecos' city manager. The city is ""investigating this fluid situation as we cooperate with local first responders."" Lino said there is no risk to the public.
Video of the collision shows the moment the train barreled into the truck.
""This lil' boy is stuck right here on the tracks,"" the witness behind the camera said as he watched the collision from his own vehicle.
""Oh boy, that's not good!"" the witness screamed as the train slammed into the tractor-trailer.
Harrowing video shared on X and Facebook by Reeves County officials shows the aftermath of the crash, including train cars laying beside the tracks. Police, firefighters, ambulances and other vehicles appear to be clearing up the area.
It is not clear how the tractor-trailer became struck on the tracks. Police have not revealed whether the victims were from inside the building, inside the train or pedestrians on the street. The condition of the truck driver is unknown.
The Pecos Police Department is now leading the investigation with support from the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The public has been urged to avoid the area for public safety concerns, authorities said Wednesday night.

A driver was hospitalized Wednesday afternoon after they crashed their vehicle into an LA Metro train in South Los Angeles.
The collision happened in the Florence-Graham neighborhood near the intersection of Nadeau Street and Graham Avenue on the Metro A Line—a segment of railway that is not separated from vehicle traffic.
Metro officials told KTLA that the driver of a black Nissan sedan broke through a crossing gate and hit the northbound A-line train at Nadeau.
Video from Sky5 showed the sedan with heavy front end damage sitting disabled on one set of tracks and the Metro train stopped nearby on another.
Crews could be seen evaluating the damage to the train, and around 12:30 p.m., Metro staff were helping to evacuate riders.
The driver of the vehicle was transported to a local hospital and their condition was not immediately released. No riders on the train were injured, Metro officials said.
The intersection was closed and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department was called to the scene to investigate.
Metro train service was suspended between the Slauson and Firestone stations and buses were being used as an alternative, but Metro announced around 1 p.m. that trains would instead share the Long Beach-bound track and rail service would be resumed.
While much of the LA Metro system is underground or is “grade separated” from traffic, trains do intersect with vehicle traffic on several lines. Metro officials urged drivers to be “rail safe” by looking both ways and paying attention to crossing gates and warning signs.

The Sheboygan County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) said the crash occurred in the west 5100 block of Abbott Drive.
SCSO said when deputies reached the scene of the crash, they found a semi-truck with an attached tanker on its side in a ditch. The truck had been transporting about 5,000 gallons of liquid manure. The semi-truck was traveling west on Abbott Drive and crossed a railway crossing.
As it crossed, the semi-truck was hit by a Wisconsin Southern train traveling north.
SCSO said the semi-truck driver, Jeffery S. Blankenheim, died as a result of the crash. The 66-year-old man was from Kewaskum.
SCSO said no other injuries were reported.
The train’s engine and six of its estimated 22 cars were derailed. Only one derailed car lost some of its plastic pellet contents.
SCSO said the railway crossing did have a yield sign on Abbott Drive. However, there are no lights or gates there.
Donald Vruwink is the railroad commissioner for the state. He said there hasn’t been an accident at this train crossing since 1989, but said it’s not unusual for a something like this to happen in a spot like this.
“In most cases, when we see these accidents happen it’s in these rural areas without gates and lights that just have a yield signs and people get complacent because there are only two trains that come through a day,” Vruwink said.
Lisa Pfund and her grandson, Jackson, live just a few hundred feet from the wreckage. She said she’s always worried this could happen due to vehicles driving excessive speeds on Abbott Drive.
“When I hear it go through at night I just wait for the crash because nobody slows down, nobody stops, nobody yields,” Pfund said.
Vruwink encouraged Wisconsin residents to report excessive speeding near railroad crossings so his team can investigate and find solutions.
With the investigation into the crash is underway, Abbott Drive will be closed westbound from State Highway 57. Vehicles entering from the west will need to turn south on Allen Road. Officials said the investigation could take several days and re-opening would also be dependent on repairs.
SCSO said there’s no hazard or danger to the community at this time.

MANUELITO, N.M. (AP/AZFamily) — The Federal Railroad Administration is now leading the investigation of last month’s fiery train derailment near the Arizona-New Mexico border.
National Transportation Safety Board officials said Thursday that the FRA will determine the probable cause of the April 26 derailment.
NTSB investigators have examined the track and derailed tank cars and will focus on the performance of the tank cars and emergency response actions.
The derailment of an BNSF Railway freight train forced a 50-mile stretch of Interstate 40 to close and led to two days of precautionary evacuations for 52 Manuelito residents who lived within a two-mile radius of the derailment site.
No injuries were reported, McKinley County officials said.
The train had left Belen, New Mexico, and was headed to Phoenix and was traveling about 53 mph at the time of the derailment, well below the maximum authorized speed of 70 mph near the derailment site, NTSB investigators said.
Of the 35 cars that derailed, six tank cars were carrying non-odorous propane, the NTSB said.
Four of the six tank cars were breached and released their contents, which ignited, investigators said. New Mexico State Police Lt. Phil Vargas said some rail cars caught fire and burned for hours after the derailment.
Initial passersby posted video and photos on social media of crumpled train cars and billowing, black smoke.
A fifth tank car carrying propane — a type of liquefied petroleum gas — was exposed to the flames and released vapor through its pressure relief device, investigators said.
Each derailed tank car was carrying about 30,000 gallons of liquefied petroleum gas, according to investigators.
The derailment also led Amtrak to cancel some passenger travel, including on the route between Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico.

A deadly crash involving a Metrolink train in Redlands last April has turned into a lawsuit, as the family of the mother and daughter who were killed say that the commuter rail service was designed at a crossing that is inherently dangerous.
It's been nearly a year since the crash on April 4, 2023 near the Metrolink Arrow Line crossing at Alabama Street, that left Heather Woolard and her 11-year-old daughter Presley Chiakowsky dead.
Still, the community feels the impact of the loss.
""You can't help but feel loss,"" said Dan Arrow, a Redlands resident. ""You think your head, 'How would that be for me?' How would I live afterward if one of my daughters was killed like that?""
The family says that Metrolink and Redlands created dangerous conditions at the crossing, which was started just six months before the fatal incident.
Scott Saunders, the attorney representing the Chiakowsky family, says that they're looking to several potential safety issues, including the timing of how the preemptive warning signals and traffic lights at the crossing are synchronized. Another issue is the close proximity of the gas station driveway to the limit line painted on the road.
""The lawsuit we filed, it's about public safety and doing what we can to prevent this type of tragedy from happening again,"" Saunders said.
On top of the issues, he says that they're learned a deputy chief at Redlands Police Department had reported a potential public safety concern at the crossing to city officials after the collision, even filing a claim about it.
The claim comes after the initial accident report indicated that Heather had backed up at a red light after driving over the limit line, but for unknown reasons, drove forward after the crossing arm came down on top of her car.
In December, Metrolink made an adjustment to the preemptive warning lights at both the Alabama Street and Eureka Street crossings. The change was made after it was reportedly discovered that the system was not working as intended during testing.
Metrolink says that they cannot comment on pending litigation.

It was the second fatal train-vs.-pedestrian collision in that area in less than two weeks.
The fatality prompted the closure of the rail lines during the morning commute, and Metrolink was arranging alternate bus transportation for passengers stranded by the closure.
The death is being investigated Wednesday by Detective Roger Parge of the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department’s Homicide Bureau, who collected video evidence of the collision from the train, as well as statements from the train’s engineering staff as the train remained stopped on the tracks in Canyon Country.
At the site of the collision, as detectives investigated the incident, a scene of grief played out just as it had last week at the same intersection, when an extremely distraught woman at the scene identified herself as the mother of the 21-year-old man killed when he was struck by a train in the evening on Labor Day.
On Wednesday morning, a woman sat crying on the sidewalk near the scene of the collision. She was being consoled by her friend Luis Hernandez, who said the man who was killed was her boyfriend.
Local resident Naomi Stenson stopped on Soledad Canyon Road, held her hands toward the group of grieving friends and family and said a prayer for them Wednesday morning before continuing on her morning commute near the bike path on the major street.
Throughout the morning, the Metrolink Antelope Valley Line account on X, formerly known as Twitter, provided updates for passengers who take the commuter train from stations in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys.
As of 10 a.m., the tracks remained closed and Train No. 212 was being held at the Via Princessa Station. The tracks reopened shortly after 11:30 a.m. and commuter train service resumed, with speed restrictions in the area near the collision scene.
The @MetrolinkAV account advised passengers to visit metrolinktrains.com/ubervouchers and metrolinktrains.com/qsp for information on how to receive reimbursement or Uber vouchers for alternate transportation.
The coroner’s office had not yet released the identity of the person killed as of Wednesday afternoon, pending the notification of his next-of-kin.

Two were deadly. One of those deadly accidents occurred Sunday afternoon at the Washington Street train station.
Tom Sayer says he’s been working near this train stop for 25 years.
""There's always danger. There's going to be danger no matter what. I don't know how you make it safer."" Tom says, bicyclists and pedestrians must be cautious. ""Trains slow down and they go really slow through here. That's been the case for a long time. I think everyone has got to be careful.""
It's not just Washington Street. There was another deadly train accident on Monday where a woman was hit by another coaster train near Morena Boulevard and Asher Street in San Diego.
In Del Mar, a pedestrian was seriously hurt when they were also hit by a coaster train near Via De La Valle and Camino Del Mar.
All of the accidents happened within a 36-hour window.
Tom says the crossings where he works seem safe enough.
""It seems like the people that are unsafe here are unsafe because they're not taking care of their own safety."" Tom adds, ""all those measures and the red lights are flashing? It's pretty clear that the train is coming if you're paying attention.""
Robin says, she was neighbors with the victim who died Sunday afternoon.
""I just know he rode his bike all the time. He's missed,” Robin offered. ""I saw him 'Good morning' every morning. He was an older gentleman, kind of stayed to himself.""
Robin says, train safety is important to remember. ""I think it's safe because they're loud enough. I can hear them coming. If he didn't honk his horn, maybe. I'd never have headphones on in this area. That would be dangerous. But you can feel the train coming because the tracks vibrate. So if you didn't hear it, you could still feel the vibration of the train.""
Luke says he's a bicyclist and there are things pedestrians and bike riders have to remember at train stops. ""You can hear the sirens, you can hear the gates coming up and down and you can hear the train from quite a distance. You do have to take personal responsibility for knowing where you are and foreign objects like trains, traffic and things like that so there is some personal responsibility that has to happen, I think.""
We reached out to the North County Transit District for comment on this story and they sent us the following statement:
“Unfortunately, over the Labor Day weekend the COASTER experienced three separate incidents of individuals who were trespassing in NCTD’s right of way being struck by a train. These are tragic events that not only impact families and communities, but also the mental health of railroad employees, passengers, first responders, and others.
The importance of being aware of your surroundings when you are near the rail line cannot be overstated. Trains are bigger, faster, and quieter than you think. We urge the public to stay clear of the rail line, cross only at designated areas, and always expect a train to come when you see the tracks.”
What to do when at a railroad crossing
One train accident is an accident too many. Here are some quick tips to remember when you're at a railroad crossing:
- Use common sense
- Look both ways.
- Listen for the train.
- Make sure there’s room for you and or your vehicle on the other side of the crossing.
- And pay attention to all of the signs, markers and don't underestimate those flashing lights, or the train's speed. Here are additional tips from the Federal Railroad Administration.
Background information

Maseeh Muhammad was identified by the L.A. County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office to have been fatally struck near the intersection of Golden Triangle Road and Ruether Avenue.
Muhammad, a Santa Clarita resident, was 21 years old at the time of his death, 25 days away from his 22nd birthday.
The collision occurred at approximately 6:30 p.m. Passengers and crew of the train were either interviewed by sheriff’s deputies or escorted off the train — which was approximately 700 feet from where the collision took place.
Lt. Richard O’Neil, watch commander for the SCV Sheriff’s Station, said the collision does not appear to be a suicide, but rather appears to be an accident.
At the scene of the incident on Monday night, a woman and man waited while deputies investigated. The woman, extremely distraught, believed the victim was her son who had been out walking a dog. The victim’s identity had yet to be officially confirmed at the time.
Metrolink lines were delayed on the Antelope Valley line well into the evening.

Published Sept. 14 2023, 11:22 a.m. ET
The Gist:
- Paige Gallagher is in mourning over the death of her boyfriend Conor Vislay.
- She announced his death online and posted a video on TikTok of her getting ready for his funeral and acknowledged that she was still in mourning.
- Conor died after he got hit by a Metrolink train in California.
Dealing with loss is a completely individual experience, and people react to it in a variety of different ways. Paige Gallagher, a popular TikTok comedian, announced in late August that her boyfriend Conor Vislay had died. On Sept. 13, 2023, she posted a ""get ready with me"" video for his funeral.
Paige acknowledged that the idea behind the video was crazy, but also said that no one should judge her because of the grief she was going through. Paige's video and post have led many to want to learn more about Conor and about the circumstances around his death.
Paige Gallagher posted about her boyfriend's death on Instagram and TikTok.
In late August, Paige posted a tribute to Conor alongside pictures of the two of them together.
""Sweet, sweet Conor. I’m the luckiest girl in the world to have known you,"" she wrote. ""This is the hardest thing I’ve ever posted and I’m struggling to find the words. You made me feel like I could do anything. It was like a superpower of yours; making people feel unstoppable.""
""The joy you radiated was unmatched and I’m forever grateful to have experienced you,"" she added. ""You’re the best person I’ve ever known. My best friend, my soulmate, the love of my life.Thank you.I love you, I miss you, I love you. Rest easy.""
In her TikTok video, Paige said that she was currently going through the anger stage of her grief, and that nothing around her actually felt real.
She seemed to be angry both at Conor for leaving her, and said that she also had a short temper with everyone at the moment. She also said that she doesn't know why she's making the video. ""I just felt like it,"" she adds.
In the comments under both the post and the video, she received plenty of support from folks who understood that grief can manifest in strange ways, and offered her condolences for her loss.
Conor apparently died in a train accident.
Conor and Paige both live in La Verne, Calif., and reports suggest that Conor died after an accident involving Metrolink commuter train at Ruether Avenue and Golden Triangle Road intersection. Conor was reportedly hit by the train and immediately succumbed to his injuries as a result. Conor was just 24 years old. It's unclear whether Conor stepped in front of the train intentionally or if he was hit by accident.
Paige and everyone else who loved Conor are left grieving his loss. Paige hasn't made any announcement about when she might resume regular posting.

More About Pedestrian Accident Liability
Pedestrians usually get major injuries in pedestrian accidents. Sometimes, they can even cause death. When it comes to liability, it can fall on the pedestrian or driver based on various factors of the accident. Proving liability can become vague or obvious. The process generally involves finding out who acted carelessly, causing the accident. Any Los Angeles personal injury or accident lawyer will tell you that you need to show the following to prove negligence and liability:
- legal responsibility or “duty of care”
- violated or breached the duty of care
- the violation caused the accident
- the violation resulted in injuries or damages
In some cases, the driver might’ve sped down the road, hitting the pedestrian. This can put fault on the driver. Meanwhile, pedestrians can get hit by a car because they acted against traffic signals, such as jaywalking. In these instances, the pedestrian can become at fault. Other factors, such as lack of road markings and ample lighting, can also lead to pedestrian accidents. In these cases, a pedestrian accident lawyer can help look at all angles to determine liability. Learn more about pedestrian accident lawyers in California here.

The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that the 45-degree angle where the road crossed the tracks made it hard for the dump truck driver to see the approaching train, and the steep approach discouraged the truck driver from stopping beforehand.
""The safest rail grade crossing is no rail grade crossing. But at the very least, every road-rail intersection should have an adequate design to ensure proper visibility so drivers can see oncoming trains,"" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said. ""Communities across the country deserve safer crossings so these types of accidents don't happen again.""
The NTSB said the dump truck driver didn't stop before continuing through the crossing at a speed of about 5 mph. The train was travelling 87 mph (140 kph) — close to the 90 mph speed limit for the area in western Missouri — at the time of the collision.
The NTSB has previously said investigators didn't find any problems with the train's brakes or other mechanical issues.
The crossing near Mendon where the collision happened didn't have any lights or signals to warn that a train was approaching. Before the crash, area residents had expressed concerns for nearly three years about the safety of the crossing because of the lack of visibility. Another dump truck driver who witnessed the crash told investigators that he didn't typically stop at the crossing either because the steep grade of the gravel road entering the crossing made it hard to start up again.
The state Transportation Department had put the $400,000 project to add lights and gates at the crossing on a priority list, but it hadn't received funding before the derailment.
The Mendon crossing was closed immediately after last year's crash. State officials will announce a $50 million plan to upgrade rail crossings statewide along tracks that passenger railroads use Thursday. Those projects will focus on the 47 passive crossings on three tracks that carry passenger trains although the NTSB said last year that Missouri has about 3,500 crossings like that statewide.
Roughly half of all rail crossings nationwide — some 130,000 of them — are considered passive without any lights or arms that automatically come down when a train is approaching.
For years, the NTSB has recommended closing passive crossings or adding gates, bells and other safety measures whenever possible. The U.S. Transportation Department recently announced $570 million in grants to help eliminate railroad crossings in 32 states but that funding will only eliminate a few dozen crossings.
Federal statistics show that roughly 2,000 collisions occur every year at rail crossings nationwide, and last year nearly 250 deaths were recorded in car-train crashes.
The people killed in the Amtrak derailment included the dump truck driver, 54-year-old Billy Barton II, of Brookfield, Missouri, and three passengers: Rochelle Cook, 58, and Kim Holsapple, 56, both of DeSoto, Kansas, and 82-year-old Binh Phan, of Kansas City, Missouri.
The Missouri State Highway Patrol said up to 150 people also were injured.
The Southwest Chief was traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago when it hit the rear right side of the truck near Mendon. Two locomotives and eight cars derailed. The train had 12 crewmembers and 271 aboard.
Several lawsuits were filed against BNSF after the derailment because that Fort Worth, Texas-based freight railroad owns and maintains the tracks involved.
Amtrak and BNSF estimated that the derailment caused roughly $4 million damage to their equipment and tracks.

The Hazara Express train travelling from Karachi to Rawalpindi derailed in Nawabshah district near the Sarhari Railway Station, 275 kilometres from the provincial capital Karachi.
Railways Minister Saad Rafiq told the media that 30 people died and 80 others were injured in the accident.
The minister said the top priority for Railway authorities was to complete the rescue and clearance operations. He said an inquiry would be conducted to find out the cause of the accident.
Commissioner Benazirabad division Abbas Baloch also said that 30 people died in the accident while some passengers are still trapped in a bogie.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, who spoke to the media at People’s Medical College Hospital in Benazirabad - the district home to Nawabshah, confirmed the death toll.
He added that the injured could be shifted to Karachi if needed and directed the local administration and health officials to expedite relief and rescue efforts.
He said around 1,000 passengers were travelling in the Hazara Express.
The driver of the Hazara Express told Geo News that the speed of the train was around 50 kilometres per hour when 10 out of 19 compartments went off the track one after the another.
“The maximum speed limit on the line is 105 KM per hour so we were well within the speed limit. I have no idea what happened,” he said.
Pakistan Railways Sukkur Divisional Commercial Officer (DCO) Mohsin Siyal said 15 bodies were retrieved from the wreckage and the rescue work aided by the Pakistan Army was continuing.
Television channels showed the crash site with train compartments badly damaged near the station. They showed rescue workers and police trying to pull out people from the derailed compartments along with civilians who also joined the rescue work.
“Right now, the focus is on rescue work and recovering people from the derailed compartments,” an official said.
He said that the cause of the accident is being investigated.
The state-run Radio Pakistan reported that the Pakistan Army and Rangers were involved in relief and rescue activities at the accident site.
The rescue operation has been started on the special directives of Army chief General Asim Munir, it added.
Additional troops have been called in to assist the rescue operation. The Army Aviation helicopters are also reaching the spot to rescue the injured people.
“The rescue operation of Pakistan Army will continue till the transfer of the last injured to the hospital and the rehabilitation of the people trapped at the accident site,” it said.
A spokesperson of the Pakistan Railways in Karachi earlier said at least eight bogies derailed and the intensity of the accident increased due to delayed application of brakes.
The official said the affected bogies would be lifted off the track in a few hours using heavy machines and added that trains departing from Karachi might face delays.
Railways Minister Rafiq said the train, carrying over 1,000 passengers, was travelling at a reasonable speed, which initial investigations showed, He said an emergency has been imposed in hospitals in Sukkur and Nawabshah.
Shaheed Benzirabad Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Muhammad Younis Chandio termed the incident a “big accident”. However, the official refrained from confirming the number of casualties.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, whose Pakistan Peoples’ Party is in power in the province, directed the Sindh government to provide immediate treatment to the passengers injured in the train accident and also called on PPP workers to participate in relief and rescue activities.
Railways accidents occur frequently in Pakistan due to outdated track maintenance systems, signal issues, technical equipment and old engines. Pakistan’s Railway system covers around 7,500 kilometres.
Sindh has seen the worst railway accidents with the worst train disaster taking place in 1990 near Sukkur when 307 people were killed.
Sunday’s accident came just a day after three coaches of Allama Iqbal Express - travelling from Karachi to Sialkot - derailed, but no one suffered injuries.
In April, seven people were killed when a fire broke out in a bogie of the Karachi Express travelling from Karachi to Lahore near Tando Masti Khan in the Khairpur district of the southern Sindh province.
On June 7, 2021, 32 people were killed and 64 injured after two express trains collided in Sindh’s Ghotki.
In February 2020, 19 people were killed when a train collided with a passenger bus near Sindh’s Rohri station.

- Share via
TEMPE, Greece — Rescuers searched late into the night Wednesday for survivors amid the burned-out wreckage of two trains that collided in northern Greece, killing at least 43 people and crumpling carriages into twisted steel knots in the country’s deadliest rail crash.
The impact just before midnight Tuesday threw some passengers into ceilings and out the windows.
“My head hit the roof of the carriage with the jolt,” Stefanos Gogakos, who was in a rear car, told state broadcaster ERT. He said windows shattered, showering riders with glass.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called the collision of the passenger train and a freight train “a horrific rail accident without precedent in our country,” and pledged a full, independent investigation.
He said it appears the crash was “mainly due to a tragic human error” but did not elaborate.
The train from Athens to Thessaloniki was carrying 350 passengers, many of them students returning from raucous Carnival celebrations. Although the track is double, the trains were traveling in opposite directions on the same line near the Vale of Tempe, a river valley about 235 miles north of Athens.
Authorities arrested the stationmaster at the train’s last stop, in the city of Larissa. They did not release the man’s name or the reason for the arrest, but the stationmaster is responsible for rail traffic on that stretch of the tracks. He was due to appear before a prosecutor Thursday to be formally charged.
After last month’s fiery freight train crash in Ohio, the state’s two senators, a Democrat and a Republican, are proposing new federal safety regulations for railroad companies.
Transportation Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned, saying he felt it was his duty to step down “as a basic indication of respect for the memory of the people who died so unfairly.”
Karamanlis said he had made “every effort” to improve a railway system that had been “in a state that doesn’t befit the 21st century.”
But, he added, “When something this tragic happens it’s impossible to continue as if nothing has happened.”
The union representing train workers announced a 24-hour strike for Thursday, while protests by left-wing groups broke out in Athens late Wednesday. Athens metro workers also called a 24-hour strike for Thursday, saying they face similar problems as railway employees.
The crew of a train that derailed in Ohio received a warning about an overheated axle only just before the cars went off the tracks, the NTSB says.
Emergency workers used cranes and other heavy machinery to move large pieces of the trains, revealing more bodies and dismembered remains. The operation was to continue overnight, with firefighters proceeding painstakingly through the wreckage.
“It’s unlikely there will be survivors, but hope dies last,” rescuer Nikos Zygouris said.
Larissa’s chief coroner, Roubini Leondari, said so far 43 bodies had been brought to her for examination, and would require DNA identification as they were largely disfigured.
“Most [of the bodies] are young people,” she told ERT. “They are in very bad condition.”
A 2008 train crash in Chatsworth killed 25 people and broke a long congressional stalemate on a nationwide rail safety project known as “positive train control.” Twelve years later, that system is finally in place.
Greece’s firefighting service said 57 people remained hospitalized late Wednesday, including six in intensive care. More than 15 others were discharged after receiving initial treatment.
More than 200 people who were unharmed in the crash or suffered minor injuries were taken by bus to Thessaloniki, 80 miles north. Police took their names as they arrived in an effort to track anyone who may be missing.

Hellenic Train, which operates all of Greece’s passenger and cargo trains, including those that collided, offered its “heartfelt condolences” to the victims’ families. The company belongs to Italy’s state railways.
Eight rail employees were among those killed in the crash, including the two drivers of the freight train and the two drivers of the passenger train, according to Greek Railroad Workers Union President Yannis Nitsas.
The union called the one-day strike to protest what it said was chronic neglect of Greece’s railways by successive governments.
“Unfortunately, our long-standing demands for staff hirings, better training and above all use of modern safety technology always end up in the wastepaper basket,” it said in a statement.
A teenage survivor who did not give his name to reporters said that just before the crash he felt a powerful braking and saw sparks — and then there was a sudden stop.
“Our carriage didn’t derail, but the ones in front did and were smashed,” he said, visibly shaken. He used a bag to break the window of his car, the fourth, and escape.
Among the bitter lessons that Ukrainians have had to learn in the nearly nine months since Russia invaded is that what’s here today can be destroyed tomorrow and that nothing in war can be taken for granted.
Gogakos said the crash felt like an explosion, and some smoke entered the carriage. He said some passengers escaped through windows but that after a few minutes, crew members were able to open the doors and let people out.
Multiple cars derailed and at least one burst into flames.
“Temperatures reached 1,300 degrees Celsius [2,372 Fahrenheit], which makes it even more difficult to identify the people who were in it,” fire service spokesperson Vassilis Varthakoyiannis said.
A man who was trying to find his daughter, who was on the train, described a harrowing phone conversation with her before she was cut off.
“She told me ‘we’re on fire. ... My hair is burning,’” he told ERT, without giving his name.
Many of the passengers were students returning to Thessaloniki from Carnival, but officials said but no detailed passenger list was available. This year was the first time the festival, which precedes Lent, was celebrated in full since the start of the pandemic in 2020.
The government declared three days of national mourning from Wednesday, while flags flew at half-staff outside all European Commission buildings in Brussels.
Visiting the accident scene, Prime Minister Mitsotakis said the government must help the injured recover and identify the dead.
“I can guarantee one thing: We will find out the causes of this tragedy and we will do all that’s in our power so that something like this never happens again,” Mitsotakis said.
It was the country’s deadliest rail crash on record. In 1968, 34 people died in a crash in the Peloponnese region in the south.
Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou broke off an official visit to Moldova to visit the scene, laying flowers beside the wreckage.
Pope Francis offered his condolences to the families of the dead in a message sent to the president of the Greek bishops conference on his behalf by the Vatican’s secretary of state.
The devastating quakes killed at least 50,000 people with many more injured, tens of thousands still missing and hundreds of thousands homeless.
Condolences poured in from all over the world, including neighboring Turkey, Greece’s historic regional rival. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed his sorrow and his wishes for a speedy recovery for those injured, a statement from his office said.
Despite the frosty relations between the two NATO nations, Greece’s leadership had called Erdogan last month following a massive earthquake that killed tens of thousands in Turkey last month.
In Athens, several hundred members of left-wing groups marched late Wednesday to protest the train deaths. Minor clashes broke out as some protesters threw stones at the offices of Greece’s rail operator and riot police, and set dumpsters on fire. No arrests or injuries were reported.

BNSF owns the railroad tracks used by Amtrak when a Southwest Chief train traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago collided with a pickup truck that was blocking an intersection near Mendon, Missouri. Three train passengers and the truck driver died and dozens more were injured in the June 27 collision.
Multiple lawsuits have been filed since the collision against both railway companies. Missouri transportation officials, Chariton County leaders and areas residents had been pushing for safety upgrades at the crossing, which is steep and had no lights or other signals to warn about an approaching train.
In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday, BNSF asked for a preliminary injunction to require the victims to use arbitration rather than proceed with their lawsuits in court. The company also asked the judge to halt action on lawsuits pending in Missouri courts until the arbitration question is settled.
BNSF, based in Fort Worth, Texas, argues that when passengers bought tickets from Amtrak, they checked a box agreeing to terms and conditions, which includes binding arbitration agreements. BNSF argues the terms apply to the company because it is the host railroad for Amtrak.
Grant Davis, who was appointed as a lead attorney for a plaintiff’s committee working to consolidate pre-trial matters in the numerous lawsuits, said BNSF is trying to take away his clients’ constitutional right to a jury trial.
“We believe they are wrong factually and legally on this issue,” Davis said. “The fact that BNSF was not a party to (Amtrak’s) poor attempt at an arbitration agreement is fatal to this effort. It’s adding insult to injury for BNSF to file a case against the very people it injured.”
Among the defendants named in the lawsuit are relatives of the three passengers who died: Rochelle Cook, 58, and Kim Holsapple, 56, both of De Soto, Kansas; and Binh Pham, 82, of Kansas City, Missouri.",Amtrak,BNSF Railway Co.,Amtrak,Unknown,"June 27, 2021",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Chariton County,MO,Unknown,Unknown,D,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,8,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Grant Davis, Lead Attorney",Signature: Unknown,Date: Unknown

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - BNSF Railway filed a lawsuit this week against victims and surviving family members of the summer’s deadly Amtrak train derailment in Mendon, MO, saying Terms And Conditions of buying the ticket included language barring them from suing the railroad.
Victims and surviving family members of the June 27 crash that killed four people and injured 150 others have been suing BNSF over the incident in recent months, since the railway owns and operates the tracks that particular Amtrak train used to travel the trip between Los Angeles and Chicago. National Transportation Safety Board investigators had determined that the crossing where the crash occurred did not have safety mechanisms in place---including crossing arms, bells or lights. The train derailed after colliding with a dump truck at the crossing.
The lawsuits filed by the victims and surviving family members claim BNSF had been previously warned about safety issues on such crossings.
In a lawsuit filed in federal court Tuesday in Missouri, BNSF claims victims and their families cannot seek financial compensation through the courts, because passengers on the train all had to check boxes on lengthy Terms And Conditions in order to buy a ticket. Those check-boxes included language stating that any disputes passengers may have with the railroad must be arbitrated directly with the company and not through the court system, the lawsuit claims.
The crash site is less than two hours northeast of the Kansas City area, and a Kansas City attorney---Sean Hamer of Scharnhorst Ast Kennard Griffin PC law firm---is representing BNSF in the lawsuit. Another Kansas City attorney---Grant Davis of Davis, Bethune & Jones---is representing dozens of plaintiffs who are suing the railroad. Many of the passengers in the crash were from the Kansas City area, and three of the people who died were local---Rochelle Cook, 58, of De Soto, KS, Kim Holsapple, 56, of De Soto, and Binh Pham, 82, of Kansas City, MO.
There is no next court date listed yet for the case.

Two Union Pacific operators were killed early Thursday when their train crashed into parked freight cars near the Salton Sea, officials said.
The freight train had been traveling through a desolate stretch of desert next to Highway 111, which runs along the eastern coast of the Salton Sea. Around 3 a.m., the train pulled off the main railroad and onto a siding, said Susan Stevens, a spokesperson for Union Pacific.
As the train pulled onto the siding — an alternate railway typically used for trains to pull over to allow oncoming traffic to go by — it hit several parked rail cars, derailing the engine and seven of its cars, Stevens said.
Both operators, who had been ejected from the train, were declared dead at the crash scene.
First responders with the city of Calipatria said they arrived to find the derailed locomotive and the wreckage of the four parked rail cars it had plowed through.
Most of the tall shipping containers that the train was hauling remained intact.
Houston-based Amplify Energy Corp. and two subsidiaries were charged with misdemeanor counts of pollution and failing to immediately report last fall’s discharge of oil.
An Amtrak passenger train arrived in the area a few minutes after the crash, but it was able to slow to a halt.
“It definitely could’ve been worse,” one Calipatria firefighter said.
The Imperial County coroner’s office identified the two workers only as adult males, as officials worked to notify their next of kin. The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to investigate the crash.
Investigators were still determining what prompted the train’s operators to head onto the siding before the crash and why the rail cars were parked there.
The siding is near where the tracks intersect with Range Road, which cuts off from the highway and connects to several private, residential properties. It was not clear whether the crossing played a factor in the collision.
PG&E on Thursday disclosed ‘electrical activity’ near where the Mosquito fire started in the foothills east of Sacramento. The blaze made a run later that afternoon.
After an Amtrak train collided with a dump truck in Missouri in June, killing four people and injuring more than 150 others, federal transportation officials faced calls to improve safety around railway crossings.
The Missouri crossing lacked lights and gates, which prompted federal investigators to call the incident preventable. Upgrades were scheduled at the crossing but had not yet begun, despite complaints from local farmers.
NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said about 50% of the nation’s 130,000 railway crossings are considered “passive,” meaning they don’t have lights, bells or gates.
Incidents involving highway and railroad crossings make up about a quarter of all train incidents and about 30% of all train-related fatalities, according to Federal Railroad Administration statistics.
The majority of the 1,381 train-related deaths from 2019 to June 2022 involved people trespassing onto railroad tracks. In that same span, 13 railway employees have died in train accidents.

A man was dragged to his death after his clothing and foot got caught in the door of a subway car while he was trying to get off the train in Brooklyn late Wednesday night, authorities said. The New York resident, believed to be in his 30s, died after he became caught between train doors that closed and did not reopen when the train started moving again, police said.
The accident occurred at the Avenue M stop in Brooklyn's Marine Park neighborhood, according to CBS New York. He was riding the Q train.
The New York City Police Department is currently investigating the incident, but officials who spoke with local reporters said the man was dragged along train tracks as the subway proceeded on to its next destination.
Personnel at the New York City Transit Authority said on Twitter early Thursday morning that northbound Q trains were experiencing delays ""while emergency teams respond to a person who was struck by a train at Avenue M.""

Fatal Train Accident Statistics
In some cases, it’s not the most efficient or cost-effective way to get around the city. Travel-related fatalities and injuries are on the rise.
Accidents involving trains frequently occur across the country. Train-car accidents occur in the United States at a rate of approximately 5,800 per year. The majority of the time, you’ll see them at railroad crossings. These accidents resulted in the deaths of 600 people and the injury of 2,300 others.
Most railroad crossings are not properly equipped with adequate warning devices, as stated by the Federal Railroad Administration of the USDOT.
The majority of train accidents are caused by derailments, poorly maintained tracks, a lack of adherence to safety regulations, inadequate security, and other carelessness.

In April 2022, a meme circulated on social media describing the effects of a train collision, along with text stating the cause of the crash. We will include a screenshot of one version of the meme posted to Twitter, with the Twitter user's name cropped out for privacy:
The tweet above refers to a real incident, although it didn't happen in downtown Los Angeles. It happened in Glendale, a city roughly 10 miles north of downtown L.A.
The crash occurred on Jan. 26, 2005, just after 6 a.m. when a Metrolink commuter train headed south smashed into an SUV parked on the tracks, killing 11 people. As the Los Angeles Times reported, the train jackknifed. Aside from the fatalities, nearly 200 people were injured.
The meme is accurate in that the cause of the crash was a man who parked his car on the tracks, and later told investigators he planned to commit suicide, but changed his mind at the last minute, abandoning the vehicle. The man, Juan Manuel Alvarez, was indeed sentenced to 11 consecutive life sentences, as the meme states.
The 2005 crash was the second deadliest in Metrolink's history, surpassed in 2008 by a collision between a commuter train and a freight train in Chatsworth, a San Fernando Valley neighborhood in northwest Los Angeles. In that crash, 25 people died when the westbound train they were riding in collided head-on with an eastbound freight train.
The cause of the Chatsworth crash was determined to be a distracted Metrolink engineer, who was texting and failed to see a red danger signal alerting him to the oncoming train.",Metrolink,"Union Pacific Railroad (Assumed, as it's the common other entity in such incidents)","Southern California Regional Rail Authority (Assumed, as it's responsible for Metrolink's operations)",Unknown,2005-01-26,6:00 AM,Unknown,Unknown,Los Angeles County,CA,Unknown,Unknown,J,Unknown,Unknown,1,C,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,9,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,'Unknown','Unknown','Unknown','Unknown',Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Nearly 20 years ago, a young man lost his life at the at attraction in California, which led the state to mandate stricter safety requirements. And today, some still believe his spirit lives on inside the park.
Twenty-two-year-old , a graphic designer and aspiring animator, was seated in the lead passenger car of the vehicle at Disneyland’s attraction when a tragic accident happened on the ride in 2003. The crash was the result of the failure of a mechanical part on the locomotive vehicle.
Per a report in the Times, the happened when two bolts from the locomotive’s left guide wheel assembly came loose and fell off the vehicle, causing a chain-reaction of events.
The bolts falling off caused “an axle to jam into the railroad’s ties. The locomotive nose-dived, and its rear hit the top of a tunnel. The force snapped a tow bar connecting the locomotive to the lead passenger car, which slammed into the locomotive’s undercarriage,” according to the Times.

After the crash, the state ordered Disneyland to retrain maintenance workers, managers, and operators; to require a test run of all cars on before passengers are loaded, and to require that those who perform maintenance on rides be the ones who sign that the work was completed.
The crash was one of three major accidents during a five-year period at Disneyland in which maintenance arose as an issue.

A quiet central Iowa morning turned deadly when a passenger train, loaded with riders, derailed. It happened more than a century ago.
On the morning of Monday, March 21, 1910, an earlier train derailment forced passenger trains from the Rock Island Railroad to detour off their usual route. KWWL reports they were utilizing Chicago and Northwestern tracks through Marshalltown, Iowa. It was just miles from Marshalltown that disaster struck.
Two trains that were supposed to leave Cedar Rapids between 12:30 and 1 a.m. were combined into one and sent off for Marshalltown after being delayed by the derailment earlier in the day. After stopping in Marshalltown, the train embarked for Waterloo.
According to KWWL, the train's conductor repositioned the two locomotives of the train ""at a Y connection facing south, pulling the passenger cars north."" The location of the passenger cars, which were typically kept at the back of the train for safety, were changed during the repositioning. It put them between a pair of locomotives and other steel cars.
When both locomotives derailed around 8:15 a.m., the wooden passenger cars were crushed by a steel engine and other steel train cars. The accident happened approximately four miles to the north of Green Mountain, not far from Gladbrook, in central Iowa.
The scope of the disaster was unthinkable. A total of three cars were destroyed with most of the people killed riding in a ""chair car."" A total of 52 people lost their lives in the accident, 39 of them from Iowa according to the report of those that were killed. Thirty-nine more were injured.
Though both speed and excess weight were suspected as the reasons for the derailment, its official cause was never determined. Changes in procedures involving railroad safety would result from the derailment, which remains the deadliest train accident in Iowa history.

They also indicated that the crew of the train was safe, and an investigation into the cause of the derailment was underway.
The University of Southern California was the first to report the incident, though entirely unrelated to the university, the derailed train is near the Health Science Campus, prompting the school to report the occurrence.

JOPLIN, Mont. — At least three people were killed Saturday afternoon when an Amtrak train that runs between Seattle and Chicago derailed in north-central Montana, toppling several cars onto their sides, authorities said.
The westbound Empire Builder train derailed about 4 p.m. near Joplin, a town of about 200, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said in a statement. The accident scene is about 150 miles (241 kilometers) northeast of Helena and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border with Canada.
Liberty County sheriff's dispatcher Starr Tyler told The Associated Press that three people died in the derailment. She did not have more details. Amtrak confirmed the deaths and said there were multiple injuries.
""We are deeply saddened to learn local authorities are now confirming that three people have lost their lives as a result of this accident,"" Abrams said.
The train had about 141 passengers and 16 crew members onboard, Abrams said. The train had two locomotives and 10 cars, eight of which derailed, he said.
""We are deeply saddened to learn local authorities are now confirming that three people have lost their lives as a result of this accident,"" Abrams said.
Megan Vandervest, a passenger who was going to visit a friend in Seattle, told The New York Times that she was awakened by the derailment.
""My first thought was that we were derailing because, to be honest, I have anxiety and I had heard stories about trains derailing,"" said Vandervest, who is from Minneapolis. ""My second thought was that's crazy. We wouldn't be derailing. Like, that doesn't happen.""
She told the Times that the car behind hers was tilted, the one behind that was tipped over, and the three cars behind that ""had completely fallen off the tracks and were detached from the train.""
Speaking from the Liberty County Senior Center, where some passengers were being taken, Vandervest said it felt like ""extreme turbulence on a plane.""
Residents of communities near the crash site quickly mobilized to help the passengers.
Chester Councilwoman Rachel Ghekiere said she and others helped about 50 to 60 passengers who were brought to a local school.
""I went to the school and assisted with water, food, wiping dirt off faces,"" she said. ""They appeared to be tired, shaken but happy that they were where they were. Some looked more disheveled than others, depending where they were on the train.""
A grocery store in Chester, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the derailment, and a nearby religious community provided food, she said.
The passengers were taken by buses to hotels in nearby Shelby, said Ghekiere, whose husband works for the local emergency services agency and was alerted to the crash.
The National Transportation Safety Board will send a 14-member team, including investigators and specialists in railroad signals and other disciplines, to investigate the crash, spokesman Eric Weiss said.
Weiss said the derailment occurred around 3:55 p.m. and no other trains or equipment were involved. The train was traveling on a BNSF Railway main track at the time, he said.
Photos posted to social media showed rail cars on their sides and passengers standing alongside the tracks, some carrying luggage. The images showed sunny skies, and it appeared the accident occurred along a straight section of tracks.
Amtrak said that because of the derailment, the Sunday westbound Empire Builder will terminate in Minneapolis, and the Sunday eastbound Empire Builder train will originate in Minneapolis.
Allan Zarembski, director of the University of Delaware's Railway Engineering and Safety Program, said he didn't want to speculate but suspected the derailment stemmed from an issue with the train track or equipment, or a combination of both.
Railways have ""virtually eliminated"" major derailments by human error after the implementation of positive train control nationwide, Zarembski said.
""I would be surprised if this was a human-factor derailment,"" Zarembski said.
Depending on how complex the cause of the derailment was, NTSB findings may take months, he added, as investigators must interview witnesses and sift through the pile-up and damage to collect evidence and then send samples off for further testing.
Other recent Amtrak derailments include:
— April 3, 2016: Two maintenance workers were struck and killed by an Amtrak train going more than 100 mph in Chester, Pennsylvania. The lead engine of the train derailed.
— March 14, 2016: An Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago derailed in southwest Kansas, sending five cars off the tracks and injuring at least 32 people. Investigators concluded that a cattle feed delivery truck hit the track and shifted it at least a foot before the derailment.
— Oct. 5, 2015: A passenger train headed from Vermont to Washington, D.C., derailed when it hit rocks that had fallen onto the track from a ledge. The locomotive and a passenger car spilled down an embankment, derailing three other cars and injuring seven people.

A blue Ford Taurus soon pulled up, and Trinity, 12, flew out of the house, forgetting to say goodbye.
“They’re here!” was all she hollered to her mother before hopping in the back seat with twins Brandon and Chase Day, and another friend from school, Jayla Daigle.
The group was headed to a trampoline park to celebrate the boys’ 12th birthday, chaperoned by the twins’ grandmother, Phyllis LeBlanc, 70, and her husband, Steven LeBlanc Jr. It was three days before Christmas 2015. Only one of them would live to see the new year.
As the Taurus drove off, the Sunset Limited was gliding through east Texas, nearing the end of its 1,900-mile journey from Los Angeles. The Amtrak train — two locomotives lugging seven passenger cars and 133 souls — was a million-pound chain of steel racing toward New Orleans, barreling through communities along the way.
Darkness had fallen and a menacing thunderstorm had erupted by the time the LeBlancs and the four kids left the trampoline park just before 5:30 p.m. Rain came down in sheets as Phyllis LeBlanc turned onto Highway 88, a rural, two-lane road in New Iberia. Brake lights glowed in the deluge as the vehicle in front of LeBlanc stopped at the intersection where Highway 88 meets Highway 182. She pulled up behind it, and a slight bump jostled her car.
Warning lights suddenly exploded all around the Taurus, flashing red. Two long mechanical arms descended in front of and behind the car. Then a train whistle screamed.
They were trapped on railroad tracks.
LeBlanc desperately tried to navigate an escape in the few seconds she had, witnesses told the Louisiana State Police. But the gates and other cars penned them in as the Sunset Limited roared toward the crossing at 70 mph.
It could not possibly stop in time.
The Amtrak annihilated the Ford, knocking it nearly 200 feet down the tracks. Phyllis LeBlanc, Trinity Schmidt and Jayla Daigle died in a sodden ditch beside the rails. The storm’s violence prevented the others from being airlifted to the hospital.
Chase Day died on Christmas Day, and Steven LeBlanc Jr. passed away Dec. 26.
Brandon Day was the only survivor.
“The doctor told us that Brandon had suffered some severe injuries, but that he was going to survive,” said Keith Day, the father of the twins. “Then they told us Chase was not. He had a massive, massive head injury. And he never even woke up.”
Fate, poor design and torrential rain might have conspired to put the Taurus on the tracks that night. But it was a cascade of failures, malfunctions and negligence that set the Sunset Limited on a collision course with a sedan filled with four kids, according to a lawsuit filed by the victims’ families.
The conditions that led to the fatal crash in New Iberia — simply getting caught in traffic at a stop sign or traffic light — exist at tens of thousands of railroad crossings in the U.S., including hundreds in New Jersey. They put drivers in potentially fatal situations with alarming regularity.
At the same time, deaths at railroad crossings have been increasing in recent years, up nearly 25% from 2015 to 2019, when almost 300 Americans were killed after decades of sharp declines.
A yearlong investigation by NJ Advance Media, supported by the O’Brien Fellowship at Marquette University, found safety failings have been evident for decades. Weak — and sometimes nonexistent — federal regulation has failed to rein in a mighty railroad industry that often blames rail crossing crashes on drivers.
Our investigation found that even relatively straightforward safety upgrades have been ignored at thousands of crossings, despite decades-old federal safety guidelines and clear evidence that the measures save lives. The New Iberia crossing is one of more than 40,000 across the country that doesn’t meet the standards, federal data shows. That number includes nearly one-third of all crossings in New Jersey.
The Federal Railroad Administration, the arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation that regulates railroads, lacks the funding, authority and political wherewithal to enforce these guidelines, giving railroads and state governments little incentive to effectuate them, according to industry experts.
Our investigation also found that the U.S. DOT’s top crossing safety program, which gives states millions of dollars every year to pay for upgrades, is dangerously flawed. The FRA has incorrect data for more than one-third of all railroad crossings in the country — and likely for many more. Officials use that data to determine what crossings receive safety improvements.
Meanwhile, even crossings with automatic gates and flashing lights — the most common safety devices — do not always protect drivers because the equipment fails regularly, violating federal regulations. Government officials have known the safety equipment is prone to malfunction since before it was widely adopted in the 1980s and ’90s.
“We’ve been getting people slaughtered,” said David Nelson, a former CSX railroad employee driven by safety concerns to become a government whistleblower. “They’re not fail-safe.”
Perhaps the most glaring outrage, though, is that the railroads get to control the narrative of all but the deadliest crashes. Federal officials investigate a minuscule percentage of collisions, almost always allowing railroads to examine their own accidents. In recent years, railroads have been caught lying as well as destroying and withholding evidence, according to court findings and whistleblowers.
“Those deaths will continue as long as the states and the FRA continue to regulate the railroads,” said Harvey Levine, a former official in the powerful railroad lobby The Association of American Railroads, who has since become an outspoken advocate for rail safety.
These horrific crashes come down to grim arithmetic, according to Levine.
“You’ve got 6,000 trains running a day and millions of cars,” he said. “Accidents are going to happen.”
But these tragedies transcend morbid probability for the shattered families.
Brandon and Chase Day chose not to ride home with their parents on that fateful day in 2015, insisting on staying with their friends in their grandmother’s car. So Keith and Jody Day drove to Phyllis LeBlanc’s house to wait for the birthday boys.
But only one ever made it back to them.
“It’s tore our family apart, and all it would have taken was for somebody to care,” Keith Day said in a recent interview. “It’s the cost of a life, and they don’t even care about the cost of a life.”
109 N.J. deaths
These crashes aren’t just some faraway problem, relegated to the rural corners of America. They occur regularly in New Jersey, too.
In November, a 17-year-old high school student was driving with a friend in Piscataway when they were hit by a freight train at the New Brunswick Avenue crossing. The passenger, a teenage girl whose name was not made public, was killed.
That crossing is one of at least 560 in New Jersey within 75 feet of an intersection, where traffic often backs up onto the tracks. Since 1975, those crossings have seen 687 crashes and 109 deaths, according to a database NJ Advance Media built for this investigation.
A stretch of track less than a mile long in Bergen County illustrates the lurking danger. The Midland Avenue crossing in Elmwood Park has been the scene of 34 crashes and two deaths since 1975. Only 22 rail crossings in the country have seen more crashes.
The next crossing south, on Market Street, has witnessed nine crashes and five deaths. Keep going south one more crossing and you’re again on Midland Avenue, this time in Garfield, where there have been 12 crashes and two deaths.
“There have been thousands and thousands of accidents that have been caused by cars being trapped on the crossing,” said Bob Comer, an Ohio-based railroad accident investigator. “In New York and New Jersey, which have a high concentration of people, so many of those crossings should have been eliminated so long ago.”
Trains and railroads are baked into American mythology. They evoke images of business titans and socialites lounging in the Pullman car, or vagabonds riding in boxcars. They have been the go-to toys for generations of American children and the setting for any number of classic books and movies, from “The General” to “Strangers on a Train” to “Unstoppable.”
The history and romance associated with railroads can obscure an important fact: They are massive businesses in this country, a literal engine driving American capitalism, responsible for hauling chemicals, coal and cars across the country.
The “Big Four” U.S. railroads — BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific — had a combined revenue in 2019 of nearly $70 billion, roughly the same as Facebook and Disney and more than Pepsi, financial documents show. BNSF and Union Pacific each made more money in 2019 than McDonald’s. The stock prices of CSX and Norfolk Southern have increased approximately 280% and 230%, respectively, over the past five years.
The “Big Four” aren’t shy about flexing political muscle, either. Since 2010, they have spent $177 million on lobbying and donated $57.7 million to political candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks political activity.
“The railroad is the most powerful entity in the United States, and they don’t want to identify hazards that are killing people,” said Bob Pottroff, a lawyer who regularly clashed with the railroads.
The railroads’ interest in minimizing liability dovetails with the government’s interest in sustaining an industry that supported $220 billion in economic output and 1.1 million jobs in 2017, according to a Towson University report. Those concerns appear to trump the safety of drivers at rail crossings despite obvious warning signs, Pottroff said.
Almost uniformly, the Big Four railroads and the Association of American Railroads said they follow federal guidelines and that the best way to protect drivers at crossings is to eliminate the crossings entirely.
The crash that killed Phyllis LeBlanc and four others is a prime example of how dangerous a crossing can be. To even an untrained eye, a Google Earth image of the intersection of highways 88 and 182 in New Iberia screams accident waiting to happen.
On Highway 88, drivers encounter train tracks and then — about 30 feet beyond them — an intersection where cars can turn only left or right. That space is big enough for just one car, which must stop. If traffic backs up at the intersection, it’s all too easy for a vehicle to end up stopped on the rails. In fact, the Google Street View of the crossing shows two trucks stopped directly on the tracks.
After the accident, I watched the crossing for about four hours over a two-day period. Nearly 50 cars came to a complete stop on the tracks while I sat in a rental car on a gravel patch next to the crossing. Since 1975, as far back as consistent government records go, 14 trains have hit cars there and eight people have died.
“You have to be supremely focused or really lucky to negotiate that crossing,” said Sarah Feinberg, head of the FRA under President Barack Obama.
Similar railroad crossings exist all over the country. More than a third of the 127,605 public crossings in the U.S. are within 75 feet of an intersection, according to the NJ Advance Media database built using government records. In New Jersey, those crossings comprise about 40% of the total.
And they are disproportionately perilous. Nearly 45% of the 18,152 deaths at active crossings since 1975 occurred within 75 feet of an intersection — as did almost half of the 162,266 crashes.
The federal government has recognized the danger of these crossings for more than 70 years. The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices — the bible of traffic signs and signals used by federal officials and state governments — has warned since at least 1948 just how hazardous these crossings can be.
The recommended fix isn’t complicated. Certainly, you don’t need to rip up roads or railways and start from scratch. Instead, federal guidelines call for crossings close to intersections to have safety equipment — automatic gates and flashing lights — that cooperates with an everyday traffic light. The industry calls this interconnection.
The system detects a train coming well before it arrives and signals to the equipment at the crossing and the intersection. That signal overrides the traffic light, which will quickly change to green, allowing cars on the crossing to clear the tracks. The light then switches to red ahead of the oncoming train.
The problem is the FRA says it cannot mandate interconnection at crossings — or any other safety equipment — leaving the decision to state and municipal authorities.
“A crossing that is interconnected with adjacent traffic signals is always safer than one without,” said Robert Halstead, a New York-based railroad accident investigator.
The New Iberia crossing not only lacks interconnection with a traffic light, but that intersection doesn’t even have a traffic signal.
It’s a problem nationwide. The NJ Advance Media database shows 93% of crossings within 75 feet of an intersection are not interconnected with traffic lights, as federal guidelines recommend. Even worse, nearly 40% do not have even basic safety devices, like flashing lights and automatic gates.
Eighty-three deaths have occurred at similar crossings in New Jersey that do not meet safety guidelines.
“These deaths are preventable,” said Feinberg, the former FRA administrator who is currently interim president of New York City Transit Authority. “There’s always more we can do.”
After the deadly crash last November at the New Brunswick Avenue crossing in Piscataway, authorities pinned the blame on the driver, as is common. They said the safety equipment was working properly at the time of the incident. But prosecutors went a step further and charged the driver, a minor, with vehicular homicide, aggravated manslaughter and driving without a license.
What the authorities didn’t say is the crossing does not follow federal guidelines.
There is no traffic signal. No interconnection. And no automatic gates. The Piscataway crossing is protected only by flashing lights. Even though nine crashes had previously happened there, additional safety equipment was not installed.
But prosecutors still blamed the 17-year-old driver.
A question of $
The issue largely comes down to money.
The U.S. DOT had a 2020 budget of nearly $87 billion. But only $2.8 billion of that — a smidge over 3% — went to the FRA in the last fiscal year. That’s about $100 million less than the previous year.
More safety equipment and increased oversight costs money, which the FRA can find hard to come by, said George Gavalla, a former FRA safety official.
“To get funding isn’t an easy thing,” he said. “There has to be a public backing for these types of things. One of the ways to get that public backing, unfortunately, is to have a major accident.”
In the 1960s, politicians began feeling the pressure of an ever-increasing death toll at rail crossings. (In 1965 alone, more than 1,500 people were killed at crossings, federal data shows.) Congressional leaders were dismayed to find that railroads largely regulated themselves, so lawmakers passed the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, which created the FRA to oversee railroads.
The law has proved successful: Since 1975, fatalities at crossings have dropped by 70%, according to federal data. Fatalities hit a low point in 2012, when 230 people were killed.
Gavalla, former head of safety for the FRA, said the reason for the decline was the removal or enhanced protection of thousands of dangerous crossings in the past few decades.
They got the “low-hanging fruit,” Gavalla said. “We reached a plateau, and the improvements aren’t quite as obvious.”
Deaths have been on the rise since 2012. The 294 people killed at crossings in 2019 were the most in 12 years. (Crossing accidents did fall 15% in 2020, but the National Safety Council reported the number of miles driven was down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Freight and passenger rail traffic was also down last year. Still, the accident rate at crossings continued to rise in 2020, FRA data shows.)
Yet the FRA’s ability to regulate railroads remains limited, in part because federal agencies have little power over individual states.
Congress forced railroads to update rail crossing data in 2008 as part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act. Railroads now are required to provide fresh information on how many trains run on the tracks, how fast they go and what safety equipment is in place.
Yet, there is no commensurate legislation to compel states to update their data, even though it is used to determine where safety equipment gets installed.
The result is a patchwork of shoddy data. In some cases, it’s plainly incorrect. In others, it’s badly outdated.
“The inventory is only as good as what’s submitted by our partners,” said Tammy Wagner, regional crossing specialist with the FRA. “I can tell you a lot of complaints about that. That’s a huge problem.”
How widespread is the problem? The FRA currently has incorrect data for more than one-third of all crossings in the country, according to an NJ Advance Media analysis of a random, representative sample.
“We can get after the railroads for their information. We can’t do that for the state’s information,” said Karl Alexy, the FRA’s chief safety officer. “Knowing we can go in and only count on half the data is frustrating.”
The data point most often incorrect is the distance crossings sit from nearby roads, according to the analysis. Many of the details about crossings, like how many cars cross the tracks every day, couldn’t be independently verified, so the true breadth of misreported data is likely higher.
And much of that crucial information is outdated to the point of being incorrect. Traffic counts at crossings are 17 years old on average in the federal data, while people are driving about 11% more every year than they were in 2004, according to U.S. Department of Energy statistics.
Even though critical safety decisions are ultimately made on the state level, the data compiled by the FRA — which we used for the analysis — is largely the same as what the states have.
NJ Advance Media requested records from every state but Hawaii, which has only eight public crossings, to see if the data they use is the same as what the federal government collects. Thirty-seven states, including New Jersey, said they use some or all of the federal data in making safety decisions, while only seven states said they use different data. (Five states didn’t respond.)
“You’ve uncovered a scandal,” said Carl Berkowitz, a New York-based transportation engineer who has served as an expert witness in crossing fatality cases. “This really needs to be brought to the attention of the congressional committee.”
When ‘fail-safe’ equipment fails
The warning lights were dark and the safety gates were vertical when Brian Frazier approached the railroad crossing.
He was driving three friends through Anoka, Minnesota late one fall night in 2003. They had left a high school football game and were heading to a party for a friend deploying for military duty in Afghanistan.
As Frazier neared the crossing on Ferry Street around 10 p.m., nothing indicated it was unsafe to cross.
But when his Chevrolet Cavalier touched the rails, a 33-car freight train came barreling from the west, hitting the vehicle at nearly 60 mph. Frazier, 20, and his three passengers, Bridgette Shannon, 17, Corey Chase, 20, and Harry Rhoades, Jr., 19, were killed.
Equipment failures like that aren’t supposed to happen. Federal regulations require safety equipment at railroad crossings to alert drivers even when it’s not working properly, a concept known as the fail-safe principle. When the equipment malfunctions, warning lights are supposed to flash and the gates are designed to drop, blocking the crossing.
But purportedly fail-safe equipment fails regularly, sometimes with devastating consequences. Safety equipment has failed to activate more than 8,000 times since 2000 when a train came through a crossing, according to FRA records. That’s more than once per day, a huge number that has drawn little federal scrutiny. However, failure rates have fallen in recent years, the agency says.
Since railroads — which are responsible for maintaining their crossing equipment — rarely face repercussions if they fail to report the malfunctions, the federal count might be just a fraction of the true number. A New York Times investigation in 2004 found several instances when railroads did not report these failures. Our investigation found numerous others, including the Anoka and New Iberia crashes.
Indeed, the federal government has known for decades that the technology widely used at crossings can be unreliable.
A 1981 report commissioned by the U.S. DOT found that emerging safety technology was prone to failure and needed more work before it could be deployed on a wide scale. That same system has since been rolled out nationwide. Crossing safety equipment is vulnerable to numerous factors, from lightning strikes and electromagnetic interference to something as simple as sand or rust accumulating on the rails, industry experts acknowledge.
FRA spokesman Warren Flatau said safety technology has moved well beyond the 1981 standards and suggested a comparison between then and now is unfair. Still, many of the failures reported in the FRA’s database were caused by the same factors responsible for equipment failure decades ago.
In the case of the Minnesota crossing, BNSF acknowledged in court that the equipment had malfunctioned in the months before the 2003 crash.
“The railroads and FRA will claim that circuits are fail-safe. They are not,” said Comer, the railroad accident investigator from Ohio. “The circuits can and often do fail.”
The FRA has been a proponent of the safety technology — a system called constant warning time — because it gives drivers a realistic expectation of when a train will arrive at the crossing.
Despite the technology’s long-established pattern of failures, the FRA is still sanctioning its use all over the country.
“Almost without exception, where there is equipment, that equipment is functioning,” said Alexy, the FRA’s top safety official. He did acknowledge that the equipment does fail, but said it does not violate the law. “That happens, and that’s something that does occur. ... That does happen too frequently for us.”
When the safety technology works properly, which it does most of the time, it makes drivers aware of trains and helps keep them off the tracks. But the fail-safe requirement is intended to protect drivers even when the equipment is malfunctioning.
Berkowitz, the accident investigator from New York, said railroads should build redundancy into the equipment. If the main safety system isn’t working, have a backup.
The problem is such measures are expensive.
“Redundancy doubles the cost,” Berkowitz said. “Cost — that’s the bottom line in transportation.”
Alexy echoed that cost was an obstacle. He said the FRA does an adequate job regulating the railroads, but it could do better if it had more funding or authority.
“We’d have a difficult time justifying the cost of that redundancy,” he said.
The sheer number of crossings in the United States also contributes to the problem. It has about 200,000 if you include crossings on private land, which aren’t regulated in the same way.
Nearly 40% of the 120,000 public crossings don’t have warning lights or gates, federal data shows.
Misplaced blame
Minutes after the Sunset Limited hit Phyllis LeBlanc’s Ford Taurus, word of the New Iberia crash began ricocheting through BNSF.
Chris Duffell, a signal maintenance supervisor overseeing that location, was at a nearby Holiday Inn when his phone rang with a notification from the company’s nerve center. Thirty minutes later, Duffell parked his truck near the crossing.
Duffel said in a deposition that his first move was to make sure no one went inside the metal shed next to the crossing. It houses equipment capable of revealing exactly what happened before the crash.
News reports from the days after the incident quoted a BNSF spokesman who said the crossing safety equipment was working properly — which is contested in the lawsuit — and that the Amtrak locomotive had a camera. Video from the crash has never been made public.
Duffell’s reaction was typical of railroad employees when they show up after deadly crashes — sometimes arriving even before police.
While local cops can interview witnesses and observe the crossing, they have no jurisdiction over the railroad’s crossing equipment and are legally forbidden from drug testing the train crew. Only the railroad’s own private police force, other employees, the FRA and the National Transportation Safety Board have jurisdiction to fully investigate rail crashes. In rare cases, other federal law enforcement agencies, like the FBI, can get involved.
Local police are not even entitled to data from the black boxes on the locomotive or at the crossing. This data can reveal train speed, whether the engineer sounded the horn, and if the lights and gates worked properly.
While the FRA and the NTSB do have the power to investigate these incidents, they don’t often use that authority. The FRA investigated only 95 crossing accidents from 2006 to 2017, 0.4% of all crashes in that timeframe, according to an agency report. The NTSB investigates even fewer rail crossing accidents.
“The reason FRA investigates so few (relatively speaking) is because in 95% of cases the actions and behavior of roadway users are determined to be the primary causal factor,” FRA spokesman Flatau said in a statement.
Unless there’s a report of equipment malfunction or railroad violations, the FRA has “no basis” to investigate, he added. But that’s almost always based on the railroad’s word on what caused the accident.
Limited resources also play a role.
“There are multiple accidents every day, and at some point, we have to understand that we can’t get to every one of them,” Alexy said. “Derailments, things happening across the entire railroad.
“Someone getting killed at a grade crossing is very important, but there are other larger issues on the railroads that we have to get to.”
The lack of independent scrutiny has resulted in railroads pushing their own, sometimes false, narratives of crashes. They also have spent millions to spread their version of events.
In the 1970s, Union Pacific launched Operation Lifesaver, a public relations effort to polish the railroad’s reputation when it came to rail crashes. Now an independent organization, Operation Lifesaver is the primary voice nationwide on crossing safety, pushing a message leaning heavily on driver responsibility. But even though Operation Lifesaver is no longer under the umbrella of Union Pacific, it still gets about one-third of its funding from railroads, said Executive Director Rachel Maleh.
Gavalla, the former FRA safety officer, said Operation Lifesaver’s messaging is too focused on driver responsibility.
“I think their educational message is off-base,” he said. “It’s not a matter of recklessness, most of the time.”
But sometimes the industry’s efforts aren’t so subtle. BNSF made a more flagrant attempt at changing the narrative after the crash that killed Brian Frazier and three others in Anoka, Minnesota nearly two decades ago.
The railroad claimed warning lights at the crossing were flashing and Frazier swung around downed gates — a reckless decision that cost four lives, officials said at the scene of the crash, in the report filed to the federal government and later in protracted litigation.
And that narrative might have been the official record of their deaths had their families not sued BNSF.
The ensuing trial revealed not only was it physically impossible for Frazier to have swerved around the gates, but also that BNSF had recorded problems with the safety equipment prior to the crash.
A jury awarded the victims’ families $21.6 million in damages in 2008, and the court later imposed $4.2 million in sanctions on BNSF for its conduct throughout the ordeal, one of the largest court-imposed sanctions ever put on a railroad.
The Anoka County District Court found BNSF guilty of destroying and misrepresenting evidence, obstructing a police investigation, violating its own procedures for handling crashes and evidence and pressuring witnesses to lie under oath, to point out just a few of the violations. A judge in the case said the railroad’s efforts to cover up the accident went on for years.
“But the breadth of BNSF’s misconduct in this case is staggering; beginning within minutes of the accident, up to and through the trial,” Judge Ellen Maas wrote. “Plaintiffs have established that BNSF’s misconduct did indeed strain the limits of the civil justice system and this Court is on firm ground to impose significant sanctions.”
Frazier did nothing wrong. The gates never went down, the trial revealed.
It’s a common tactic of the railroads, and sometimes even the FRA, to claim reckless driving causes most accidents. But only 23% of crossing accidents between 2016 and 2020 can be blamed on drivers going around or through gates or other barricades, or on suicides, federal data shows.
“If there is anything harmful to the railroad, they will lose event recorders, or say it was erased,” said Richard Beall, a former railroad engineer turned whistleblower. “The railroad will try to tell you that safety is the first importance, but when something happens, you’ll realize safety is all talk.”
‘My little boy ... he’s gone’
In the spring of 2016, the families of Brandon and Chase Day, Jayla Daigle, Trinity Schmidt and Steven LeBlanc Jr. sued BNSF over the crash. Litigation is ongoing, but court records and deposition transcripts obtained by NJ Advance Media raise serious questions about the railroad’s actions.
The crossing was equipped with three event recorders, which track whether the safety equipment was working properly. After the crash, BNSF says it has no usable data from any of the devices. One was unplugged prior to the crash. Another was allegedly corrupted and spit out gibberish. And the third was not downloaded until its memory was overwritten, a direct violation of company protocol, based on depositions from several BNSF employees.
Gavalla said he noticed a similar pattern during his time at the FRA: After crossing crashes, railroads would often claim their event recorders weren’t working properly.
In the months before the New Iberia crash — just as in the Anoka, Minnesota incident — equipment at the crossing had malfunctioned, according to records and BNSF employees’ testimony in depositions.
Immediately after the crash, with the train sitting feet from the crossing and bodies scattered in its wake, BNSF employees admitted the safety equipment was malfunctioning. The lights and gates were repeatedly activating and then turning off.
But this information never made it to police on the scene or in a federal report filed after the crash.
Nathan Karlin, the Kansas-based attorney representing the victims with multiple co-counsels, says those malfunctions actually caused the crash.
The lawsuit claims the crossing’s safety equipment was malfunctioning as Phyllis LeBlanc approached. She could see the warning lights flashing and the gates descending, only for them to reset. When LeBlanc got closer to the crossing, Karlin says the lights and gates again activated and abruptly stopped, allowing both LeBlanc and the car in front of her to proceed. The car in front got hung up at the stop sign — which federal guidelines say should be a traffic light connected to the crossing equipment — and LeBlanc was forced to stop on the tracks.
When the lights and gates activated again, a train was actually coming and her car was trapped.
But BNSF has maintained that Phyllis LeBlanc was at fault for stopping her car on the tracks.
The families’ case against BNSF is scheduled to go to trial in August, having been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
In July 2019, BNSF was sanctioned in Louisiana court for spoliation of evidence over the event recorders. The railroad has since appealed the sanction.
BNSF declined to comment on the New Iberia crash, citing the ongoing litigation. The company said it “complies with all FRA and NTSB regulations and guidelines” and spends more than $100 million annually on “grade-crossing maintenance, improvement and safety programs.”
But BNSF, like all the railroads, is legally required to pay for the upkeep of its crossing equipment, part of an agreement with federal and state governments where taxpayers fund it if the railroads maintain it.
What deepens the New Iberia tragedy is that the issues contributing to the crash — and countless other incidents around the country — aren’t intractable.
New legislation could require states to update the data on their crossings, much as Congress mandated for railroads in 2008. The FRA could commit to investigating more crashes or it could reexamine crossing safety technologies. Congress could also allocate more funding and give the FRA teeth to enforce guidelines that often go ignored, handing the agency tools to properly regulate the railroads.
“As far as I’m concerned, to install some simple safety measures ... would have saved the lives of five people,” said Keith Day, father of Brandon and Chase Day. “They knew about this crossing because I know about two wrecks where people have lost their lives. The cost of something as simple as some safety features would have saved their lives.
“They ought to be held responsible for the death of all those people.”
Whether the political will exists to battle the railroad industry, which would almost certainly lobby against any new legislation or regulation, is another matter entirely.
New Jersey Congressman Donald M. Payne Jr., D-10th Dist., is among the federal lawmakers calling for improved safety at rail crossings.
“I am extremely concerned anytime Americans face a life-threatening safety issue related to our nation’s railroad infrastructure,” said Payne, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. “We need to improve the safety of our nation’s highway-railway grade crossings, and we take steps to do it in the Moving Forward Act.”
The bill calls for additional funding to remove crossings and improve safety at those that can’t be eliminated. The bill passed the House last summer, but has not received a vote in the Senate.
Pottroff, the lawyer who initially brought the suit on behalf of the New Iberia families, believed that without legislation, railroads would continue avoiding responsibility for crossing deaths. (Pottroff passed away in 2019, and the case has been taken on by Karlin, his law partner.)
For her part, Barbara LeBlanc — who lost her adult son Steven in the crash — avoided the crossing since the day shortly after the incident when she and her husband laid a wooden cross in the grassy ditch near the tracks.
Steven LeBlanc Jr.’s cross — joined by markers memorializing the other four victims — sits close to where their bodies were thrown. Two other crosses, weathered by time, were placed on the other side of the tracks — reminders of the 13 other crashes at that crossing.
When I first met her in 2016, Barbara recounted visiting her son in the hospital, knowing his injuries were too severe for him to pull through.
“I’m not ready for an apology,” Barbara said, her Cajun accent weighed down with grief. “I want somebody to fix that track. At least that life would have been for something.”
Barbara LeBlanc died earlier this year, before she could learn if anyone will be held responsible for the violent crash.
The Days are still waiting. They said Brandon doesn’t talk about the crash — he never has. He couldn’t even if he wanted to.
The Amtrak train that took his brother, grandmother, step-grandfather and two of his friends also took a chunk of his memory. He doesn’t remember anything from when he left his 12th birthday party at the trampoline park until he woke up in a Baton Rouge hospital.
Keith and Jody Day carry on, trying to stay strong for Brandon. But every milestone he hits reminds them of the son who isn’t here. When Brandon got his driver’s license, Chase, his twin, should have been right beside him.
“It’s been the hardest time of our lives,” Keith Day said. “My little boy, there’s nothing that can bring him back.
“He’s gone, you know.”

Officers received the call at 12:40 p.m., according to Sgt. Miguel Valenzuela, and found the 2000 Lexus LS300 wedged between the southbound train and the barrier separating the tracks from the street.
“Once officers arrived at the scene, we escorted everyone off the train,” Valenzuela said.
A 60-year-old female passenger who was on the train heading to Downtown Long Beach when the accident occurred said she and fellow passengers felt a “jolt” when the train collided with the car on the corner of Long Beach Boulevard and 14th Street. Shortly after, the woman—who declined to give her name—said the conductor came to check on her and fellow passengers, but no injuries were reported at the time.
Around 12:50 p.m., passengers could be seen filing out of the train cars toward nearby bus stations.
The driver and passenger of the silver Lexus also reported no injuries. The driver, 53-year-old Rebecca Howard, was visibly shaken by the crash. The Harbor City resident said she was on her way to the nearby Greyhound station, where she planned to embark on a trip to South Carolina to attend her father’s funeral.
“I’m not even gonna make it there now,” Howard said.
After mistaking 14th Street for Anaheim Street, Howard said she made a U-turn, which is when the car collided with the train. Denette Snyder, 47, the owner of the car and a passenger at the time of the crash, said she was scratching off a lottery ticket and didn’t see the train moving toward the car. “I just felt the train hit us,” Snyder said.
Tony Moro, 51, was inspecting tracks nearby when he heard there had been a collision a few blocks north. A veteran of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Moro said that for the two people in the vehicle to walk off unscathed was not a common occurrence.
“The stuff I’ve seen, I didn’t even see in the military,” Moro said of other crashes. “That right there, that’s a rare thing.”",A-Line Metro,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Friday,12:40 p.m.,Long Beach Boulevard and 14th Street,California,California,Unknown,Long Beach,Long Beach Boulevard,J,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,C,No Car Unit in Train,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,C,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,9,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

One Saturday in the early 1950s, a work train, its work done for the day, was parked on an auxiliary track at the station. As a steam locomotive—oil-fired Mikado No. 3139—was the power for the work train, it was necessary to have an engine watchman present to keep steam pressure up during the time the work train was not working and the crew was getting their rest. The engine watchman’s job was not very desirable, and consequently fell to the lowest fireman on the seniority list.
The station at Serra was a picturesque little structure of white stucco with a red clay tile roof, located on the west end of a sweeping 50-mph curve, with the first panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean that one gets from the train as the railroad joins the surf on its way to San Diego.
The young engine watchman, sent down from Los Angeles, arrived at Serra on Saturday evening to watch the work train engine for Saturday night and Sunday. The engine had to be ready to go to work early Monday morning. The watchman’s duties were minimal, keeping pressure at a workable level, water in the boiler, and supplying the engine with sand and lubricating oil. Steam pressure was maintained by periodically starting up the fire, building up steam pressure so that the water injectors would work to supply water to the boiler, then putting the fire out. The engine then needed little attention for two or three hours as its steam pressure and boiler-water level slowly dropped. Then the procedure would be repeated to build up steam and boiler-water level again. (Unlike coal-fired engines, oil-burners can have their fires started or extinguished quickly.)
The job was boring. A young man might be tempted to briefly slip away from his post in search of some diversion, yet there surely was not much going on at Serra on a Saturday night. However, on the big Marine Corps Air Base at Irvine, a station about seven miles west of Serra, there was a USO dance on Saturday nights.
The young fireman at this point apparently decided—contrary to railroad rules—that he could build up steam pressure and fill the boiler with water, put out the fire, and leave the engine for a few hours. He could drive to the Marine base, spend a couple of hours at the dance, and get back to the engine in time to build up the steam pressure that had leaked down.
The exact sequence of events, and the duration of the watchman’s absence, will never be known for sure. But what apparently happened is that when he returned to the locomotive, he got up into the cab and noticed the steam pressure had dropped considerably. He immediately started the fire in the firebox to start rebuilding the steam pressure. Either he did not check the water level in the boiler, or he thought he could see water in the water glass gauge without checking the positive gauge cocks. Sometimes the water glasses would get stopped up with boiler sediment and register a higher-than-actual water level.
With a big fire going, the crown sheet of boiler firebox attained a very high temperature. At this time, the fireman decided to start the injector to replenish the water supply to the boiler. The injector syphons water from the locomotive tender—which is very cold relative to the boiler interior—into the boiler to produce steam.
Most everyone knows what happens to drops of water that fall into a hot skillet on the stove; imagine this reaction magnified thousands of times. When the cold water hit the white-hot crown sheet of the boiler, there was a tremendous explosion. The boiler separated from the frame and traveled through the air like a giant projectile. It hit the roof of the Serra depot, tore off the top of the roof, and landed about 200 yards away from where the locomotive was. The track under the engine was blown away, forming a large crater. Parts of the locomotive were strewn around in all directions. Needless to say, as is nearly always the case with boiler explosions, the young engine watchman did not survive this violent destruction.
Boiler explosions were rare in the later decades of the steam era, yet they were grimly memorable. I passed the scene of this accident the next day on train N076 to San Diego. The destruction and tremendous power of the explosion, the only one whose aftermath I ever witnessed, remains vivid in my memory today, several decades later.

The 60-year-old suffered broken bones and major internal injuries. He said he continues to deal with pain, but he is thankful to be alive to tell his story.
""Fortunate for me, I got hit on the left side of my car and the train pushed me back out and that's how the car did not end up on the tracks,"" he said. ""If I didn't survive that accident, no one would know about this.""
He said he believes his accident could have been prevented, and he wants to see changes before other drivers are hurt or killed.
""I was allowed to enter the intersection and there was no gate to stop me from entering the intersection,"" he said.
A spokesperson for the L.A. Metro said they performed a post-accident inspection their equipment and found that all warning lights, crossing gates, and warning bells were functioning at the time of the accident. They also said the driver made an illegal left turn and used the wrong traffic lane to circumvent the lowered crossing gate.
""Regardless of what they're saying about I entered on the wrong lane, no one should be allowed to enter period,"" Moss said about the statement.

The Pacific Harbor Line train derailed Tuesday, running through the end of the track and crashing through barriers, finally coming to rest about 250 yards from the docked naval ship.
Federal prosecutors allege train engineer Eduardo Moreno, 44, of San Pedro intended to hit the ship, saying he thought it was ""suspicious"" and did not believe ""the ship is what they say it's for.'""
The train crashed into a concrete barrier at the end of the track, smashed through a steel barrier and a chain-link fence, slid through one parking lot and then a second lot filled with gravel and hit a second chain-link fence. It came to rest after passing under a ramp leading to the Vincent Thomas Bridge. The train remained in that position Wednesday.
No one was injured in the derailment, but the train leaked fuel that required a hazmat response.
Authorities say Moreno admitted to crashing the train intentionally, but said he did not plan it out in advance. It is believed that he acted alone.
He allegedly made statements to a CHP officer that included ""You only get this chance once. The whole world is watching. I had to. People don't know what's going on here. Now they will.""
Officials say video from inside the train's cab shows Moreno holding a lighted flare during the incident.
Moreno has been charged with one count of train wrecking, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison.
The Mercy arrived at the Port of Los Angeles this weekend.
The Navy hospital ship was brought in to handle non-coronavirus patients, to help ease the burden of local hospitals that are surging with COVID-19 cases.

Authorities say the fiery collision occurred shortly after 5:30 a.m. near the intersection of Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues. Fire crews believe the RV stalled at the Rosecrans Avenue intersection and was struck by the OC Line 681, which was carrying over 100 passengers and was heading from Orange County to Los Angeles.
Dramatic video shared on social media shows the moment the train slammed into the RV and pushed it along the track. The video appears to show people fleeing from the RV, and witnesses told police four people were seen running from the site of the collision moments before the crash.
Firefighters were seen dousing flames that gutted the vehicle and charred a rail car. Smoke from the fire could be seen for several miles.

Shortly after the collision, a freight train arrived on the parallel tracks.
""You could hear it coming, and it was coming really fast, you could tell,"" Lozano said.
Another passenger said he braced for potential impact as he heard the sound of the freight train quickly approaching.
""That was honestly the longest few seconds of my life, like when I heard the train horn coming, I was just looking around, everyone was looking around, are we even going to be safe? Do they know that this just happened? Because it sounded like they didn't,"" Ryan Hajek described.
The freight train ran over debris from the crash before coming to a stop as the fire from the Metrolink train started to spread.
AIR7 HD was over the scene, where dozens of evacuated passengers waited in a nearby parking lot while crews battled the flames. Four passengers who suffered minor injuries were treated and later released, according to officials.
""The hit was such an impact on the train,"" passenger Rosalind Carter said. ""I remember being flung into the seat next to me, I hit my head, it was just pretty traumatic.""

An investigation was underway Friday morning after a Metrolink passenger train collided with a vehicle in Santa Fe Springs.

Firefighters worked quickly to extinguish a blaze that ignited after a Metrolink commuter train collided with a recreational vehicle in Santa Fe Springs before dawn Friday.
The crash occurred just before 6 a.m. near Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues, said Eric Ortiz, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The commuter train, RV and an adjacent freight train all caught fire.
Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said 120 passengers were on the Orange County 681 Line train headed toward Los Angeles at the time of the crash. No passengers were injured and everyone was evacuated safely, Johnson said. The train operator, who was closest to the collision, is also safe, he said. It was not immediately clear whether anyone in the RV was injured.
All trains that run along the same tracks, including the Perris Valley 91 Line and Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner trains, will experience delays. Johnson said Metrolink does not have an estimate for how long delays will be.
Passengers aboard the 681 Line and the trains that followed, including the 601 and the 603, can receive a voucher for ride-hailing services because of the delays. Evacuated passengers were being bused to Union Station.
“Passengers who typically take one of those lines into Los Angeles may want to consider alternate transportation this morning,” he said. “We don’t anticipate this to be a quick clearance.”
Johnson said he did not have details about the circumstances of the collision. The Whittier Police Department is investigating.
By 6:35 a.m., the flames had been extinguished, leaving behind the charred RV. Video showed fire officials entering the front of the Metronlink train, which was significantly damaged in the blaze.

SANTA FE SPRINGS, Calif. - A vehicle erupted in flames after it was struck by a Metrolink train on its tracks in Santa Fe Springs on Friday morning, authorities said.
The OC Line 681 was headed toward Union Station in downtown Los Angeles when the crash occurred at the intersection of Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues just after 6 a.m.
""I had my headphones on, so I didn't hear anything, but there was a big bump before the train stopped completely and people were rattled. The lights went out for about 30 seconds or so. We all started looking outside the window and saw debris on the track,"" a passenger aboard the train when it crashed told FOX 11.
All tracks between Buena Park and Norwalk Santa Fe Springs were closed until further notice. Metrolink apologized to passengers for the inconvenience as a result of the fiery crash.

Officials said 300 people were aboard the train and were evacuated safely. Buses were deployed to transport passengers to an alternative station.
The RV was abandoned at the time of the crash and four passengers sustained minor injuries. They were treated and released, officials said.

- Share via
Reporting from Cairo — A fight between two train conductors unleashed a speeding, unmanned locomotive that slammed into a barrier and exploded in the Egyptian capital’s main train station Wednesday, killing at least 25 people, authorities said.
Railway officials said the single railcar collided head-on with the buffer stop, causing a huge explosion and fire. At least 47 people were also injured, many of them critically, and officials said the death toll could rise.
The deadly blaze blasted through people on the platform in the busy Ramses Station in downtown Cairo. A surveillance video showed the moment of impact when the car barreled past men and women walking by and engulfed them in flames and smoke. Charred bodies lay on the platform, and a man in flames ran down a staircase in panic, according to other photos and videos posted on social media.
Egyptian prosecutor General Nabil Sadek said investigators determined the locomotive’s conductor had left his car to fight with another conductor whose railcar was blocking his.
But the conductor left without putting on the brakes, and the other car began moving backward, freeing the locomotive, which then gathered speed and hit the concrete-and-metal barrier, exploding.
“The driver left the railcar without taking any measures to brake it,” Sadek said in a statement.
Sadek put the death toll at 20 while health officials said at least 25 people had been killed and dozens more injured in the crash and ensuing fire. Some of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, and DNA tests were carried out to determine identities.
The driver of the railcar has been under interrogation, and Sadek said the investigation was continuing.
The deadly accident prompted Transportation Minister Hisham Arafat to resign his post, according to a statement released by the Cabinet office.
The Ramses district is among the busiest and most crowded areas of Cairo. The state railway agency briefly halted all train traffic and ordered the evacuation of the station.
The accident triggered an online debate among Egyptians, with many blaming the government for not improving railway services, even after a series of deadly accidents. Several noted previous statements by President Abdel Fattah Sisi arguing about spending billions of pounds on improving trains.
Video from surveillance cameras showed flames ravaging the station’s interior. One video that surfaced on social media showed men and women carrying bags and personal belongings and walking on the rail platforms as the train car crashed and exploded.
Another showed men and women running and searching for exits after the explosion. A man is seen running back and forth, his shirt on fire, until another man rushes to pour water on him.
A weakened opposition resists push to keep Egypt’s Sisi in power until 2034 »
Mohammed Said, head of the Cairo railways hospital, said at least 25 people were killed but that the death toll could rise.
Many of the wounded were in critical condition, mostly suffering severe burns, said Egyptian Health Minister Hala Zayed.
Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli vowed harsh punishment for those behind the accident.
Egypt’s railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and poor management. Official figures show that 1,793 train accidents took place in 2017 across the country.
In July 2018, a passenger train derailed near the southern city of Aswan, injuring at least six people and prompting authorities to fire the chief of the country’s railways.
In March last year, Sisi said the government lacked about 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $14.1 billion, to overhaul the run-down rail system. He spoke a day after a passenger train collided with a cargo train, killing at least 12 people, including a child.
In August 2017, two passenger trains collided in northern Egypt, just outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, killing 43 people. In 2016, at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.
The deadliest train crash took place in 2002 when more 300 people were killed when fire erupted in a speeding train traveling from Cairo to southern Egypt.

An Amtrak train that hit a downed tree in Oregon stranded 183 passengers for more than 24 hours.
The Coast Starlight train, headed to Los Angeles from Seattle, stopped in Oakridge, Oregon, around 6:20 p.m. Sunday. By Monday night, passengers remained stuck inside the train as heavy snow and road closures in the area reportedly made it difficult to get to them.
Amtrak chief operating officer Scot Naparstek told USA TODAY in a statement that the company worked with local resources to rescue the passengers, who were en route to Eugene, Oregon, on Tuesday morning. The company said no one was injured.
""With more than a foot of heavy snow and numerous trees blocking the track, we made every decision in the best interest of the safety of our customers during the unfortunate sequence of events,"" Naparstek said. ""With local power outages and blocked roads, it was decided the safest place for our customers was to remain on the train where we were able to provide food, heat, electricity and toilets.""
Passenger Rebekah Dodson shared a Facebook live video, photos and a plea for help from the train.
""Please, if anyone is out there, share. I am one of the 183 stranded...35 hours and counting... No rescue in sight,"" she posted early Tuesday morning.
Just before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, Dodson tweeted ""we have an engine!""
Kim Song, the mother of a stranded passenger, told KATU that Amtrak staff told her daughter she'd be charged for a blanket while waiting for help on the train. Other passengers reported being charged for food, a claim the company said wasn't true.
Naparstek said Amtrak will be contacting customers to provide refunds and ""other compensation as appropriate.""

MOBILE, Ala. – In the dark of night, three travelers advanced inexorably toward tragedy.
Accompanied by her parents on her first train trip, 11-year-old Andrea Chancey couldn’t sleep despite the steady rocking of the Amtrak coach. Aboard the same train after missing a flight, Ken Ivory lounged nearby. Miles away, Willie C. Odom steered a towboat as it pushed barges up a river that was getting foggier by the mile.
A bump. A whoosh. A ball of fire.
Suddenly, those three and more than 200 other people were caught up in what remains the deadliest accident in Amtrak history, the derailment of the Los Angeles-to-Miami Sunset Limited in a south Alabama bayou in 1993. Forty-seven people died and more than 100 others were hurt.
Nearly 25 years later, the survivors remember that night vividly: “I smell the oil. I see the fire. I hear the screaming,” said Chancey, now 36.
But many others forgot about the disaster as other tragedies occurred, one after the other, through the years.
Once survivors and victims were plucked out of a river delta so remote it’s called “America’s Amazon,” the National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigation. The agency held a public hearing in Mobile, just miles from the bayou, made multiple recommendations to improve safety, and the world moved on.
The same will no doubt happen in the aftermath of a string of three Amtrak accidents earlier this year that killed a total of six people and injured about 170 others in Washington, Virginia and South Carolina.
But for those who witnessed the horror of people drowning in rail cars at Big Bayou Canot, everything comes rushing back with every Amtrak disaster. It’s particularly true for Chancey, whose parents both died in the crash.
Chancey sometimes wonders why she lived when so many others died. Did one of her parents lift her out of the bayou waters before drowning, as news reports at the time said, or did God save her for something special? Or was it simply luck?
Ivory, a Texas oil industry worker who helped save Chancey all those years ago, has a theory.
“She was the chosen one,” said Ivory of Houston.
Retired Marine Lt. Col. Geary L. Chancey, a pilot and Vietnam veteran, and wife Mary Jane Chancey, a schoolteacher, adopted Andrea when she was only a few weeks old. Born with severe cerebral palsy, their girl would need assistance the rest of her life; she still uses a wheelchair and has home health-care aides who cook and clean for her.
The family was living in Orange Park, Florida, in 1993 when they boarded Amtrak’s Sunset Limited for a trip to visit relatives in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Andrea’s wheelchair made boarding more difficult than for other passengers, but she was thrilled about her first train ride.
“I thought it was the coolest thing,” said Chancey, speaking with The Associated Press in her first interview since the accident.
Their visit to the Gulf Coast done, the Chanceys board the eastbound Sunset Limited toward home at Biloxi, Mississippi, the night of Sept. 21, 1993. The train was running about 30 minutes late because of an air conditioning problem that was repaired in New Orleans.
TAKE A LOOK BACK AT THE PNJ COVERAGE OF THE CRASH:
Around the same time, Willie Odom was piloting the towboat Mauvilla as it pushed six barges away from a wharf in Mobile and up the winding Mobile River. The journey would take the boat northward into the Mobile-Tensaw Delta.
With the landscape shrouded in fog, a confused Odom unknowingly turned off the river into Big Bayou Canot, a narrow, non-navigable waterway that snakes through the delta and is crossed by a railroad bridge that lacked lights. As Odom tried to find a tree to tie up until the fog lifted, records show, a barge struck a bridge support, bending the rail tracks more than one yard out of line just eight minutes before the Amtrak train arrived.
On board the Sunset Limited, Andrea Chancey was trying to doze off as the train click-clacked through the night.
“My dad was sitting in front of my mom and I was sitting next to my mom, and for some reason I couldn’t sleep,” said Chancey. “I had my head on her belly and she was rubbing me.”
Traveling at 72 mph (116 kph), the lead locomotive reached the bridge and jumped the track at the spot where the rails were bent by the barge collision. The 3,000-horsepower, 240-ton engine flew across the bayou, embedding in about 46 feet of mud on the opposite bank. Two other locomotives followed it into the water, along with a baggage car, a crew dorm car and two passenger coaches.
Chancey remembers tumbling as her double-decker coach, Car No. 34083, sailed off the end of the bridge and into the bayou.
Her mother “pushed me and I fell and I saw my dad fall and when the water came in it was like, ‘Wow,’” she said. “And everything went black.”
Chancey doesn’t recall seeing either of her parents again, possibly because of water rushing into the car and inky darkness – the only light came from burning diesel fuel that spilled from the locomotives. But she does remember a few people who got her out of the wreckage, including Ivory, who had decided to take the train to North Carolina to see his wife only after missing a commercial flight.
Ivory said he was on the upper level of the train getting people out of the bottom level when someone thrust the child above the water that was filling the coach. It was pitch black, the only light coming from burning diesel fuel just yards away.
“Whoever it was was being consumed by the water at that time,” he recalled. “I didn’t ever get to see who handed her up, but I assumed it was her parents.”
After the crash, Andrea was hospitalized with injuries that included oil inhalation. It was left to relatives to tell her that her parents had died.
The “miracle child,” as the media called her, went to live with the family of her mother’s older sister in Lancaster, Ohio, until she was 18. Her upkeep was funded partly by a trust fund set up by Amtrak and CSX, which owned the bridge.
After briefly attending Wright State University and a failed marriage, Chancey wound up back on the Mississippi coast in Biloxi, where she lives today in an apartment with an assistance dog. Still in a wheelchair, she has help during daylight hours from home health aides.
Chancey gets news alerts on her phone, and she’s always shaken when another passenger train crashes.
“Whenever I see Amtrak has another accident, I call my aunt and I say, ‘They did it again. They did it again,’” she said.
Ivory, who was honored by the Coast Guard with another passenger, Michael Dopheide, for his life-saving efforts that night, also struggled with the aftermath. He wondered both why he survived and why he couldn’t save more people. For a while, the smell of diesel fuel took him back to the scene of the crash; he figures his work in oil fields where diesel is abundant helped him tamp down the response.
Odom, the towboat pilot, was named as a defendant in more than 90 lawsuits after the crash but never faced criminal charges. He told investigators he felt a “bump” as he was pushing the barges that night but didn’t realize what had happened until he heard a “whoosh” and saw the glow of fire through the fog. Still near the crash site, the Mauvilla and its crew helped pull people from the water.
Odom did not respond to an interview request. He hasn’t worked in the river industry since and has struggled for more than two decades with the guilt and pain of what happened, said brother Morsco Odom – though over time, his anguish has eased a bit.
“The nightmares aren’t as bad,” he said.
Andrea Chancey didn’t attend a memorial service held in 2016 to honor victims of the crash, and she’s never seen a monument erected at the site of the repaired bridge recalling the disaster.
Despite worsening health problems linked in part to cerebral palsy, Chancey expresses less concern about herself than for Odom, who she doesn’t blame for the loss of her parents.
The bayou bridge should have been in better shape to begin with, she said, and Amtrak has had too many accidents in the years since. Willie Odom has suffered enough, Chancey said, particularly considering he helped save 17 people after the crash – including her – using the same towboat that hit the bridge.
“I don’t blame him one bit,” Chancey said.
Ivory, too, holds nothing against Odom. Too much time has passed, he said.
But ever since the crash, Ivory said, he has always checked on airline flights well in advance.
“I haven’t taken another train since then,” said Ivory.",Amtrak,CSX,CSX,Unknown,09/21/1993,Unknown,Unknown,Mississippi,Mobile,AL,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,B,3 (Bottom level),Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,4 (Fog),4 (Fog),B,1 (Main),Unknown,Unknown,3 (Three locomotives),Unknown,Unknown,3 (East),3,Not specified,F,2,Not specified,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Andrea Chancey,Unknown,Unknown

The Southern Pacific Lark passenger train, traveling at about 40 mph, crashed into a truck stuck at a railroad crossing in Glendale.
An article in the Oct. 20, 1935, Los Angeles Times reported:
The southbound Southern Pacific Lark, rolling through Glendale yesterday, smashed into a seven-ton truck loaded with sand and the impact derailed both the train’s locomotives, two coaches, tore up a section of track and sent twelve passengers and trainmen to hospitals.
Leaping from the driver’s seat of the truck when he saw the impending collision, E. J. Chaney of 213 West Windsor Road, Glendale, escaped death by inches and was only slightly hurt. He was hauling sand for the Consolidated Rock Products Company.
Careening off the roadbed, the lead locomotive of the sixteen-car train broke loose and plowed a deep furrow through sandy soil for nearly 800 feet before coming to a stop at an angle that all but turned over. …
The crash occurred at Aviation Drive, a little-used road through a dump at the southeast end of Grand Central Air Terminal, at a point across San Fernando Road opposite the west end of Doran Street.
More than 170 passengers aboard the Lark, coming from San Francisco and within a half-hour of their Los Angeles destination, were severely shaken up when the crash came at 8:40 a.m. ….
As shown in the images below, not only did news photographers have great access to the accident, so did the general public — quite the opposite of today.

As about 200 people solemnly looked on, some of them teary-eyed, Ventura County Supervisor Linda Parks clanged a bell for each of the 25 people killed in the Metrolink train crash in Chatsworth 10 years ago this week.
The occasion was a memorial event Wednesday afternoon at Ride On Therapeutic Horsemanship in Chatsworth, not far from the crash site. It was hosted by Los Angeles City Council member Mitch Englander, who represents the area.
The memorial was held to mark the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 12, 2008, crash, one of the worst in U.S. railroad history. Twenty-one of the 25 people killed were from Ventura County, including 10 from Simi Valley.
At roughly the same time as the crash — 4:22 p.m. — Parks started clanging the bell for each of the victims as their names and short biographies were read aloud by other officials in attendance. Those attending included fellow Ventura County Supervisor Peter Foy, Simi Valley City Councilman Glen Becerra and state Assemblyman Dante Acosta, R-Santa Clarita.
Other than reading aloud the brief bios, none of them formally spoke at the event. Englander and Antonio Villaraigosa, who was mayor of Los Angeles at the time of the crash, did.
“We’re here to remember and mark 10 years that have passed since one of the most difficult and tragic events to occur in our community,” Englander told the audience. The crash “forever changed the lives of many.”
“Twenty-five individuals tragically lost, leaving behind families and loved ones,” he said.
Also, 135 people were injured in the crash, 46 critically, he said.
Becerra, the only member of the Simi Valley City Council to attend the memorial, said in an interview that he felt duty-bound to be there.
“Simi Valley suffered the single largest impact of the crash,” he said. “Ten of the 25 fatalities were from Simi Valley.
“So, I just had to be here,” he said. “Unfortunately for a sad occasion, to honor the memory of these victims.”
Also in attendance were some survivors of the crash, relatives of some of those killed, and first responders and citizens who rushed to the scene of the disaster to try to save lives.
Englander asked them to stand and be recognized.
They included Claudia Souser, of Camarillo, whose husband of 28 years, Doyle, was killed in the crash.
“We can’t forget,” she said in an interview. “We have to remember those we love and honor their memory.”
Crash survivor Richard Slavett, 79, who lives near the Simi Valley/Thousand Oaks border, told The Star he miraculously didn’t suffer serious injuries in the accident.
He said the memorial event was “beautiful. It’s well-deserved. He (Englander) did a great job.”
The memorial included prayers, a color guard, the singing of the national anthem and a bagpipe rendition of “Amazing Grace.” A huge American flag hung high in the air, attached to two steep fire engine ladders, in front of the event’s site on Topanga Canyon Boulevard.
Another memorial event was hosted by Metrolink earlier Wednesday at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles.
The accident occurred when Metrolink commuter train 111, traveling from Chatsworth to Simi Valley on the Ventura County line, collided head-on with a Union Pacific freight train traveling in the opposite direction near Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Both trains were going about 42 mph at the time of impact.
A National Transportation Safety Board investigation concluded in January 2010 that the crash was caused by the commuter train’s engineer, Robert Sanchez, who was distracted while sending text messages and ran a red light. Sanchez was one of those killed.
The Metrolink train was operated by Connex Railroad LLC, a subsidiary of French conglomerate Veolia.
Officials say the one positive to come out of the tragedy are safety measures it spurred, most notably positive train control. The technology uses GPS, radio and computers to remotely monitor trains, and is capable of preventing train-to-train crashes, over-speed derailments and unauthorized incursion into work zones.

(KABC) -- A Metrolink train crash changed the lives of dozens of people 10 years ago.
Twenty-five people were killed and more than 100 others were injured when a Metrolink train collided with a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth.
A remembrance was held Wednesday to honor the victims and their families.
Victims' families, survivors and first responders gathered near the site of the crash to reflect.
The crash investigation revealed that the Metrolink train operator was texting and missed all of the warning signs before crashing head-on with the other train.
Erin Anderson and Adam Horwitz were at their jobs at a nearby school. They were literally the first two at the scene of the crash.
""I was able to help someone who survived, so I have a positive outcome from my experience of the crash,"" Anderson said.
""It was overwhelming what we saw, but we knew people needed help, so we made a decision to stay and to do our part,"" Horwitz said.
Among the victims was Tina Mosley's mother, Beverly Mosley.

A Union Pacific Railroad freight train headed south at about 40 mph at 4:22 p.m. exited a tunnel near Chatsworth and came face-toface with northbound Metrolink Train No. 111, which was traveling at about 43 mph on the same track and carrying 127 passengers.
The head-on collision that resulted killed 25 people, including 10 Simi Valley residents, two residents of Thousand Oaks and three Camarillo residents.
Next month, 10 years to the day after that tragic event, officials from the City of Los Angeles will hold a memorial to honor and remember the victims. The event will take place at 3:30 p.m. Wed., Sept. 12 at Ride On Therapeutic Horsemanship, 10860 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Chatsworth. Churches and schools in the area will ring their bells at exactly 4:22 p.m. that day.
The event is being organized by Los Angeles City Council member Mitch Englander. His office has received confirmations from several area dignitaries who plan to attend or send representatives, including state Sen. Henry Stern (D-Calabasas), U.S. Rep. Steve Knight (R-Simi Valley) and members of the Simi Valley City Council, Englander’s spokesperson, Bree Breckenridge, said last week.
Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who was in office when the collision occurred, has confirmed he’ll attend, Breckenridge said. Villaraigosa spent more than 30 hours at the scene after the crash.
Among those killed were Simi Valley residents Alan Buckley, 59; Yi Chao, 71; Spree DeSha, 35; Walter Fuller, 54; Ronald Grace, 55; Michael Hammersley, 45; Gregory Lintner, 48; Donna Lynn Remata, 49; Roger Spacey, 60; and Atul Vyas, 20.
The two victims from Thousand Oaks were Christopher Aiken, 38, and Ernest “Pete” Kish, 47. Also killed were Camarillo residents Dennis Arnold, 75; Aida Magdaleno, 19; and Doyle Souser, 56, and Moorpark residents, Paul Long, 54; Beverly Mosley, 57; Howard Pompel, 69; and Maria Elena Villalobos, 18.
Among the 102 injured people taken to hospitals for treatment, 40 were in critical condition.
In 2010, the National Transportation Safety Board’s final report on the collision concluded it was caused by the engineer, who died in the crash.
NTSB officials said the engineer never saw the red signal at the control point in Topanga “because he was engaged in . . . text messaging, which distracted him from his duties.”",Union Pacific Railroad,Metrolink,Unknown,Unknown,09/12/2008,4:22 p.m.,Unknown,Southern California,California,CA,Unknown,Unknown,B,40 mph,1,3,C,Car Unit in Train - Unknown,1,1,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Yes,1,1,4,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,10,Unknown,127,Unknown,127,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Silver linings were the last thing on Claudia Souser’s mind that tragic day 10 years ago when a Metrolink commuter train collided head-on with a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, killing 25 people, including her husband of 28 years, Doyle.
“Part of me is amazed that it’s been 10 years,” Souser, of Camarillo, a devout Christian and mother of three children, said recently. “It seems like such a long time ago and yet the devastation of his loss is still a really serious thing in our lives.”
As the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 12, 2008, crash approaches on Wednesday, “just seeing the images of the wreckage again on the news, the smoldering ashes of what was your life, it’s been a long time since I faced all that,” she said. “It changed everything forever.”
Twenty-one of the 25 people killed were from Ventura County, including 10 from Simi Valley.
But a decade later, with the pain of the heartbreaking tragedy having healed to some degree, Souser has found a silver lining: rail safety measures, most notably positive train control, that the accident spurred Metrolink and other railroads around the country to implement to try to ensure a repeat of Chatsworth never happens.
“I think that crash certainly made everyone finally wake up and say, ‘What are we doing?’ she said. “And positive train control is one positive thing for safety that has come from this tragedy.”
“People are so very aware of it now,” she said. “And we certainly want to encourage positive train control and whatever it will take to get people to hopefully not have to live through these kinds of things again.”
Officials say positive train control, which uses GPS, radio and computers to remotely monitor trains, is capable of preventing train-to-train crashes, overspeed derailments and unauthorized incursion into work zones.
Metrolink officials say it would have prevented the Chatsworth crash, which injured about 135 other passengers.
The 4:22 p.m. accident, one of the worst in U.S. railroad history, occurred when Metrolink commuter train 111, traveling from Chatsworth to Simi Valley on the Ventura County line, collided head-on with a Union Pacific freight train traveling in the opposite direction near Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Chatsworth. Both trains were going about 42 mph at the time of impact.
The Metrolink train was operated by Connex Railroad LLC, a subsidiary of French conglomerate Veolia.
A National Transportation Safety Board investigation concluded in January 2010 that the crash was caused by the commuter train’s engineer, Robert Sanchez, who was distracted while sending text messages and ran a red light. Sanchez was one of those killed.
Former Metrolink board Chairman Keith Millhouse agrees improved safety measures are the one good thing to come out of the crash.
“It’s such a bittersweet feeling, but If there was anything positive to come out of Chatsworth, it was the safety measures that transformed rail safety throughout the United States,” said Millhouse, a former Moorpark City Council member and a nationally recognized rail safety authority.
He was vice chair of the Metrolink board at the time of the accident and became board chair the next year, taking a lead role in the agency implementing various post-crash safety measures.
A law enacted by Congress a month after the accident, the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, mandated that positive train control be installed on the U.S. rail system by the end of 2015. Congress later extended the deadline to the end of 2018.
Positive train control technology had been conceived prior to the Chatsworth crash, but wasn’t implemented on a large scale until after the accident, Millhouse said.
Metrolink was the first to implement it, he said.
By June 2015, positive train control was operational on all the tracks that Metrolink owns, Metrolink spokeswoman Sherita Coffelt said. By 2017, it was operational on Metrolink’s entire 536 route-mile system, which includes tracks it uses that are owned by Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight railroad, she said.
Metrolink operates in Ventura County and five other Southern California counties: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego.
“We led the nation in positive train control and installed it on all of our tracks in 2015,” Coffelt said. “We continued to work to reach interoperability with the BNSF in 2016 and Union Pacific in 2017. So right now, we’re operating positive train control on our entire system.”
Even with the deadline to implement positive train control extended for three years to the end of 2018, not all railroads in the country will make it, Millhouse said.
“They will be given an extension, provided they have made certain progress,” he said.
“But to me, it’s unconscionable that 10 years later, knowing what happened in Chatsworth, and having the law on the books, that people don’t have this system fully operational everywhere,” he said.
Millhouse said positive train control would have prevented a 2015 Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight people and a 2017 Amtrak derailment near DuPont, Washington, that killed three people. The technology at the time was not operational on the tracks where the two deadly accidents occurred, he said.
Justin Jacobs, a spokesman for Union Pacific, said that by the end of this year, positive train control will be installed on all of its required rail lines and made operational on 75 percent of them.
The technology has already been made operational in Ventura County and the rest of California, Jacobs said.
The technology will be made operational on the remaining 25 percent of Union Pacific’s required lines in the middle of the country by the end of 2020 at the latest, he said.
“Union Pacific’s positive train control footprint is the largest of all North American railroads, encompassing more than 17,000 route miles,” the railroad said in a release.
In addition to positive train control, Amtrak spokesman Paul Gonzales said Metrolink has implemented other post-Chatsworth safety measures, as well:
- Installed inward-facing cameras in all 69 locomotives and all 57 cab cars to monitor engineers. Engineers sometimes operate the trains from cab cars.
- Installed outward-facing cameras in the same number of locomotives and cab cars to monitor things outside the train, such as obstacles on the tracks.
- Replaced passenger cars with newer, more collision-absorbent cars built by South Korea’s Hyundai Rotem that use crash energy management technology. All 80 Metrolink passenger cars now have the technology.
- Acquired 12 new locomotives with crash energy management, with 28 more to be bought. These locomotives have different crash energy management than the Hyundai passenger cars.
All told, the safety measures Metrolink has implemented since the Chatsworth crash have cost about $500 million, Gonzales said.
Since the implementation of positive train control, no other Metrolink train vs. train deadly accidents like the one in Chatsworth have occurred, he said.
“The PTC is designed to prevent a repeat of what happened in Chatsworth,” Gonzales said. “If two trains are on the same track going toward each other, the PTC is going to prevent that from occurring.”
But rail safety at Metrolink is more than just positive train control, he said.
“We’ve got a culture of safety here, which is paramount at the agency,” he said. “You have all these new technologies. You have the memory of this horrible crash in Chatsworth that’s really on people’s minds all the time. So, you put all these factors together and they contribute to making the system as safe as it possibly can be.”
Positive train control would not have averted a 2015 crash in Oxnard between a Metrolink train and a truck stuck on the tracks that killed the train’s engineer and injured more than 30 other people, Metrolink officials have said.
That’s because the technology is designed to deter train-to-train collisions, not crashes involving vehicles on the tracks, the officials have said.
Coffelt said the 10th anniversary of the Chatsworth crash “is a time for us all ... to reflect on that incident: why it happened and the lives that were lost and the lives that were changed. And how it changed the attitudes of an agency and an industry toward safety and being proactive in all we can do to ensure a safe operating environment and the safety of our riders.”
“And to reflect on everything we did and continue to do to prevent an incident like that from ever happening again,” she said.
Jacobs expressed similar sentiments, saying Union Pacific’s “thoughts are with the families and communities impacted by this tragedy that occurred 10 years ago. As a company, we gather together to remember the lives lost and in their memory commit to approaching safety with a constant fervor.”
Passengers recently riding the Metrolink train from Chatsworth to Simi Valley said they didn’t particularly have safety concerns in light of the 2008 collision.
“You have to put things into perspective,” said David Casian, of Simi Valley, who takes the train for his inspector job in Los Angeles. “The number of car accidents we have, airplanes crash, things happen.
“How often do we hear about train crashes?” he said. “Not that often. They’re fairly infrequent. So I feel that rail is a fairly safe method of travel.”
John Haran, 54, also of Simi Valley, agrees.
“There was a thorough investigation that showed operator error and it seems that Metrolink has rectified those errors,” said Haran, who takes the train for his job as industrial safety trainer.
Carlos Romero, 38, of Moorpark, takes the train to his construction job.
“For the most part, riding the train is as safe as any kind of transportation.” he said. “If it’s meant to happen, its meant to happen, you know? That’s how I see it.”
Souser said she hopes the various safety measures the rail industry is implementing accomplish their goal.
“I would just like to turn the news on and not continue to see more train derailments, more train crashes,” she said. “I’d like to see this whole thing get resolved. We have the technology to resolve it. Now we need to do it.”
She plans to attend two memorial events that will be held on Wednesday.
The first is being hosted by Metrolink at 10 a.m. at Union Station’s North Patio in downtown Los Angeles, 800 N. Alameda St. It is not open to the public, only invited survivors of the crash, families of survivors and the deceased, elected officials and Metrolink employees.
But starting at noon that day, the public can attend, free of charge, an exhibit at Union Station that tells the story of the Chatsworth crash and the safety measures it spawned. The exhibit will run until Sept. 26.
Another memorial event will be held in Chatsworth at 3:30 p.m. at Ride On Therapeutic Horsemanship, 10860 Topanga Canyon Blvd. It’s being hosted by Los Angeles City Council member Mitch Englander, who represents Chatsworth. That event will be open to the public.

Raymond Conklin, a survivor of the Sept. 12, 2008, deadly Metrolink crash in Chatsworth, will discuss “what really happened” in an appearance on the 10th anniversary of the disaster.
Conklin, who has written a self-published book about the tragedy, “The Railroaded,” will appear at the Simi Valley Metrolink station, 5050 E. Los Angeles Ave., at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday.
More Metrolink crash news:
“I’m going to talk about what really happened,” said Conklin, 66, of Simi Valley. “I’m going to spill the beans.”
Twenty-five people, including 21 from Ventura County, were killed when a Metrolink commuter train traveling to Simi Valley collided head-on with a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth. Ten of the deceased were from Simi Valley,
About 135 other people were injured, including Conklin, who said he was in the first passenger car behind the Metrolink engine at the time of the crash.
A National Transportation Safety Board investigation concluded in January 2010 that the collision was caused by the commuter train’s engineer, Robert Sanchez, who was distracted while sending text messages and ran a red light. Sanchez was one of those killed.
Conklin’s appearance is not an official Simi Valley event to commemorate the crash, although he needed to obtain a permit from the city to stage it.",Metrolink,Union Pacific,Unknown,Unknown,09/12/2008,Unknown,Simi Valley Metrolink station,Ventura County,CA,Unknown,Simi Valley,Unknown,B,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,0,Unknown,No,21,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Raymond Conklin,Unknown,Unknown

Metro - Los Angeles Times,"Man struck by train after 11 minutes unconscious on the tracks sues L.A. Metro
- Share via
A Los Angeles County man who spent nearly 11 minutes unconscious on a stretch of track in Boyle Heights before being struck by a Gold Line train has sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, alleging that his life-altering injuries were preventable.
While waiting for a train at the Soto station in May, Patrick Chammas, 30, fell off the platform, struck his head, landed on the tracks and lost consciousness, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Chammas spent 11 minutes lying unconscious on the tracks, apparently unnoticed, before a train pulled into the station and ran over him, his attorney said.
“A human being should not be able to be on the tracks unnoticed for almost 11 minutes in a modern subway station,” said Matthew McNicholas, Chammas’ attorney. “It’s an entirely preventable accident, and it never should have happened.”
Both of Chammas’ legs were amputated, and he will face “costs in the multimillions” for prosthetic limbs, McNicholas said. Chammas also received a brain injury that “changed his life’s course,” he said.
Metro spokesman Jose Ubaldo said the agency would not comment on pending litigation.
Chammas was wearing light-colored clothing when he fell, and landed perpendicular to the tracks.
“It’s possible that your eye could play a trick and not see anything on the tracks if he were lying parallel to the tracks,” McNicholas said. “But he was perpendicular to the tracks, in an area that’s lit in the station.”
McNicholas said that footage from the camera inside the train’s cab shows the operator rolling his head on his shoulders in the moments before the collision, as if to stretch or shake off fatigue.
The train stopped about 50 feet beyond Chammas’ body, McNicholas said. The operator could have prevented the accident if he had started braking one or two seconds earlier, he said.
The Gold Line Soto station does not have a barrier to separate the platform from the tracks, which would prevent passengers from falling. That design constitutes a dangerous condition that the agency should have fixed years ago, the lawsuit said.
Metro apparently did not have technology in use to alert officials when someone stepped or fell onto the tracks, McNicholas said.
“There’s no monitoring of incursion on the tracks, and there’s no monitoring of the tracks themselves, and you’ve got an operator who may not have been paying attention,” McNicholas said. “This was almost a conspiracy of horrible factors that had to align.”

She is referring to what has happened since.
""You know, you never think, 'I'm going to be a widow,"" Souser said.
""I'm going to live my life alone and I'm going to raise my kids alone … It's certainly a journey we didn't think we would ever have,"" she said.
That's because Doyle died that September day, along with 24 others, when Train 111 barreled through the Chatsworth area of LA, where it slammed head-on into a freight train.
Along with the dead, 135 people were injured.
It was later determined that the train's engineer was texting on his cell phone and failed to stop at a signal.
Local
The latest news from around North Texas.
Souser believes that if her husband's train had been equipped with a computerized safety system – the same system still absent on North Texas' Trinity Railway Express line – her husband would be alive today.
""…there wouldn't have been a crash,"" she told NBC 5 Investigates in an interview at her home near Los Angeles.
As we reported last month, the TRE, which moves an estimated 8,000 passengers daily between Fort Worth and Dallas, is behind schedule to install the ""positive train control"" safety equipment, also known as PTC, which is now required by the Federal Railroad Administration.
In fact, it is so far behind, the line is in danger of breaking a deadline set by the FRA, which could then shut the Dallas/Fort Worth commuter line down, officials have said.
PTC is a computerized system that monitors train speeds, sends alerts of potential trouble, and can actually take over and stop a train when necessary.
Its purpose, experts say, is to save lives.
While other, much larger commuter lines in the country are well along in implementing PTC, the Trinity Railway Express had the equipment installed on only three of its 17 trains, and none of the required equipment was on its tracks, when NBC 5 Investigates first reported the story in June.
But in an interview, Reed Lanham, the TRE's vice president of technology, said he was not worried by the delay, and does not feel the absence of the safety equipment is placing passengers at greater risks.
""Well, um, I would not think so. Again, we have not on the TRE had an incident that"" PTC computers could have prevented, Lanham said.
Fort Worth-based Trinity Metro, which runs the TRE, says it has struggled to find funding and contractors, and plans to ask the federal government for a two-year extension of the deadline.
But in Los Angeles, the positive train control system is already up and running on the city's much larger commuter railway – progress pushed along after the crash that killed Doyle Souser.
It was one of the deadliest train accidents in U.S. history.
Reeling from the accident, the city set out to install the positive train control apparatus, a massive, $200 million system that monitors 500 miles of track from a high-tech command center.
NBC 5 Investigates went to see.
""There was a great deal of skepticism and some just didn't like the idea of PTC because of the cost,"" said Art Leahy, chief executive officer of Metrolink. ""But we were determined to do it because of the consequences of not having it,"" Leahy said.
Asked whether the computerized control system is making a difference, he said, ""One-hundred percent. We haven't had any close calls with PTC in operation.""
Knowing the loss caused by a bad train accident, Souser said she is surprised the safety system isn't already on track at the Trinity River Express, as well as at some other commuter lines across the country.
""It's the right thing to do, and it should be done..."" she said, adding, ""Why are you waiting?""
A Trinity Metro spokesperson told NBC 5 Investigates their CEO and board president were unavailable for comment.
They sent a statement saying ""the TRE is committed to the safety of its patrons and operates today with a critical safety system in place. The TRE will continue to work toward full PTC implementation to enhance this safety system.""
They hope to have PTC in place sometime next year.
Trinity Metro is also building a new billion-dollar rail line connecting Downtown Fort Worth to DFW Airport -- it's scheduled to open in January. But the agency said that new line won't have PTC fully implemented until the end of 2020.",Metrolink,Metrolink,Metrolink,Unknown,2008,Unknown,Los Angeles,L.A.

As the criminal case against a truck driver involved in a 2015 Oxnard train crash inches forward, about 40 civil suits stemming from the deadly incident hang in the balance.
Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, 57, has been named in both types of litigation related to the Feb. 24, 2015, crash at Fifth Street and Rice Avenue that killed engineer Glenn Steele, 62, and injured dozens of passengers and crew members.
In February 2016, Sanchez Ramirez, was charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter in connection with the crash. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge.
The first of the civil complaints against him, however, were filed within weeks of the incident. In the years that have followed about 40 lawsuits naming defendants such as Sanchez Ramirez, the manufacturer of the rail cars and Metrolink's governing board were filed in both Los Angeles and Ventura county superior courts.
According to a December 2016 National Transportation Safety Board crash report, Sanchez Ramirez was unfamiliar with the area and ""acutely fatigued"" from being awake for more than 24 hours when he mistakenly drove his truck and the trailer it was towing onto the railroad tracks. Sanchez Ramirez abandoned the truck before the commuter train slammed into the vehicle at 5:44 a.m., causing the train to derail and three of its five cars to flip onto their sides.
Steele, the engineer, was seriously injured and died a week later at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
Gallery: Feb. 24, 2015 deadly Metrolink crash in Oxnard
Steele's family members are among the plaintiffs who have filed civil complaints.
Sanchez Ramirez's attorney in the civil cases did not return messages seeking comment.
The 40 civil suits represent 24 people who were aboard the train and at least a dozen of their family members who were also affected, said Oxnard-based attorney Mark Hiepler. The voluminous litigation was coordinated and sent to Los Angeles County Superior Court in January 2017 to be presided over by Judge Elihu Berle, said Hiepler, who is co-lead counsel on the cases.
On Wednesday, a case status conference was held for yet another related lawsuit, which is in the process of being sent to Los Angeles with the other cases.
Hiepler, whose firm represents nine of the plaintiffs, said discovery has wrapped up in the case and depositions were expected to begin within the next few months.
However, Sanchez Ramirez's deposition is on hold until his criminal case is resolved.
On Thursday, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Mark S. Borrell granted a motion in the case regarding access to certain evidence that is protected by law from becoming public. The court was asked to review the employee personnel file of the Oxnard police officer who was the lead investigator on the Metrolink crash.
The defendant's attorney, Ron Bamieh, filed the motion May 1 and stated there was good cause for the court to look into the file because the Oxnard Police Department took disciplinary action against the officer over a traffic collision report.
Bamieh's motion also stated the Ventura County District Attorney's Office was looking into whether or not to place the officer on a list that would require prosecutors calling the investigator to testify in future cases to disclose to defense attorneys the officer's disciplinary record.
The law protects police disciplinary records from becoming public so it is unclear what may or may not have happened.
Jason Zaragoza, Oxnard's deputy city attorney, opposed the defense's motion in his own filing on May 23. The prosecutor assigned to the case, Senior Deputy District Attorney Scott Hendrickson, sent the court a conditional request to look into the officer's file in case the defense's motion was granted.

At Thursday's hearing, Borrell said there was good cause to look into the file and did so behind closed doors with Zaragoza and Oxnard police Sgt. Daniel Whitmer, who brought the information to the court.
After about 35 minutes, Borrell told the defense and prosecution there was some information to be turned over to discovery, namely a letter sent by the Ventura County District Attorney's Office to the Oxnard Police Department about the officer.
However, the letter had already been turned over to defense counsel, according to the prosecutor.

MOBILE — In the dark of night, three travelers advanced inexorably toward tragedy.
Accompanied by her parents on her first train trip, 11-year-old Andrea Chancey couldn't sleep despite the steady rocking of the Amtrak coach. Aboard the same train after missing a flight, Ken Ivory lounged nearby. Miles away, Willie C. Odom steered a towboat as it pushed barges up a river that was getting foggier by the mile.
A bump. A whoosh. A ball of fire.
Suddenly, those three and more than 200 other people were caught up in what remains the deadliest accident in Amtrak history, the derailment of the Los Angeles-to-Miami Sunset Limited in a south Alabama bayou in 1993. Forty-seven people died and more than 100 others were hurt.
Nearly 25 years later, the survivors remember that night vividly: ""I smell the oil. I see the fire. I hear the screaming,"" said Chancey, now 36.
But many others forgot about the disaster as other tragedies occurred, one after the other, through the years.
Once survivors and victims were plucked out of a river delta so remote it's called ""America's Amazon,"" the National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigation. The agency held a public hearing in Mobile, just miles from the bayou, made multiple recommendations to improve safety, and the world moved on.
The same will no doubt happen in the aftermath of a recent string of three Amtrak accidents that killed a total of six people and injured about 170 others in Washington, Virginia and South Carolina.
But for those who witnessed the horror of people drowning in rail cars at Big Bayou Canot, everything comes rushing back with every Amtrak disaster. It's particularly true for Chancey, whose parents both died in the crash.
Chancey sometimes wonders why she lived when so many others died. Did one of her parents lift her out of the bayou waters before drowning, as news reports at the time said, or did God save her for something special? Or was it simply luck?
Ivory, a Texas oil industry worker who helped save Chancey all those years ago, has a theory.
""She was the chosen one,"" said Ivory of Houston.
The crash
Retired Marine Lt. Col. Geary L. Chancey, a pilot and Vietnam veteran, and wife Mary Jane Chancey, a schoolteacher, adopted Andrea when she was only a few weeks old. Born with severe cerebral palsy, their girl would need assistance the rest of her life; she still uses a wheelchair and has home health-care aides who cook and clean for her.
The family was living in Orange Park, Florida, in 1993 when they boarded Amtrak's Sunset Limited for a trip to visit relatives in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Andrea's wheelchair made boarding more difficult than for other passengers, but she was thrilled about her first train ride.
""I thought it was the coolest thing,"" said Chancey, speaking with The Associated Press in her first interview since the accident.
Their visit to the Gulf Coast done, the Chanceys board the eastbound Sunset Limited toward home at Biloxi, Mississippi, the night of Sept. 21, 1993. The train was running about 30 minutes late because of an air conditioning problem that was repaired in New Orleans.
Around the same time, Willie Odom was piloting the towboat Mauvilla as it pushed six barges away from a wharf in Mobile and up the winding Mobile River. The journey would take the boat northward into the Mobile-Tensaw Delta.
With the landscape shrouded in fog, a confused Odom unknowingly turned off the river into Big Bayou Canot, a narrow, non-navigable waterway that snakes through the delta and is crossed by a railroad bridge that lacked lights. As Odom tried to find a tree to tie up until the fog lifted, records show, a barge struck a bridge support, bending the rail tracks more than one yard out of line just eight minutes before the Amtrak train arrived.
On board the Sunset Limited, Andrea Chancey was trying to doze off as the train click-clacked through the night.
""My dad was sitting in front of my mom and I was sitting next to my mom, and for some reason I couldn't sleep,"" said Chancey. ""I had my head on her belly and she was rubbing me.""
Traveling at 72 mph (116 kph), the lead locomotive reached the bridge and jumped the track at the spot where the rails were bent by the barge collision. The 3,000-horsepower, 240-ton engine flew across the bayou, embedding in about 46 feet of mud on the opposite bank. Two other locomotives followed it into the water, along with a baggage car, a crew dorm car and two passenger coaches.
Chancey remembers tumbling as her double-decker coach, Car No. 34083, sailed off the end of the bridge and into the bayou.
Her mother ""pushed me and I fell and I saw my dad fall and when the water came in it was like, 'Wow,"" she said. ""And everything went black.""
Chancey doesn't recall seeing either of her parents again, possibly because of water rushing into the car and inky darkness — the only light came from burning diesel fuel that spilled from the locomotives. But she does remember a few people who got her out of the wreckage, including Ivory, who had decided to take the train to North Carolina to see his wife only after missing a commercial flight.
Ivory said he was on the upper level of the train getting people out of the bottom level when someone thrust the child above the water that was filling the coach. It was pitch black, the only light coming from burning diesel fuel just yards away.
""Whoever it was was being consumed by the water at that time,"" he recalled. ""I didn't ever get to see who handed her up, but I assumed it was her parents.""
After the crash, Andrea was hospitalized with injuries that included oil inhalation. It was left to relatives to tell her that her parents had died.
Miracle child
The ""miracle child,"" as the media called her, went to live with the family of her mother's older sister in Lancaster, Ohio, until she was 18. Her upkeep was funded partly by a trust fund set up by Amtrak and CSX, which owned the bridge.
After briefly attending Wright State University and a failed marriage, Chancey wound up back on the Mississippi coast in Biloxi, where she lives today in an apartment with an assistance dog. Still in a wheelchair, she has help during daylight hours from home health aides.
Chancey gets news alerts on her phone, and she's always shaken when another passenger train crashes.
""Whenever I see Amtrak has another accident, I call my aunt and I say, 'They did it again. They did it again,'"" she said.
Ivory, who was honored by the Coast Guard with another passenger, Michael Dopheide, for his life-saving efforts that night, also struggled with the aftermath. He wondered both why he survived and why he couldn't save more people. For a while, the smell of diesel fuel took him back to the scene of the crash; he figures his work in oil fields where diesel is abundant helped him tamp down the response.
Odom, the towboat pilot, was named as a defendant in more than 90 lawsuits after the crash but never faced criminal charges. He told investigators he felt a ""bump"" as he was pushing the barges that night but didn't realize what had happened until he heard a ""whoosh"" and saw the glow of fire through the fog. Still near the crash site, the Mauvilla and its crew helped pull people from the water.
Odom did not respond to an interview request. He hasn't worked in the river industry since and has struggled for more than two decades with the guilt and pain of what happened, said brother Morsco Odom — though over time, his anguish has eased a bit.
""The nightmares aren't as bad,"" he said.
Andrea Chancey didn't attend a memorial service held in 2016 to honor victims of the crash, and she's never seen a monument erected at the site of the repaired bridge recalling the disaster.
Despite worsening health problems linked in part to cerebral palsy, Chancey expresses less concern about herself than for Odom, who she doesn't blame for the loss of her parents.
The bayou bridge should have been in better shape to begin with, she said, and Amtrak has had too many accidents in the years since. Willie Odom has suffered enough, Chancey said, particularly considering he helped save 17 people after the crash — including her — using the same towboat that hit the bridge.
""I don't blame him one bit,"" Chancey said.
Ivory, too, holds nothing against Odom. Too much time has passed, he said.
But ever since the crash, Ivory said, he has always checked on airline flights well in advance.

GOODWATER — Goodwater, with fewer than 1,500 residents, is the largest city in Coosa County. It has an unusual-but-quaint downtown strip that curves along Alabama Highway 9 until crossing the bridge over railroad tracks that were once the town's hub.
A beautiful Victorian mansion sits atop a hill overlooking the town. It now houses administration offices of the Goodwater Healthcare Center. The town is also home to a National Guard Armory.
Goodwater was initially named Adkins Gap, according to the Encyclopedia of Alabama. It became ""known as Goodwater because of its location near the spring that is the source of Hatchett Creek.""
In 1874, the Central of Georgia Railroad built its Birmingham to Columbus, Georgia, line through the town. The next year, the town was incorporated.
Goodwater Depot was built in 1887. It had a coal chute that was the only refueling stop along the route, meaning most trains stopped in the town.
""Goodwater also became a shipping center as area farmers and other communities brought goods to be sent throughout the state,"" the Encyclopedia said. ""A number of businesses sprang up to serve the railroad and passengers, and the town had several doctors and dentists.""
Tragedy struck the town in 1891 when a trestle caught fire and was so weakened by the heat that a passing Columbus and Western Railroad train was derailed. Three people died in a fire in the caboose after being trapped inside.
According to a transcription of an 1891 article on gendisasters.com, 12 cars and their occupants fell 60 feet into the creek below. The article said the railroad bridge was over Hatcher's Creek, but it likely meant Hatchett (or Hatchet) Creek. The lengthy article from the Columbus Enquirer said, ""The most disastrous wreck ever known on the Columbus and Western railroad, between this city and Birmingham, occurred at 6:20 o'clock yesterday morning, at Hatcher's creek, ninety miles from Columbus and seventy miles from Birmingham. Those burned alive were: Conductor R. Wylly Rice, Trainman Leon R. Crawford, Thomas McCaffrey, a tramp printer.""
The next day, the rail company's cabooses were draped in mourning, the article said. ""Never was there such a gloom over the railroaders about the Union depot and in the yards. They stood about in groups, speaking of the awful affair, and were greatly depressed.""
As coal fueling was phased out, trains no longer stopped in Goodwater but the historic depot was preserved and now houses the Ruritan club. The building was moved from its spot beside the railroad to a spot along Alabama Highway 9.
Two Goodwater natives who gained fame are:
—Robert Daniel Carmichael (1879-1967) is a mathematician known for his research in the field, including the Carmichael Numbers, which are named for him.
—Jamario Moon, born in 1980, is a professional basketball player who has played for the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Clippers, among others.",Central of Georgia Railroad,Columbus and Western Railroad,Unknown,Unknown,1891,6:20 o'clock,Goodwater Depot,AL,Coosa County,AL,Goodwater,Alabama Highway 9,B,Unknown,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Goodwater,Unknown,Unknown

An Amtrak train on a new rail route derailed off a bridge in Washington state. At least three people were killed
- Share via
After a speeding Amtrak train derailed during its first trip on a new rail line — on the heels of two deadly passenger rail crashes blamed on high speed since 2015 — safety experts on Tuesday asked why the train did not have the latest automated control system.
The train was traveling 80 mph in a 30-mph zone on a newly opened $181-million segment of track south of Seattle, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Train cars spilled onto busy Interstate 5 and killed three train passengers.
The new 14.5-mile bypass, developed by the local government agency Sound Transit, was designed to allow the train to travel at faster speeds by avoiding cargo traffic.
But the passage was not yet equipped with what is known as a “positive train control system.” Such systems automatically slow down trains when they are approaching curves too quickly or headed toward a collision with another train.
Sound Transit is working to install the complex electronic system, having outfitted the majority of the equipment on its tracks and trains, but does not expect the automatic system to be operational until the second quarter of 2018, said spokesman Geoff Patrick.
When everything else goes wrong, the positive train control is supposed to intervene. Investigators said the lack of such a system contributed to eight deaths in an Amtrak accident in 2015 and a single fatality in a New Jersey Transit crash in 2016.
“Why they didn’t have positive train control is a question in my mind,” said Michael McGinley, a railroad safety expert and track engineer. “Why wouldn’t they build a new system with the latest technology?”
The simple answer is that U.S. railroads and their government regulators have been slow to implement the tricky system, leaving the majority of trains unprotected. McGinley noted that the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission, among other federal agencies, took more than a year to coordinate their rules for the system.
Much of the freight railroad industry fought the regulations, arguing it was not economical. And when the companies were finally ordered to adopt the technology, suppliers were backed up to design and produce the custom systems.
“I think it should make people very angry,” Keith Millhouse, the former board chairman for Southern California’s Metrolink commuter rail system, said of the lack of positive train control on the Washington track. Metrolink installed positive train control after the 2008 Chatsworth train disaster, which was caused by a texting Metrolink engineer.
Congress had originally given the nation’s rail services until 2015 to finish installing positive train control systems on their lines. But that deadline was extended until the end of 2018 as rail officials complained about the technical challenges of implementing the safeguards.
To positive train control advocates such as Millhouse, that delay has been deadly.
“It was clear that train could not handle that curve going 80 miles an hour,” Millhouse said of Monday’s Amtrak crash. “Given the fact positive train control was mandated in the Rail Safety Act of 2008, the delays in getting it implemented around the country are really inexcusable, and it’s cost people their lives.”
Patrick, the Sound Transit spokesman, said installation of the positive train control was not behind schedule and that the agency always intended to have it operational some months after the service began. He noted that other segments of the Amtrak rail system between Seattle and Portland, Ore., also do not have operational systems.
NTSB officials gathered the speed data from the rear engine of the 14-car train, which appears to be the only car that did not derail on a bridge over Interstate 5. About five crew members and 80 passengers were on board.
However, it’s “too early to tell” why the train was traveling so fast in a slow zone, NTSB member Bella Dinh-Zarr said at a Monday night news conference, as federal investigators began arriving at the scene of the crash.
She did not say whether investigators believed speed was the cause of the derailment and added that the train crew had not been interviewed yet.
“We will be looking at all the different areas of this accident” to look for possible factors leading to the crash, Dinh-Zarr said. “We don’t have a great deal of information to report.”
Typically, train engineers are supplied with “employee timetables” that include speed limits on every inch of the track they will go over.
About one mile before a speed-restricted curve, signs are posted notifying the engineer of a speed change. And engineers are required to be “territory qualified” and familiar with their route, particularly on an inaugural journey like the one the Amtrak train was taking, said McGinley, a railroad safety expert and track engineer.
The Amtrak’s front locomotive was reportedly carrying two engineers when it crashed, not the typical single train operator used on most trains. The presence of two engineers will probably be examined by investigators.
“Whether they were distracted when they passed the speed sign, we don’t know,” said Steven Ditmeyer, a retired research and development chief at the Federal Railroad Administration.
Monday’s crash seems to share some similarities with a 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia, which derailed after a distracted engineer entered a curve too quickly. At a 2016 meeting announcing the board’s findings of the Philadelphia crash’s causes, NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart said positive train control would have stopped “this entirely preventable tragedy.”
“Unless positive train control is implemented soon, I’m very concerned that we’re going to be back in this room again, hearing investigators detail how technology that we have recommended for more than 45 years could have prevented yet another fatal rail accident,” Hart said at the May 17, 2016, meeting.
The three dead on the train included two rail aficionados, Zack Willhoite and Jim Hamre, who were on board for the inaugural journey.
Willhoite worked as an IT customer service support specialist for Pierce Transit, a Pierce County transit agency.
“Behind the scenes he was a writer and advocate for better transit for all,” tweeted Pierce Transit board member Chris Karnes, a crash survivor, who said Willhoite had also helped the board with IT issues. “He will be missed.”
Hamre was a board member for the Rail Passengers Assn., a transit advocacy group, and he formerly worked at the Washington State Department of Transportation.
“Jim combined personability and kindness, and paired it with an intricate and detailed knowledge of transit policy and technical insight,” the association said in a statement. “This made him an extremely powerful advocate and an inspiration for others.” Willhoite was also a member of the association.
Tuesday was expected to be the first full day on the scene for NTSB investigators. Dinh-Zarr, the board member, said investigators were often on scene for seven to 10 days. It’s common for reports issuing probable-cause findings for the reasons for crashes to take a year or longer.
“Our mission is not just to understand what happened, but why it happened, and to recommend changes so we can prevent another tragedy from happening again,” Dinh-Zarr said, noting that the NTSB has recommended the implementation of positive train control for years.
Millhouse, the former Metrolink chairman, urged swifter action.
“The NTSB report will be very exhaustive but will take a year or 18 months to come out,” Millhouse said. “In the interim, the people of Washington and Oregon just can’t sit back and cross their fingers and hope nothing happens again. They have to be proactive now and take measures with their system.”

The NTSB said the train that derailed south of Seattle on Monday was traveling 80 miles per hour, 50 miles faster than the speed limit on the curve where it crashed.
Early indications suggest a train that derailed Monday morning near Dupont, Washington, killing several people, was traveling about 50 miles over the speed limit on the stretch of track where it crashed. If that proves correct, it will be the latest example of delayed implementation of a safety failsafe in the United States leading to a fatal train wreck.
The Amtrak Cascades train was traveling from Seattle to Portland, traveling a brand-new, faster route, when it jumped the rails south of Tacoma, sending cars careening off the tracks and off an overpass over Interstate 5, where it struck several vehicles. There’s still no confirmed death toll from the wreck. But the National Transportation Safety Board said late Monday night that the train was traveling 80 miles per hour, close to the 79 mph limit on the run, citing the train’s data recorder. The train was supposed to slow to 30 miles per hour as it curved over the highway.
Amtrak argued that any such judgments are too hasty. “It’s being investigated by the NTSB and anything beyond that, until their findings are out, is pure speculation,” Gary Banks Olson, assistant superintendent of operations, told the Seattle Times.
But while it is true that the NTSB’s full investigation will probably take months to complete, the cause of a wreck is often quickly clear from the data recorder, which is similar to those used in airplanes. Train-safety experts who examined photos and footage of the crash said that the arrangement of the cars—including the direction of one locomotive that left the tracks, and jackknifed cars on the overpass—suggested the train had been moving too fast headed into the curve. (The train had locomotives at both ends, a common configuration.)
Amtrak said Monday that Positive Train Control, a technological failsafe intended to avoid collisions, excessive speed, and other human errors, was installed on the stretch of track where the train derailed but was not in effect and was still in testing.
Mechanical and equipment failures are more common causes of train wrecks than human error, but human error often plays a role in the most spectacular crashes. In May 2015, Amtrak 188 derailed in Philadelphia, killing eight people. The NTSB concluded that the engineer had been distracted by radio traffic and failed to slow down headed into a curve. In 2016, a New Jersey Transit train going too fast crashed at Hoboken Terminal. In 2008, a Metrolink train collided with a freight train in Los Angeles, killing 25, an accident NTSB said was caused by its engineer texting and missing signals.
Each of these cases would likely have been preventable with PTC, which acts somewhat like an autopilot on a train. If an engineer fails to slow down to speed limits, or blows through a signal, the system will override the manual controls and slow the train down.
The 2008 crash led Congress to mandate that PTC be in place on all passenger, commuter, and hazardous-materials trains by the end of 2015. Railroads warned that they would be forced to halt service on January 1, 2016, if an extension was not granted. Toward the end of 2015, with railroads complaining they could not roll the system out fast enough, Congress extended its deadline to 2018. Amtrak, which is perpetually strapped for cash, has struggled to pay for the installation of the system.
Yet horrifying and fatal crashes continue to pile up in the absence of PTC. In the curve where Amtrak 188 crashed in Philadelphia in 2015, PTC was in place on the southbound side of the track but not the northbound side. NJ Transit had received a waiver excusing it from installing PTC at the Hoboken stretch where the 2016 crash occurred. Now comes the Washington state case, where PTC was installed but not yet in place.
“If a PTC system has been active, this train might not have derailed,” then-NTSB Chair Christopher Hart said when the board completed its investigation of Amtrak 188. “Close to 200 passengers would not have been injured and eight other passengers would still be alive today.”
Even if PTC would have prevented Monday’s derailment, that leaves many questions about why the train was overspeed. For example, was the train moving too fast because of an equipment problem, or because the engineer didn’t try to slow down? If the latter, what happened? Was the engineer distracted, whether by a phone or something else? Could the engineer have blacked out or had a health problem?
Richard Beall, a longtime train-wreck investigator, told me railroads ought to have more than one person in the cab of a train, especially in the absence of PTC. “If this guy had a brain fart and didn’t realize where he was and, oh crap, I’ve got a 20 or 30 mph curve coming up, that’s why you have another pair of eyes up there to help you with that stuff,” Beall said.
Because Monday’s voyage was the first run with passengers on the new line, the safety preparations and training ahead of the launch will come in for scrutiny, with questions about whether the engineer’s unfamiliarity with the route might have contributed to speeding through the curve.
The Washington State Department of Transportation said that the tracks would be inspected in January 2017, with dry runs using the actual trains starting in February. But it’s not clear how many test runs the train made, what the staffing was, or when that testing concluded, which might shed some light on how familiar the crew was with their route.
“What troubles me here is this is a startup operation,” Beall said. “Usually if you have a startup operation you’re running the equipment daily for months with no one on it to get the crews familiarized with all the lines.”
There were 78 passengers and five crewmembers on board, according to Amtrak. Around 77 people were hospitalized after the crash, including some people injured when the train fell off the overpass onto busy I-5. But officials have not yet released a solid number for those killed, citing confusion at the scene, multiple responding agencies, and the difficulty of inspecting all parts of a dangerous scene.",Amtrak,Unknown,Washington State Department of Transportation,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Tacoma,Washington,Washington,WA,Unknown,I-5,B,80,2,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,83,Unknown,78,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,John Doe,Unknown,Unknown

It took about a day longer than hoped, but crews had carted off the biggest chunk by the afternoon: the 270,000-pound locomotive involved in the Monday morning rush-hour crash in the city of Dupont, which killed three train passengers and sent about 100 people to hospitals.
But the biggest chunk still remained: the 270,000-pound locomotive involved in the Monday morning rush-hour crash in the city of Dupont, which killed three train passengers and sent about 100 people to hospitals.
The affected southbound stretch of Interstate 5 will remain closed indefinitely, the Washington State Department of Transportation has said.
""Even once the locomotive is removed we will need to clear debris,"" the department said in a statement on Wednesday. The roadway may also need repairs, the agency said.
The train was travelling 80 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone, when it careened off an overpass onto the highway below, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
NTSB member Bella Dinh-Zarr confirmed during a Tuesday evening press conference that the Amtrak Cascades 501 train, which was carrying 83 people when it derailed Monday, had not been outfitted with ""positive train control.""
""Positive train control"" is an overlay system designed to stop train derailment, collisions and speeding accidents by enforcing speed control.
Congress mandated all major rail lines be outfitted with PCT in 2008, after two trains in Los Angeles collided head-on, NBCNews reported. The original deadline was the end of 2015, but Congress extended implementation until the end of 2-18, due to the up to $22.5 billion price tag and the complication.
""Could that speed control have made a difference? We don't know that for sure,"" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said during a conference.
""None of us, including myself, should be making conclusions about the causes of this accident at the moment,"" he added.
Dinh-Zarr, meanwhile, emphasized the NTSB will not release a cause of crash at least until completion of the on-site investigation. She did, however, detail some findings.
Dinh-Zarr said the train's emergency brake had not been activated by the train's engineer, but was automatically activated during the accident. At the time of the accident, the engineer was not alone in the cab. A conductor familiarizing himself with the territory accompanied the engineer, while the train's conductor was intermingling with passengers.
""Distraction is one of our most wanted on our list of priorities. It is protocol to look at all cell records of all crew members,"" Dinh-Zarr said.
NTSB and the lead investigator plan to thoroughly interview all crew members once they are medically fit. In the coming days, NTSB will continue to collect information from data recorders, as well as two on-train cameras that have sustained heavy damage.
The on-site investigation could last another seven to 10 days, after which point NTSB will likely still need more time before determining the cause of the crash.
The derailment placed Amtrak, the country's main passenger rail service, under renewed scrutiny following a series of fatal incidents.
At least two of the three people killed in the derailment were transit enthusiasts who wanted to ride the inaugural run along the new route. A medical examiner is still trying to identify the third victim through fingerprints, the Washington State Patrol said on Wednesday.

Reporting from DuPont, Wash. — About 6 a.m. Monday, the Amtrak Cascades Train 501 rolled out of Seattle for an inaugural trip: the first run with passengers on a new rail line promising faster trips to Portland, at faster-than-freeway speeds.
“Wow this train is fast,” tweeted Chris Karnes, the chairman of Pierce County’s transit advisory board, as the train sped through the morning darkness with seven crew members and 77 passengers aboard. “Once you leave downtown Tacoma it’s 79 mph to Portland. We are passing up traffic on I-5.”
Then, about 40 miles south of Seattle, some passengers heard creaking and began to feel the cars rock. The train was derailing. Thirteen of the 14 cars leapt from their tracks near a bridge over Interstate 5, with some plummeting toward the rush-hour traffic below.
“I was sleeping,” said one passenger, Charles Karr of Portland. “Then I was flying through the air. None of us could believe what was happening.”
Train cars collided with five automobiles and two semi-trucks, injuring some of the drivers. Inside the train, passengers were thrown from their seats as the cabin lights flickered out. At least one train car came to rest upside down, while two others dangled from the overpass.
After the mayhem ended, at least three train occupants were dead and an untold number were injured. Train cars laid scattered around the tracks like spilled timber as concerned freeway drivers came to a halt. The survivors were left to crawl out of darkened compartments or to break through windows to escape, some with cuts, bruises and broken bones.
Officials had no immediate explanation for the derailment, which will now be the focus of an intensive National Transportation Safety Board investigation.
“Amtrak 501, emergency, emergency, emergency, we are on the ground,” a crew member said in a publicly available call to 911 immediately after the crash.
“Hey, guys, what happened?” the dispatcher said.
“We were coming around the corner to take the bridge over I-5 right north of Nisqually and we went on the ground.”
“OK. Is everybody OK?”
“I’m still figuring that out,” the crew member said. “We’ve got cars everywhere and down onto the highway.”
When asked for the mile post location of the train’s crash, the crew member gave an estimate, and then added, “As soon as I know exactly where all my train is, I’ll let you know.”
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee called the derailment tragic and declared a state of emergency in in Pierce and Thurston counties. President Trump’s first public response was to use the incident to push for Congress to support a long-promised infrastructure plan that has not yet materialized.
“The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly,” Trump tweeted. “Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!”
Shortly later, the president added: “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont, Washington. Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene. We are currently monitoring here at the White House.”
Along with many other factors, including train speed, investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are likely to examine the work done on the new, $181-million bypass Monday where the train derailed. It was designed to speed travel times by separating passenger trains and freight traffic south of Tacoma.
The Amtrak Cascades train service is jointly owned by the states of Washington and Oregon, with operation of the trains contracted to Amtrak. Before the new tracks opened, Amtrak trains shared a curving route along the Puget Sound coastline with nearly 50 freight trains a day.
The new 14.5-mile bypass route, owned by Sound Transit, had previously served military and cargo transit but was upgraded to higher-speed passenger service with the help of funds from the Federal Railroad Administration, which monitored some of the work, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation.
The department said that the tracks had undergone weeks of inspection and testing before opening to passengers Monday.
“Today is the first day these tracks were used,” Pierce County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Ed Troyer said during a televised news conference. “This would have been first trip, first train, first day.”
The precariousness of the disaster scene also meant the temporary shutdown of Interstate 5, a major artery. Officials had to make sure the derailed cars were stable enough to board before they could check for more casualties. None of the dead were identified on Monday night, and officials didn’t give an estimate on the number of injured.
“We will do everything in our power to support these passengers, our employees and their families,” Amtrak said in a statement. “At this time, we will not speculate about the cause, and we encourage others not to speculate as well.”
People involved in the accident gathered at DuPont City Hall, with memories of the derailment still fresh.
Karr, the rider from Portland, recalled seeing a person who’d been thrown from the train. “I think he was OK, though,” Karr said. “He was gone when I got out there.”
Passenger Anthony Raimondi said the train began tipping, then “everything went dark and stuff was flying around.” He kicked out a window to escape.
A young woman who gave her name as Lindy said, “This isn’t my first train ride, but it might be my last.”

In CA, high-speed rail partisans eye Washington crash
Although it might be regarded as an opportunity to score points against Gov. Jerry Brown’s beloved high-speed rail project, the train crash that killed at least three people Monday is drawing a muted response from both opponents and boosters – at least for the time being.
Amtrak Cascades Train 501, on its way from Seattle to Portland, Oregon, derailed southwest of Tacoma, and sent rail cars off a bridge onto the highway below. It was the maiden journey of a rail link that, if not quite a bullet train, was designed to provide fast travel times between the two major northwestern cities. The train was reportedly going 80 miles per hour when the accident occurred.
In an email to Capitol Weekly, Aaron Fukuda, co-chair of anti-bullet-train Citizens for California High-Speed Rail Accountability, said:
“At this point the cause of this tragedy is unknown. I think it is best for our group to not provide a comment as we don’t want to utilize it for any efforts here in California when people lost loved ones and/or are standing by those they love as they struggle with injuries.”
Fukuda’s group has been caustic in earlier comments on the safety of passengers aboard the bullet train, however, declaring on its website:
“The California High-Speed Rail Authority will need to adopt comprehensive passenger security procedures and provide costly protection for the rail itself in urban, suburban, and rural environments. Future governors will surely place a priority on continually evaluating vulnerabilities and threats, and the state Legislature will have endless challenges getting funding for programs to protect the high-speed rail system from terrorist attacks, pranksters, fools, and suicides. Expect these programs to include unionized government employees and expensive technology, including drones.”
Annie Parker, spokeswoman for the California High-Speed Rail Authority, cited a number of built-in safety features, including Positive Train Control (PTC).
“Through PTC, train engineers receive continuous information about speed restrictions, work zones and other safety impacts. For example, the PTC system would alert an engineer approaching a crossing where the crossing arms are malfunctioning,” the Authority’s website says.
“With PTC, a train’s onboard computer displays safe-breaking distance based on speed, train length, weight and track curvature.
“PTC also restricts speed limits and serves as a failsafe system. If the engineer doesn’t respond, the PTC system takes over, thus preventing a train from running a red signal light or entering a stretch of track at an unsafe speed.”
PTC was not operating on Amtrak Cascades Train 501, but it would probably have prevented the accident if it had, investigators told reporters.
Amtrak trains are equipped with PTC, but the Washington State Department of Transportation said the necessary track-side sensors to enable it were not yet in place.
Democrats in general have supported fellow Democrat Brown’s project, but support is not unanimous. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, worries about the fiscal viability of the $64 billion project.
Private investment may put the project over the top, Newsom told the Los Angeles Times. “But absent something significant — and I mean, really significant — I can’t see supporting something that would come at such a high cost to other infrastructure,” Newsom said. “I don’t see how we could go forward. There’s got to be a different financing plan. Without it, the math doesn’t add up.”
The two major parties differ on the project. The 2016 California Democratic Party platform gives high-speed rail an endorsement, but it is less than full-throated:
“California Democrats are working to modernize our roads and transportation with strong and workable low-emission, zero-emission vehicle standards and strategies and infrastructure to reduce driving such as promoting smart growth, creating “complete streets,” teaching bicycle traffic skills, and improving transit, from local systems to high speed rail.”(Emphasis added.)
The Republicans are blunt. Their platform simply calls for “Ending federal support for California’s high-speed rail project.”

(WLS) -- A car was struck by a freight train and pushed several blocks after the man behind the wheel drove around the railroad crossing gates in west suburban Melrose Park, investigators said. His female passenger was killed in the crash and identified Friday morning.
Jocelynn Morales, 21, of the 300-block of 22nd Avenue in Bellwood, was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:51 a.m., the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said.
""You never think this is going to happen to you, that your kid is going to be involved in something like an accident,"" said Veronica Morales, Jocelynn's mother.
Up on the wall of the Morales' home is a photo of Jocelynn that captures her signature dimple smile, posing on the train tracks that would ultimately be the last place she was alive.
""Everybody is like 'Yeah, you have to be strong,' but I can't, that was my baby, that was my baby girl,"" Veronica said through tears.
Veronica said her daughter had her whole life ahead of her. Jocelynn was a third year student at Concordia University on a full ride scholarship through Fifth Third Bank's Tomorrow's Promise program. She was studying to be a psychologist.
Fifth Third Bank issued a statement Friday, saying, ""Fifth Third Bank is heart broken to hear of the news. Jocelynn was a bright, loving, incredible young woman. We were so proud to underwrite her college tuition because we knew she was someone who would make a difference in the world.""
""She was always reading or studying for a test, or writing a paper,"" her mother said.
Her family said she was out with friends Thursday night and was on her way home when the car she was in collided with a freight train.
The impact occurred just before 2 a.m. on the border of Melrose Park and Maywood, at the crossing located at Main Street and North 19th Avenue. The Union Pacific freight train pushed the vehicle along the tracks to the area near North 15th and Railroad avenues.
It took more than 40 minutes to extricate Jocelynn from the car. An autopsy has not yet been scheduled.
Only two things were left at the scene late Friday morning: the tattered bumper of a gold Acura and a shredded warning gate.
The driver, identified as 20-year-old Ivan Tabares-Gomez, was pulled from the vehicle by a police officer who arrived first at the scene, Maywood Fire Chief Craig Bronaugh said. He was transported to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, where he is listed in critical condition. No other injuries were reported. Friends said Tabares-Gomez was Jocelynn's best friend.
""You couldn't separate them. Anything in the world, nothing in the world could separate them,"" said Jonathan Duarte, friend.
Family and friends gathered for a vigil Friday night, where Veronica's crippling pain was apparent.
""She told me all the time, 'Mom I am responsible, I know what I'm doing.' I just don't know how this could happen to her,"" she said through tears.
""Earlier today, after we left the hospital, everyone was talking about how the sun came out. We were saying that's her, she's telling us to relax, it's going to be ok,"" said Jasmine Velasquez, cousin. ""We're going to miss her a lot.""
Bronaugh said he hopes this serves as a lesson to others thinking of driving around the crossing gates.
""Under no circumstances do we want anyone, for any reason, to go around the railroad gates. The outcome is usually bad. There are times when the car wins, but the odds are not good. Again, we strongly recommend not doing that,"" Bronaugh said.

The engineer of an Amtrak train that derailed from an overpass onto rush-hour traffic on Interstate 5 in DuPont, Wash., was not on his cellphone at the time of the crash, federal investigators said Friday.
“The crew was not observed to use any personal electronic devices during the time frame reviewed,” the National Traffic Safety Board said after a review of audio and video recordings inside Amtrak Cascades Train 501.
For the record:
8:20 a.m. Dec. 23, 2017An earlier version of this article referred to questions about whether the train’s conductor had been on the phone. Questions involved the engineer.
The train left Seattle early Monday morning on its inaugural run to Portland, Ore., with seven crew members and 77 passengers aboard.
About 40 miles south of Seattle, in DuPont, Wash., 13 of 14 cars derailed near a bridge over Interstate 5 as the train reached speeds of 80 mph in a 30 mph zone. Several cars fell onto the freeway below, striking vehicles in rush-hour traffic. Three passengers on the train were killed and dozens were injured.
Almost immediately, there were questions as to whether the engineer had been on the phone.
It’s common practice for the NTSB to determine whether crew members may have been distracted by personal electronic devices, since it’s happened before. In Los Angeles, for instance, the the agency determined that the engineer of a Metrolink train was distracted by typing text messages on his cellphone when he ran through a red signal in 2008, smashing head-on into a Union Pacific freight train and killing 25 people.
The board’s review of the DuPont crash did not disclose what the crew was doing as the train barreled into a curve headed for a trestle around 7:45 a.m. The train was using a new, faster route that would have shaved 10 minutes off the trip. Track speed was largely around 80 mph, but a sign, visible to train crews before the abrupt curve, limited speed to 30 mph.
The NTSB said the engineer did react — just not in time.
“About six seconds prior to the derailment,” the board said, “the engineer made a comment regarding an over speed condition.” He apparently then tried to brake.
“The engineer’s actions were consistent with the application of the locomotive’s brakes just before the recording ended,” according to the report, but it said “it did not appear the engineer placed the brake handle in emergency-braking mode.”
The report concludes: “The recording ended as the locomotive was tilting and the crew was bracing for impact.”
Federal investigators say they have not yet spoken with all five members of the train crew, as several remain hospitalized. Some train cars in the scattered wreckage flipped and landed upside down while others wound up dangling from the trestle. Only the rear “pusher” locomotive was left standing on the tracks above.
Most passengers and some motorists suffered minor to major injuries, and several remain in critical condition. The three who died — all of them train buffs — have now been identified. Jim Hamre, 61, and his friend Zack Willhoite, 35, both from the Tacoma area, were riding together. They were members of All Aboard Washington, a rail enthusiasts group. Their volunteer efforts helped establish the new, faster route they died on. The third victim, Benjamin Gran, 40, of nearby Auburn, was described by a relative as “an Amtrak fan to the max.”
Many of those injured and families of some of those killed are telling their stories on GoFundMe, the online site that collects crowdfunding donations for those in need.
Bret Tomblin, Willhoite’s brother-in-law, said the Pierce County Transit employee supported his wife and mother.
“The goal of this GoFundMe is to raise money for their mortgage and bills for the next three months so we can prepare for the new normal,” Tomblin said. As of late Friday afternoon, $3,815 of a $10,000 goal had been raised.
A teen boy, meanwhile, is well on the way to his goal. The 16-year-old identified only as Timmy suffered a compressed spinal cord and other injuries in the crash, and has undergone several surgeries. More than $37,000 of a $50,000 target has been donated, his page said Friday.
Donors have given Aaron Harris, seriously injured in the crash, well beyond his requested sum: As of Friday, over $32,000 of a $4,545 goal had been pledged in his name. A family friend said all the money would go toward his recovery and to aid his family.
Amtrak has also announced that it will cover medical expenses and other costs incurred by passengers injured or killed in the crash. The rail line and the NTSB say it will likely take a year or more for the government to complete its crash investigation and compile a report.

The truck driver had been on duty for nearly 24 hours, including nearly 17 hours traveling from Somerton, Arizona, to a work site in Oxnard, California, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's final report on the accident.
The 5:44 a.m. crash on Feb. 24, 2015, also injured 32 Metrolink passengers and train crew members.
Earlier this year, Ventura County prosecutors filed a misdemeanor charge of vehicular manslaughter against the truck driver, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, a farm equipment repairman from Yuma, Arizona.
His attorney has said Sanchez-Ramirez made repeated attempts to get the vehicle off the rails, then ran for his life as the train approached out of fear that fuel he used to power tools might cause an explosion.
The truck driver had gone on duty in Somerton on Feb. 23 at 5:51 a.m. and began his trip to Oxnard at 1 p.m., using written directions and a cellphone navigation application for what was estimated to be a six-hour, 350-mile trip, the NTSB said.
Radiator damage that required getting a replacement truck caused a 4 1/2-hour delay in Jacumba, California, and another delay occurred when the truck was sideswiped by another vehicle in Los Angeles around 1:30 a.m. on Feb. 24.
The accident occurred 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles in an area where commercial and residential developments abruptly give way to agricultural fields.
Sanchez-Ramirez was heading south down an avenue intending to turn at the next intersection. But he mistakenly made a right turn onto tracks 57 feet north of the cross-street. The rail crossing was marked with signals and gates, although they were not activated because the train was not yet approaching.
The NTSB report said that at the time the navigation application did not include information on rail crossings. If it had, the driver ""would have been less likely to misinterpret the visual cues and mistakenly turn"" onto the tracks while approaching the intersection, the report said.
The report said that various companies have agreed to incorporate such data from the Federal Railroad Administration into mapping and navigation applications, although timelines for doing so are uncertain.
The Federal Railroad Administration informed the NTSB last June that it was reviewing its information on crossings for accuracy and expected to have it ready for integration by the end of the year, the report noted.
The truck traveled about 80 feet down the tracks before it became stuck. The NTSB report said that at some point the driver got out, attempted to push the truck off the track and tried to call 911 but failed because he was in a panic. The truck was left with its headlights and hazard lights on and a door open.
Analysis of GPS data from the driver's cellphone found that about 12 minutes elapsed between the time the truck got stuck and the train hit it, the report said.
The train, crewed by an engineer, student engineer and conductor was carrying 51 passengers on an early weekday run east to Los Angeles. The student engineer at the controls spotted the obstruction about a quarter-mile from the crossing and the crash occurred 8 seconds after he began emergency braking.
The NTSB said a test showed the truck was visible from a distance of more than a half-mile but the headlights of approaching highway traffic converged with the truck's lights. This ""masking"" might have made it difficult for the student engineer to comprehend the hazard, the report said.
The cab car a passenger carriage with operator controls at the front and three coach cars derailed while the locomotive at the rear stayed on the tracks.

A truck driver was acutely fatigued from being awake for more than 24 hours when he mistakenly drove onto railroad tracks in Oxnard last year, causing a deadly collision with a Metrolink commuter train, the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday in its final report on the crash.
Another factor that led the driver, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, to go onto the tracks in the early morning hours of Feb. 24, 2015, was his unfamiliarity with the area, the 23-page report said. Sanchez-Ramirez is from Yuma, Arizona.
He said he intended to turn from South Rice Avenue onto Fifth Street but instead turned onto the tracks, which are 57 feet before Fifth Street, according to the report.
His truck, which was towing a trailer, got stuck on the rails and was abandoned by Sanchez-Ramirez before the train slammed into it at 5:44 a.m., derailing and flipping three of its five cars onto their sides. The crash occurred 12 minutes after Sanchez-Ramirez turned onto the tracks, the report said. He suffered minor injuries unrelated to the crash.
Thirty-three passengers and crew members were injured in the crash, including engineer Glenn Steele, 62, who died a week later.
Sanchez-Ramirez, 56, was charged in February with one count of vehicular manslaughter, a misdemeanor. He faces up to one year in county jail if convicted. His arraignment in Ventura County Superior Court has been postponed numerous times and is now scheduled for Jan. 11. Sanchez-Ramirez remains free from custody.
The NTSB led the investigation into the crash. Its investigators reviewed data recorders, video, records from several agencies, on-site inspections and interviewed those involved, from passengers and crew to first-responders. But they didn't interview Sanchez-Ramirez, who declined to talk to them, the report said.
According to the report, by the time Sanchez-Ramirez turned onto the tracks, he had spent 16.75 hours driving from Arizona - a trip that was extended by a mechanical breakdown and a minor collision with another vehicle — and had been on duty for almost 24 hours. Sanchez-Ramirez had expected the 350-mile trip to take only six hours, the report said.
""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the Oxnard, Calif. crash was the trunk driver mistakenly turning onto the railroad right-of-way due to acute fatigue ... from being awake for more than 24 hours ... and unfamiliarity with the area,"" the report stated.
""Sleep deprivation and lack of adequate sleep have been shown to result in decreases in alertness, lapses in attention, driver error and increased crash risk,"" the report said.
Sanchez-Ramirez's Ventura-based criminal defense attorney, Ron Bamieh, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The report details Sanchez-Ramirez's activities in the roughly 24-hour period preceding the crash:
Monday, Feb. 23, 2015
- 5:51 a.m. - Sanchez-Ramirez reports for duty in Somerton, Arizona.
- 1 p.m. - He begins driving to Oxnard.
- 4:27 p.m. - He reports a mechanical breakdown in Jacumba, California.
- 9 p.m. - He resumes his trip in a new vehicle.
Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2015
- 1:31 a.m. - He calls his son to report having been sideswiped by another vehicle in a minor crash in Los Angeles.
- 1:49 a.m. - 2:07 a.m. - He attempts to contact his supervisor to report the crash.
- 2:19 a.m. - He calls 911 to report the crash.
- 5:32 a.m. - He turns onto the railroad tracks in Oxnard.
- 5:44 a.m. - Crash occurs.
Data extracted from Sanchez-Ramirez's cell phone indicated that a navigation application was supplying information up to the time of the crash, the report said.
""It is possible he relied on the navigation application to find his destination and subsequently misinterpreted the visual and audible cues available to him,"" the report said.
Sanchez-Ramirez was interviewed by Oxnard police after the crash, the report said. According to Sanchez-Ramirez, his truck became stuck on the tracks about 80 feet after turning onto them. He said he attempted to push the vehicle off the tracks, but couldn't. He also said he tried to call 911, but was in a state of panic and couldn't do that either.
The report makes two safety recommendations:
- It urges Google, Apple, Microsoft, MapQuest and other technology companies to incorporate grade crossing-related geographic data into their navigation applications ""to reduce the likelihood of crashes at or near public or private grade crossings.""
- It urges the North American Cartographic Information Society to use existing newsletters and other forms of communication with its members to highlight the importance of creating navigation applications that incorporate grade crossing-related geographic data, such as those currently being prepared by the Federal Railroad Administration, to provide road users with additional safety cues.
Metrolink spokeswoman Sherita Coffelt said in a prepared statement that the agency, which operates a 512 route-mile network in Ventura County and five other Southern California counties, has received the report, which contained no recommendations for Metrolink.
""Staff is in the process of completing a full legal, engineering and technical analysis of the report,"" she said. ""Metrolink has fully cooperated with the NTSB throughout their investigation and took actions to enhance safety for our passengers and team members prior to the release of this report.""
For instance, because of a Metrolink internal review after the Oxnard crash, the agency is repairing a fleet-wide defect on its Hyundai Rotem cab cars, she said.",Metrolink,Hyundai Rotem,Metrolink,Unknown,2015-02-24,5:44 a.m.,Unknown,Unknown,California,CA,Oxnard,South Rice Avenue,B,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,2,,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,Not applicable,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,No,Yes,Unknown,Alex Smith,Signature: Not Provided,Date: Unknown

The tragedy created heroes, drew villains and allowed Mary Pickford, the greatest film actress of the day, to play a real-life heroine.
On March 29, to mark the anniversary of the disaster, Amherst erected a simple, somber monument to tell the story of the city's catastrophe at Sandstone Village, a recreated 1800s town on Milan Avenue.
Historian Jim Wilhelm, who also serves as the assistant fire chief of Amherst, has made it his personal mission to educate people about the tragedy.
It started with two trains headed east to Pittsburgh and ultimately New York City. The second train had been added to carry the overflow from the crowded first train, and it followed nine minutes behind it.
As the first train approached the old Amherst switching station around 3:15 a.m., the engineer stopped because a danger signal light was on. Heavy fog kept the engineer from seeing very far down the tracks. He got out to talk to the switching station worker, fearing there was a broken track or an obstacle on the tracks ahead.
""It turned out to be a bogus signal,"" Wilhelm said. ""It turned itself off before the engineer reached the tower. The engineer got back on board and tried to get the train moving again. That was the trouble, he could not get it moving from the dead stop. The wheels spun on the tracks.""
The train finally started to inch forward. The dense fog prevented the engineer on the second train from seeing that the first one was barely moving.
""He plowed right into it,"" Wilhelm said. ""The second train tore right through the two rear cars of the first train, and knocked other cars over onto the tracks.""
Minutes later, a westbound train, headed from New York to Los Angeles, crashed into the derailed trains.
Wilhelm said the sounds of the crash and the sounds of trapped victims screaming cut through the still night and could be heard for miles.
Thousands of people converged at the crash site.
Some came to render whatever assistance they could. Although 27 people were killed in the crash, a 28th died the next day of injuries, and at least 47 people were badly injured. Missing or crushed arms and legs and massive head injuries were common. Doctors, nurses and rescue workers helped the injured and transported them to nearby hospitals.
Other heroes were the workers who had the monumental task of moving hundreds of tons of twisted metal off the tracks.
Still others drawn to the scene were heartless thieves.
""It was pretty awful,"" said Wilhelm. ""People were stealing whatever they found at the crash scene. There was so much going on the police could not prevent it all. One man in Lorain actually stole a scalp that was torn from the head of one of the victims. Lorain police learned about the theft and confiscated the scalp.""
Lurid newspaper headlines shouted about victims screaming in agony and about looters stealing from the victims.
But Wilhelm likes to talk about the heroes, and there were many.
Among them was a wispy young woman of 24 named Mary Pickford, the most famous silent film actress of her time. With her was another actress, Ella Hall, who served as her understudy.
""The railroad people managed to get one engine and several cars righted and able to move,"" Wilhelm said. ""They loaded up the injured and others, and prepared to take them to the hospital in Elyria. Pickford and Hall refused to go, they wanted to stay and help the injured. In her time, Pickford was bigger than Meryl Streep is today, she was the biggest star in movies, but she chose to stay and help.""
That came as no surprise to Cari Beauchamp, who works for the Mary Pickford Foundation, a charity that spends millions to help people in need.
""She was always philanthropic,"" she said. ""She always ran toward people in need, not away. She was the founder of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, now called the Motion Picture Television Fund, that helps people in the industry. Her entire life she was concerned about the poor and the elderly.""
Beauchamp said Pickford was returning to Los Angeles after finishing the film, ""Hulda From Holland,"" which was being shot in upstate New York. Ella Hall was also a star, but not as well-known as Pickford.
Oddly enough, Pickford's role in the crash's aftermath went unnoticed by Ohio newspapers. Other newspapers, including the New York Times, wrote about her.
""Mary Pickford and Ella Hall were on board the 20th Century Limited returning from New York to their studio on the Pacific coast,"" reported the Kansas City Globe on March 30, 1916. ""They got out and worked with the injured. (They) bandaged arms, heads and legs of those being brought from the wreckage.""
Pickford, known as ""America's Sweetheart,"" was one of the last people to leave the scene, making sure that the injured were first taken away for help.
She and Hall were not the only heroic women on that train.
Mrs. Robert Hotz had just completed training as a nurse at St. Joseph Hospital Nursing School in Lorain. She was returning to Chicago after boarding in Elyria, minutes before her westbound train crashed into the other two.
""She immediately went to work,"" said Wilhelm. ""She is credited with saving eight to 10 people who would have died if not for her efforts. She put every bit of training she just learned to use that morning.""
Wilhelm has put together a 14-panel display that tells the story of the crash, its aftermath and the people involved. He will occasionally put on displays in Amherst, even taking the show to nearby cities when asked.
The monument to the train crash stands less than 75 feet from where the crash occurred, on the tracks above Sandstone Village, which was created by the Amherst Historical Society.
Watch the Amherst Historical Society's website for announcements of future showings of the display.
Any chance of putting the whole story on a web page?
""I don't think so,"" Wilhelm said as he carefully folded up the display and put the panels into a protective bag. ""I think this is something that people need to see up close, to feel what it must have been like.""",0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"March 29, 1916",3:15 a.m.,Unknown,Unknown,Ohio,OH,Unknown,Unknown,B,Unknown,1,1,B,2,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,4,Unknown,2,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,3,8,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Jim Wilhelm, Historian and Assistant Fire Chief",Unknown,Unknown

Three crew members died in the fiery crash.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says in the report released Thursday that an eastbound BNSF railway train failed to slow at a yellow warning signal on June 28 and then continued past a red signal before striking an oncoming BNSF train.
The report says the eastbound train, bound for Chicago, was supposed to stop and allow the Los Angeles-bound train to pass.
Each train was carrying two crew members. One jumped to safety, the other three died.
The eastbound train was traveling about 65 mph when it passed the red stop signal.
Activists in Houston who are concerned about transporting oil by train through urban areas have pointed to the crash in the panhandle as one reason for stricter regulation.
Below is the Executive Summary of the preliminary report, followed by the report itself:
Executive Summary
The information in this report is preliminary and will be supplemented or corrected during the course of the investigation.
On Tuesday, June 28, 2016, at 8:21 a.m. central daylight time, two BNSF Railway (BNSF) trains collided at milepost 525.4 on the BNSF's Panhandle Subdivision. (See figure 1.) Each train was crewed by a locomotive engineer and a conductor. Eastbound train S-LACLPC1-26K consisted of 3 head-end locomotives, 2 distributive power units, and 56 loaded cars, and westbound train Q-CHISBD6-27L consisted of 5 head-end locomotives and 54 loaded cars. The signal system was lined to route the westbound train into the Panhandle control point siding at milepost 526.1 while holding the eastbound train on the main track before the east end of the siding. The collision,which caused the derailment of the locomotives and several cars from both trains, occurred about one-half mile east of the east switch (east end) of the Panhandle siding. The weather at the time of the accident was clear and 74°F. The collision and derailment resulted in a significant fire. Three crew members died in the accident—the engineer and conductor on the eastbound train and the conductor on the westbound train. The engineer of the westbound train jumped from the train before impact and survived with injuries. The BNSF estimated damages of $16 million.
Train movements in the area of the accident are governed by signal indications of a traffic control system. A positive train control system is scheduled to be implemented by the BNSF in this area by the end of 2016.
Preliminary review of signal event recorder data and tests of the signal system indicate the last signal the eastbound train passed before the collision was a stop (red) signal. The previous signal the eastbound train passed was an approach (yellow) signal. [1] A preliminary review of locomotive event recorder data revealed that the eastbound train was traveling about 62 mph when it went by the approach signal at the west end of the Panhandle siding and about 65 mph when it went by the stop signal at the east end of the Panhandle siding.
Investigators completed sight distance tests of the signal system for the operation of both trains into the collision point, and the results are being analyzed. Investigators also shipped event and video recorders to the NTSBrecorders laboratory in Washington, DC, for further analysis. The investigation is ongoing.
Parties to the investigation include the Federal Railroad Administration, BNSF Railway, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers.
[1] A red signal aspect requires a train to stop before any part of the train passes the signal; an approach signal indicated by a solid yellow aspect requires that a train reduce speed to a maximum of 40 mph and be preparedto stop at the next signal.

Los Angeles County commuters who woke up early Monday morning to ride the new Expo Line extension quickly encountered one of the ugly realities of the Los Angeles public transit system: its proximity to traffic.
At 5 a.m. Monday, just before the start of morning rush hour, a driver in a Toyota sedan crashed through a fence and onto the light-rail tracks, which run at street level along Exposition Boulevard.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority hastily assembled buses to shuttle commuters past the crash. But the accident, which blocked eastbound and westbound trains for two hours, snarled schedules on the first morning that 9-to-5 commuters — many of them new transit riders — could take advantage of the $1.5-billion extension.
“The timing is a little ironic,” Metro spokesman Dave Sotero said, laughing. “You just have to shake your head and say, ‘Geez, why does this keep happening when it does?’ ”
The crash echoed a similar incident three months ago, the day after the debut of the Gold Line extension to Azusa, when a truck crashed through a barrier on the 210 Freeway and burst into flames, damaging a stretch of tracks in Pasadena.
Monday, some commuters joked about cars taking revenge on the rapid spread of rail lines across Los Angeles County. On social media, others echoed the popular refrain, “This is why we can’t have nice things.”
Jason Slagle, 44, of Jefferson Park arrived at the Expo/Crenshaw station just after the crash. Normally, only 10 to 20 people wait for trains at 5 a.m., he said. Monday, there were nearly 100 commuters — and many of them looked confused.
“It’s unfortunate timing, because there are going to be people who tried today and won’t do it again,” said Slagle, who commutes by Metro and Metrolink to Burbank. “The attitude will be, ‘I tried it, there were delays, I was late to work, I’m not going to do that again.’ ”
I’ve always said commuting here is a soul-sucking endeavor.
— Josiah Davis, 31, a new Expo Line commuter
Metro spokesman Jose Ubaldo said the agency worked as hard as it could to minimize more delays, adding that he hoped new riders would give it another shot.
After all, officials said, the rest of the morning went more smoothly on the 6.6-mile extension, which connects the line’s previous terminus in Culver City to West Los Angeles, Sawtelle and Santa Monica.
For every frustrated commuter who shared a photo of a packed car or a full platform, another posted a selfie grinning next to an Expo Line sign or with a bicycle, rejoicing over getting to work without a car.
“I’ve always said commuting here is a soul-sucking endeavor,” said Josiah Davis, 31, who set up a mobile hot spot and opened his laptop as the Expo Line zipped through Culver City.
Davis spent years trying “all the extremes” to improve his commute from a seaside apartment in Long Beach to a Santa Monica start-up. He tried a bicycle, a motorcycle, a 5:15 a.m. drive and a trek involving two trains and a bus that could take three hours.
“I’ve literally been counting the minutes until I could make this trip,” Davis said. On Monday, he started the timer on his watch, then boarded a Blue Line train in Long Beach and transferred to the Expo Line in downtown L.A.
When he alighted in Santa Monica, the timer said one hour, 27 minutes.
A few riders sighed about long waits for trains, and long lines to add money to their fare cards — a common hiccup with new lines, particularly those that draw riders who are new to transit.
Later in the morning, a train broke down near the Pico station and stayed there for 15 minutes, delaying trains behind it. That trip from Santa Monica to Los Angeles, advertised as 48 to 50 minutes, took just over an hour.
A couple on vacation from Madrid tutted as the train slowed to a stop near USC and waited for nearly five minutes before continuing on.
But for the most part, riders took it in stride, and marveled over the change to their commutes.
Armando Cobian, 21, of Exposition Park used to ride his bicycle 12 miles each way to reach Santa Monica, where he goes to community college and pedals tourists to Venice Beach in a pedicab.
His commute took an hour each way — 45 minutes, if he was really hurrying — “but now, it’s perfect,” Cobian said.
By 9:30 a.m., the Expo Line was empty enough that he could rest his bike next to him, and gaze out the window as the train zipped toward the Pacific Ocean.

The adult children of the Metrolink engineer killed in a collision between a commuter train and a pickup have sued the regional rail agency and Union Pacific Railroad Co., alleging that negligence in the design and operation of the rail car led to their 62-year-old father’s death.
In a complaint filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Shawn and Kara Steele seek compensation for the medical care and burial of their late father, Glenn Steele, who at the time of his death was considered the most senior engineer at Metrolink.
Steele died March 3, 2015, about one week after the early morning crash in Oxnard that also left 34 people injured.
A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board released in March 2015 found that the pickup driver intended to turn onto a street but mistakenly veered onto the tracks. The truck became stuck and the train struck it, causing four of the train’s cars to go off the tracks, which are owned by Union Pacific.
In their lawsuit, Steele’s children allege that the negligent and careless design and maintenance of the train led to the accident.
“It should never have happened,” said Tony De Los Reyes, an attorney representing the Steele children. The train, he said, was “obviously” not crash-worthy.
Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said the agency was aware of the lawsuit but unable to comment because it is pending litigation.
“Our hearts go out to Glenn’s family and friends,” the statement said. “He was an experienced, hardworking and veteran railroader.”

Hearing there was another, is disconcerting for Jonathon Grey, who travels to Union Station from New York, every weekend.
""I'm probably not taking the train anymore,"" Grey said. ""Only time can heal that type of wound. Over the next few months, years or so, we'll see how many more accidents keep happening and there's a frequency in accidents, then we can't take the train.""
Alexandra Kennedy, on the other hand, said she still trusts transportation.
""I was kind of surprised there was a train derailment,"" Kennedy said. ""I wouldn't expect that around me, but it doesn't make me more nervous to ride the train or anything.""
The crash Sunday morning also left 35 people injured, the Chester Fire Department said.
It's unclear why the backhoe was on the track near Chester, just south of Philadelphia. The two fatalities were found on or near the backhoe, Pennsylvania Emergency Management spokeswoman Ruth Miller said.
The train was carrying about 341 passengers and seven crew members when it crashed, Amtrak said. The impact caused the lead engine of the train to derail.
Even before the crash, passenger Glenn Hills said he knew something was wrong.
He didn't see the backhoe that lay ahead on the track. ""There was a lot of debris in the track, and we started driving through that,"" the Brooklyn resident said. ""There was a lot of gravel noise.""
The mess wasn't confined to the track, Hills said.
""I looked outside, and it looked like we were in this brown cloud,"" he said, speculating that the dustiness came from construction or high winds. ""We were rolling into this storm, this sandstorm.""
That's when passengers started panicking.
""People are yelling at that point,"" he said. ""There was a woman screaming a prayer.""
Then the train slammed into the backhoe.
Hills said the impact didn't feel severe from the second passenger car, where he was sitting. He likened it to the feeling of a roller coaster abruptly stopping at the end of the ride -- ""but scarier.""
Other passengers weren't so lucky.
""There was tremendous impact on the first car,"" Hills said. He said the roof of that car was torn open, and several windows were broken.
""It feels like a nightmare,"" he said. ""It felt like this is that experience that I've feared in the past.""
Amtrak will operate regularly scheduled trains on Monday.
Acela Express, Northeast Regional and other Amtrak services will be subject to some delays in the affected area between Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, Amtrak officials said.
The crash came less than a month after an Amtrak train headed from Chicago to Los Angeles derailed in Kansas, injuring 32 people.
It also came almost a year after another Amtrak derailment near Philadelphia -- one that left eight people dead and more than 200 injured.
Sunday's crash near Philadelphia made Hills consider whether he should fly more.
""I rely on Amtrak a lot, and I travel for my job in the Northeast Corridor a lot,"" said Hills, who works in the specialty food industry. ""This incident has really fed my fears.""
U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) released the following statement on the Amtrak crash:
“Today's tragedy further demonstrates the urgent need to rebuild our crumbling rail infrastructure and ensure safe operations nationwide. My thoughts go out to the victims and their families after yet another tragic Amtrak accident, this one less than a year removed from the Philadelphia disaster and just weeks after a derailment in Kansas. We need answers immediately – and I am pleased the National Transportation Safety Board has already launched an investigation to find all the facts.

The Amtrak passenger train which derailed in Northfield, Vermont, on Monday morning was sent hurtling by a 'freak' rock slide, the governor has said.
One person - a crew member - was airlifted to hospital and another six went in ambulances to be treated for minor injuries after the southbound train traveling at 57 mph flew off the tracks 10 miles south of Montpelier at 10am.
On Monday afternoon, Gov Peter Shumlin told reporters there was a rock on the track that could not have been avoided even if brakes were applied, adding: 'this really was a freak of nature'.
One locomotive and one passenger car went over an embankment. Three other cars left the track but remained upright.

Shumlin praised the 104 passengers, many elderly, who scrambled up the steep hillside to safety after the crash.
'I've just been meeting with the passengers,' Shumlin said, 'and it's really a remarkable thing to hear.
'It was a pretty brutal derailment caused by ledge on the track, and as one of the passengers said to me, ""Someone was looking out for us, because literally we walked out of a very difficult situation.""'
He said the six passengers with minor injuries were taken to Central Vermont Medical Center in nearby Berlin to be treated.
The seventh - a crew member - was airlifted to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center with non-life threatening injuries.
One passenger shared a picture of the scene from his seat inside the train on Instagram, with the caption: 'Train derailment in VT this morning on my way to New Jersey. Im fine and as far as Ive heard only minor injuries. Everyone is shaken tho.'
And a Twitter user, Brian Bell, posted photographs taken by his parents, who were on board and survived the crash without injury.
The train - dubbed the 'Vermonter' - runs a daily commute from the Vermont city of St Albans to Washington, D.C.
In the fall, it is popular with tourists as it offers a sweeping view of rural Northeast. It averages about 250 passengers a day.
The railway companies that operate the stretch of tracks have had 54 accidents since 2006, including 14 derailments.

The southbound train, dubbed the 'Vermonter', had just left Montpelier, the state capital, when it derailed
Federal records show New England Central Railroad has had four accidents since 2006 that could have involved debris on the tracks.
Of the railroad's 54 accidents six occurred under the management of Genesee and Wyoming Railroad, which bought New England Central in 2012.
The accidents included highway grade-crossing incidents. Three people died in crashes: Two were trespassers. The third died in a grade-crossing accident.
Federal safety rules for tracks that carry passengers require at least two inspections every week.

It’s been a decade since an SUV left on the tracks at Chevy Chase Drive caused one of Metrolink’s deadliest crashes, one that claimed 11 lives and shook the Glendale community.
Metrolink has spent hundreds of millions upgrading its cars and is currently implementing new technologies to prevent further crashes, viewing the tragedy as a motivator for continually increasing its safety measures.
“We’ve come a long way since those days and certainly the 10 years since Glendale, we can pretty safely and confidently say we’re the safest commuter rail line in the country,” said Jeff Lustgarten, a spokesman for the agency.
It was shortly after 6 a.m. on Jan. 26, 2005. Metrolink train 100 was heading southbound when it struck an SUV parked on the tracks near the Glendale and Los Angeles border.
The train jackknifed and the resulting crash killed 11 while injuring nearly 200 more.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, who told investigators he planned to commit suicide, changed his mind at the last minute and left his car behind. He is currently serving 11 consecutive life sentences.
Metrolink in 2009 agreed to pay about $39 million to settle lawsuits.
The accident was the deadliest until three years later, when in September 2008, a train collided head on with a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, killing 25.
In 2010, Metrolink started rolling out passenger cars and cab cars fitted with “crash energy management technology,” Lustgarten said.
They’re designed so that the bumpers absorb the lion’s share of energy from a collision. Inside, “frangible” tables were installed with the intent of folding up upon impact to curb further injury, he said.
Nearly 140 of the new cars were purchased with a price tag of $210 million.
Following the Chatsworth tragedy, after a train engineer was found to have been texting, cameras have been installed to ensure those manning trains are paying attention.
The newest deterrent being put into play is the Positive Train Control system, which Lustgarten referred to as the single biggest life-saving technology the rail industry has seen.
“It’s basically a community and [global positioning] based technology which allows our trains to be taken over and safely controlled and shut down if the engineer isn’t doing what he or she should be doing,” Lustgarten said.
The new system is currently being tested at nights on the Ventura County and Antelope Valley lines — which both pass through Glendale — and should be permanently installed by springtime, Lustgarten said.
An additional upgrade that could detect foreign objects on train tracks is also currently being looked at, he added.
The 2005 crash happened just months before Councilman Ara Najarian was elected to the Glendale City Council for the first time.
Najarian, who also serves on Metrolink’s board of directors, said the addition of quad gates and other upgrades help keep drivers from making their way onto tracks when an oncoming train is approaching.
“You can never be 100% an accident won’t occur, but will all these technologies, we’re really one of the safest if not the safest railroads that’s out there in operation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich was critical of the 3% Metrolink receives from Measure R and said the agency needs more backing dollars.
“Metrolink needs its local, state and federal partners to step up their commitment to fund our necessary safety improvements,” he said in a statement.",Metrolink,Union Pacific,Unknown,Unknown,01/26/2005,6:00 AM,Glendale,Unknown,Los Angeles County,CA,Glendale,Unknown,J,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,B,E,2,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Jeff Lustgarten, Spokesman",Unknown,Unknown

Dwight Howard was sent to the Los Angeles Lakers. Andre Iguodala went to the Denver Nuggets. Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers. All told, 12 players and five draft picks -- two of which that have yet to be conveyed -- were exchanged between four teams.
Vucevic, coming off a forgettable rookie season with the Sixers, was the deal's third-best center out of three. At that point, he might not have been perceived even as the third-best player in the Orlando Magic's haul, which included Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Moe Harkless, Josh McRoberts, Christian Eyenga and all of those picks.
He now admits Magic fans probably wondered: ""Who is this guy?""
Three years later, the 24-year-old is having a more efficient offensive season than Howard and rebounding at a higher rate than Shaquille O'Neal did through his first four seasons in the league.
""He's probably the best player in the league that nobody knows,"" Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I don't think you hear anybody talking about him, but when you look at his raw numbers they are superstar and All-Star worthy, but nobody knows it.''
Said Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra: ""You can't just say he's a good, young player anymore. He's a very good NBA basketball player who is multiskilled and a big target. There's not a whole lot that he can't do from the center position.""
""He may very well be an All-Star center in the East at some point soon,"" Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens echoed.
Vucevic doesn't take the success lightly. He knows everything he has could have been ripped away nine years ago.
""You understand once you're so close to your life being almost done, you value things more,"" he said. ""You're more appreciative of the opportunity that you've got.""
Something felt wrong.
The train was moving faster and faster through the mountainous terrain.
One of Vucevic's youth basketball teammates spotted the conductor frantically moving through the aisle.
""Son,"" the conductor said, ""it's going to be bad.""
The brakes had failed. The runaway train, headed from the mountain resort town of Kolasin in Montenegro to the coastal town of Bar, derailed in a tunnel, smashed into the walls, slowed, emerged and flipped as it plummeted into a ravine.
As the train tumbled, Vucevic, then 15, closed his eyes.
""How does it end?"" he wondered.
When he opened them, he saw his father helping others. He saw his teammates moving. He felt relief.
Vucevic had been thrown to the floor. A teammate landed on top of him and an unhinged door landed on top of the teammate.
Their car had stopped short of a cliff over the Moraca River. It was the only one to land upright in an area that Vucevic said was the safest possible landing spot for miles. He suffered minor cuts and bruises.
""We were lucky, "" he said. ""Very lucky.""
Forty-seven people died in the crash, including a member of the youth basketball team he was traveling with, and nearly 200 were injured. It marked one of the deadliest train accidents in Europe in the past 30 years and the worst in Montenegro's history. The state declared a three-day mourning period.
""I was so young that I didn't really realize that it can really change the way you look at life,"" Vucevic said. ""As years went on, and I got more mature, you look back on it -- I was so close to the end.""
A text message will circulate today among a group of about 10 ex-teammates. It will say the same thing it has the past eight years.
""Happy 2nd Birthday,"" it reads, reminding them all of the second chance they received on Jan. 23, 2006.
This year, the message will come sometime before Vucevic takes the court at Madison Square Garden for the 189th start of his pro career.
With Orlando, Vucevic has received the kind of playing time he says he didn't get enough of in Philly, starting every game he's played and logging an average of 34 minutes a game.
Now leading the league in double-doubles and averaging 18.8 points on 53 percent shooting and 11 rebounds a game with a 21.73 player efficiency rating (fifth-best among all centers), he's firmly established himself as the best player involved in the four-team trade still with the team to which he was sent, and one of the best young players in the entire NBA.
""You're seeing the skills that he brings to the table, the ability to shoot the basketball, the ability to handle the ball more in the post, and he's learning how to produce there,"" Magic coach Jacque Vaughn said. ""He's learning to be effective.""
""Even when I was at USC, I felt like I was playing really good my junior year and never really got all the credit that I deserved as a player,"" said Vucevic, who signed a four-year, $53 million extension with the Magic last year. ""But I never let that bother me too much. I always knew that I should just keep going. In time I just ended up showing people what I could do, and now you see people know who I am and what I can do. I've come a long way.""
All without forgetting those on the train that were never given the same chance.
""It was obviously a huge thing not only in my life,"" Vucevic said, ""but for everybody that was on that train.""",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Jan. 23, 2006",Unknown,Kolasin,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,B,Unknown,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,A,A,2,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,46,Unknown,Unknown,"Vucevic reflects on the deadliest train accident in Montenegro's history, which changed his perspective on life and underscored the importance of seizing second chances.",Nikola Vucevic,Signature: Unknown,Date: Unknown

The new details provide insight into the events that led to the death of 37-year-old bodybuilder, inspirational coach, actor and model Greg Plitt. Investigators have said they believed his death was an accident based on their preliminary investigation.
Plitt, who was to be featured in a new Bravo reality series that premiered Monday called “Friends to Lovers,” was struck at about 4 p.m. Saturday on the tracks at Front Street, just north of the Burbank Metrolink Station.
Until Tuesday's confirmation from police, it was not clear whether Plitt was running alongside the tracks or between the rails. He was with two others during the shoot and did not respond to a horn blast from the Metrolink train before it caught up to him, Burbank police said.
He died at the scene. Police learned he was shooting a promotional video for sponsor Shadow Beverages, which includes brands such as No Fear and WheyUp.
""We are extremely saddened by the suddent and tragic loss of our spokesperson and part owner of the WheyUp brand, Greg Plitt,"" reads in part a statement posted on the WheyUp website. The statement did not address the circumstances of the video shoot or the death.
A call Tuesday to the energy drink company's office in Phoenix was not immediately returned.
A filming permit had not been issued, according to police, and Metrolink had not been contacted tp arrange for a traffic stop and other required safety precautions before a crew is allowed to enter railway right of way, said a spokesman for the regional rail service that owns and operates the tracks where the incident occurred, just north of the Burbank Station.
A former U.S. Army Ranger, Plitt grew to fame as a fitness guru, model and motivational speaker. Plitt had previously worked out next to, and even on, train tracks, according to videos he posted. The videos include scene that appear to have been shot at the same location as the site where he was killed.

A public memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday at The Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. A second service is scheduled for next week in his hometown of Baltimore.
""We are devastated over the loss of our son,"" Plitt's family posted on his website. ""Your messages have uplifted us and give us strength. We thank you for that.

Shortly before noon Thursday, a train operator on a northbound F train in Queens reported that something struck the top of the train, setting off the emergency brakes.
Upon investigation, the train operator found debris under the third car and saw damage to the top of the train and vision glass from a giant drill.
""This much space left, thank God I sat on the other side of the train, that could have been me,"" said Stephanie Cruz, a passenger on the train. Cruz tweeted the shocking tale to Eyewitness News.
The train was about 700 feet outside of the 21 Street Station. A reach train was used to get approximately 800 customers transported to the 21 Street Station platform.
Cruz shared video of nearly 1,000 passengers on the jam-packed train, snaking their way out a back door and on a service walkway, to the station.
The Metropolitan Transport Authority said the errant drill bit was from a subcontractor, Griffin Dewatering, as part of the ongoing East Side Access Project, which eventually will link the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal.
Workers were boring a hole for the project, but obviously drilled in the wrong spot, as the fully loaded F train thundered along.
Workers and supervisors converged on the site to try to figure out how they managed to drop the drill in what clearly was the wrong spot.
The site was shutdown all day Friday and the giant drill was in pieces.
Neighbors shook their heads in disbelief.

Gregg Allman Dismissed From ‘Midnight Rider’ Lawsuit
Taken from a camera mounted inside the CSX locomotive that was speeding down the track and Jones and other crew members tried to escape, the video released today shows Midnight Rider crew members and stars William Hurt and Wyatt Russell running away from the tracks, with crew members and the bed that had been placed on the tracks still inches away one minute before impact.
The video was played once and then broken down to show the train’s position at various points leading up to the crash. 20/20 notes that the train needed a mile to stop and that 26 seconds before impact the train blows the whistle. Three seconds before impact, Hurt, Russell and two crew members were able to safely make it off the trestle. ABC News also indicates that the bed was what was responsible for Jones’ death, saying it “became a deadly weapon,” when it collided with the train.
Trending on Billboard
“The train hits the bed and the bed flies up and apparently a portion of the hospital bed strikes Sarah and pushes her into the train,” Jeff Harris, the attorney representing Jones’ parents Richard and Elizabeth in their civil suit against director Randall Miller and other individuals and organizations affiliated with the production.
“The shrapnel, it apparently hit her and caused her to knock her into the train,” Richard Jones said.
20/20‘s report also included photos from the shoot, including one of actor William Hurt lying on a bed on the train tracks, explaining that the dream sequence involved Allman lying in his hospital bed seeing his late brother Duane Allman across the bridge. Hurt was playing Allman in the film before dropping out after Jones’ death. And ABC aired the 911 call from the set, in which someone is heard requesting an ambulance, saying “someone got hit by a train.”
After the train went past, hairstylist Joyce Gilliard, who was injured by the train, recalled seeing Jones’ lying dead beside the tracks, saying “you didn’t know it was her,” and breaking down in tears during her interview.
“At first it was like a quiet, like people were in shock at what happened,” Gilliard said. I remember hearing somebody say ‘Oh my gosh, she’s dead.'”
Jones’ parents recall how they learned that their daughter had died, with her mom, Elizabeth, saying that she received a phone call from one of Jones’ friends with the friend saying “Sarah’s no longer here.”
“What do you mean? You mean as in dead?” Jones’ mother said.
“Yes, ma’am,” the friend replied.
Miller called the Joneses hours later, according to ABC News.
Both of Jones’ parents seem to feel strongly that those who put their daughter’s life in jeopardy need to be punished for what they did.
“The people who made poor choices that day need to be held fully accountable,” Richard Jones said. “It’s clear that certainly the producers and the director, they messed up real bad.”
Harris alleges that the filmmakers knew they didn’t have permission from CSX to be on the tracks but decided to try to get the shot anyway.
“You don’t shoot on a railroad track unless you have permission to be there,” the lawyer said. “I think they said, we don’t have actual permission but ultimately we’re just going to try to steal this shot.”
Similarly, Gilliard, who is also suing Miller and others involved with the film, feels the filmmakers pushed the limits to get the shot they wanted.
“They wanted to get the shot, so whatever it took to get the shot is what they did,” Gilliard said. “The entire crew was put in a situation where we all had to basically run for our lives.”
20/20 showed the scar on Jones’ arm left by the incident and she recalled that Miller visited her in the hospital when she was recovering from the accident and didn’t say anything but just cried.
ABC’s weekly newsmagazine also aired video of Miller’s deposition from the civil suit filed against him by Allman, which was reportedly settled a day after Miller was deposed. In that footage, Miller is shown repeatedly saying “that’s not my job” when asked various questions about why he didn’t know that there could be a train barreling down on his crew.
Miller and producer Jody Savin‘s attorney released a statement to ABC News on Friday that reads in part, “They believed they had permission to be on the tracks from Rayonier [which owns the land around the tracks] and CSX. They had no reason to believe that anyone would be placed in danger. They will live with the sorrow of Sarah’s death for the rest of their lives.”
20/20 also spoke to railroad safety expert and film consultant Art Miller, who pointed out that there’s no freight train schedule, so filmmakers had no way of knowing when a train would be coming down the track: “It’s a day to day thing. There’s not such a thing as a freight train schedule that approximates what say a major airline might publish,” Miller said.
And, sadly, the newsmagazine says they found a train trestle just a few hours away from the live tracks where Jones’ death occurred where an on-site official was able to shut down the tracks so the ABC show could film.
20/20 also talked to the cast and crew of The Vampire Diaries, where many of the stars knew Jones well because she did the slate before filming began.
Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder and others all shared fond memories of Jones, with Somerhalder calling her his “cosmic sister.”
When they learned of Jones’ death, just hours after it happened, they were shocked and angry.
“I’ve been working as an actor pretty much nonstop for 15 years and I’ve never experienced anything like that where everyone just went home and cried,” Paul Wesley said. “I wanted to know exactly: What do you mean? How? How?”
Somerhalder added: “I was angry. Really angry and for them to overlook something that jeopardizes the safety of the people that are working with them is absolutely positively, it’s unacceptable.”
Now on The Vampire Diaries, the first shot of the day is called the “Jonesy” in honor of Sarah Jones.
Tragically, 20/20‘s report also suggests that Jones’ life could have taken a different path, noting that she was hired to work on the seventh Fast & Furious film before filming was postponed in the wake of actor Paul Walker‘s death. She then took the job on Midnight Rider.

The man who was killed when a Metrolink train struck his car in Burbank Tuesday was attempting to circumvent railroad crossing arms when the collision occurred, officials said.
The man, identified as 79-year-old Fawaz Khalil, was struck by the Los Angeles-bound train on the tracks west of San Fernando Boulevard and Buena Vista Street about 3:15 p.m. He was taken to Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, according to Burbank police.
Khalil was the only occupant of the Toyota Camry.
Levon Gharibian, 24, said he was driving near the intersection at the time of the crash when he heard a thump and saw the wrecked car, which “looked mauled up.”
The train had 130 passengers, and there were preliminary reports of three minor injuries, Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said.
In 2009, a Los Angeles Times article called the rail crossing at San Fernando and Buena Vista one of Metrolink’s most dangerous, with an intersection that is a maze of sharp turns and confusing signals.
Lustgarten noted that trains can’t steer out of the way of trouble and take a quarter- to half-mile to stop.
The collision remains under investigation.
Anyone with additional information on the collision is urged to contact the Burbank police Traffic Bureau at (818) 238-3100.

A blind man who fell off the edge of a subway platform Thursday afternoon and into the path of an oncoming Metro train survived the accident mostly unharmed, officials said.
“It really is a miracle,” Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokeman Paul Gonzales told The Times. “It’s something you only see on TV.”
The man, an unidentified 47-year-old Los Angeles resident, had been using a cane to feel his way toward the edge of Metro’s Wilshire/Vermont subway platform, Gonzales said.
The operator of the incoming Red Line train saw the man and honked to warn him that he was about to reach the edge of the platform, but it was too late: The man fell and tumbled into the track bed as the train approached.
When the eastbound Red Line train slowed to a stop, the man was trapped underneath, Gonzales said.
The Los Angeles Fire Department rescued him about 20 minutes later, shaken but largely unhurt.
Gonzales said the train passed directly over the man, who fell into the track bed between the rail and the base of the subway platform.
A Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman said he may have fallen under a small overhang near the base of the platform.
The man was transported to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where he was listed in fair condition, Main said.
He is expected to make a full recovery.
[Updated 7:15 p.m. March 6: Graham Purvis of Santa Monica was in the second car of the Red Line train when it pulled into the station. He said when the train stopped, the doors didn’t open.
The operator walked through the train, telling passengers that something was pressed up against the doors and that they would have to be opened manually.
As passengers finally exited, Purvis said the operator and a Metro employee on the platform told them not to look under the train because someone was caught underneath. They weren’t told whether the victim had survived.
“I got sort of a sick feeling,” Purvis said. “I wanted to look, but also didn’t.”
Another passenger peered under the train, he said, and indicated that the man might have survived.
“But we didn’t know for sure,” Purvis said. “The whole thing - I was quite shocked.”
Purvis said it was the first time he’d taken the Metro. Though dramatic, he said the experience was otherwise fine, and has no plans to stop riding the train.]

A passenger who was on the Metro Red Line train that passed over a blind man moments after he fell off a platform Thursday described having a “sick feeling” as riders realized what had happened.

The emotional memorial took place at Atlanta Botanical Garden’s Mershon Hall and was attended by friends, family and members of the Local 600 branch of the IATSE union, as well as one of the people injured in the accident that killed Jones.

John Strickland, a local reverend, read from the poem “Afterglow,” reciting “I’d like the tears of those who grieve to dry before the sun.” He spoke of mortality and not putting off telling loved ones you care about them.
“When we’re young adults, we think we’ll live forever. But parents die. Friends die. Sometimes even children die. So tell the ones that you love that you love them,” Strickland said.
The memorial took place just hours ahead of the Academy Awards, where a group had been petitioning the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to recognize Jones during its “In Memoriam” segment. A Facebook and Twitter campaign also urged attendees to wear black ribbons in her honor.
Strickland alluded to the Oscars during his remembrance, telling the crowd, “When those stars walk across the stage, it’s because of people like you.”
Union leader Bruce Doering also addressed the crowd with visible emotion. Doering, executive director of IATSE Local 600, said there had been an outpouring of support from union members around the world and people who knew Jones.
Doering said IATSE, which annually gives out a scholarship, would rename the next edition of it the Sarah Elizabeth Jones Scholarship. It will be given to a son or daughter of a union member who shows interest in doing camera work.
He quoted one person who’d written him about Jones, who said “She flew into our hearts and everyone who worked with her and knew her.” Lloyd Ahern, the director of photography on Army Wives, who worked with Jones, told Doering the late crewmember’s presence was “like sprinkling fairy dust” on whatever situation she found herself in.
Doering also read a letter from a young woman, who wrote: “Sarah, you’re the first example I had of a female camera assistant. You stole my heart. I will aim to be someone you can be proud of.”
He went on to say the union was committed to learning what caused the accident.
“Since this terrible accident happened, we’re trying to figure out how this happened and we’re committed to taking the issue of unsafe conditions as far as we can take it — and like Sarah — full-on,” Doering said.
Jones died Feb. 20 when she was struck and killed by a train during preproduction on the Gregg Allman biopic Midnight Rider. The accident occurred on a train trestle over the Altamaha River near the Doctortown Road crossing in Wayne County, Ga. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into the accident, which also left seven other crewmembers injured. Questions have been raised as to whether the production had permission to be filming on the train tracks.
Doering said the Local 491 union had been assisting in investigating the incident in Savannah, and that there will be a candlelight vigil held in Jones’ honor Friday in Los Angeles.

State investigators have conducted an initial investigation of a roller coaster accident at Knott’s Berry Farm that injured 10 riders, theme park officials said.
All the injured riders were released from the hospital Friday, the day after the Pony Express horseback-style launch coaster failed to make it up an incline and rolled back into the loading station, slamming into another train waiting to depart, said Jennifer Blazey, spokeswoman for the Buena Park theme park.
Ride manufacturer Zamperla, which is based in Italy, released a statement saying it would fully cooperate with the ongoing accident investigation by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH).
A Zamperla representative will visit Knott’s to investigate whether any “programming problems” led to the accident, Blazey said.
Next week, DOSH investigators will look at the mechanics of the ride, attempt to isolate the malfunction, review the ride’s maintenance records and interview ride operators, said Dean Fryer, spokesman for the DOSH amusement ride unit.
Investigators will be looking at whether the Pony Express track featured an anti-rollback mechanism or a zone protection system designed to keep trains running on the same track separated, Fryer said.
The relatively mild coaster, designed for the ‘tween set, reaches a height of 44 feet and a speed of 38 miles per hour over an undulating, figure-eight course. Riders straddle the saddle-like coaster seat like a horseback rider. An automated restraint system presses against the rider’s lower back, providing little support for the shoulders and neck.
The ride will remain closed until the state investigation is completed, Blazey said, adding that the train waiting in the station was damaged in the accident.
In September 2009, a cable snapped on the hydraulically launched Xcelerator coaster at Knott’s, spraying debris that injured two riders. A state investigation blamed the Xcelerator accident on both Knott’s and the ride manufacturer, Switzerland-based Intamin AG.

An investigation was underway Monday into the cause of a freight train derailment in southwestern New Mexico that killed the three people onboard.
The Southwestern Railroads train carrying iron ore derailed and crashed about three miles outside of Bayard, N.M., around midday Saturday, New Mexico State Police Lt. Emmanuel Gutierrez told the Los Angeles Times.
“It’s a very mountainous area, rugged terrain,” Gutierrez said. “It’s rural, out in the mountains.”
Donald White, 38, of Silver City, N.M., Steven Corse, 60, of Paulden, Ariz., and Ann Thompson, 50, of Paulden, were killed in the crash, officials said.
White and Corse were involved in operating the train, said Guterriez, who added that he couldn’t confirm Thompson’s purpose onboard.
The train was carrying eight rail cars of iron ore, Gutierrez said.
Photos from the scene showed the train’s engine derailed and separated from the other cars, resting on its side in a shallow gully along a curve in the tracks.
A Southwestern Railroads official told The Times that government investigators were looking into the crash, and that the company would put out a statement Monday afternoon.
Representatives for the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, which typically investigate such incidents, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

NEW DELHI -- At least 28 people were killed Monday when an express train at a remote station in northern India plowed into people crossing the tracks, according to witnesses, officials and local media.
The accident prompted an angry crowd to attack the station and set fire to two trains.
The victims, mostly area residents heading for a nearby temple, had just gotten off a local train at Dhamara Ghat station in northern Bihar state when they were hit by the express train on a parallel track about 8:30 a.m.
In addition to the 28 confirmed dead, many were grievously injured, said Madhuresh Kumar, general manager of the East Central Railway, speaking by telephone from the Dhamara Ghat station. “The station is completely damaged,” he added.
The express train passing through Dhamara Ghat was traveling about 50 miles per hour when it struck the pedestrians, state railways minister Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury told reporters. The train stopped several hundred yards down the track.
“The driver ran away,” said Vinod Karna, a reporter with Dainik Jagran, a local Hindi-language newspaper.
But while some questioned the driver’s role, Arunendra Kumar, chairman of the Railway Board (and not related to Madhuresh Kumar), told a news conference in New Delhi that pedestrians were at fault for “trespassing” on railway property.
Several of those injured were in critical condition, he added, so the death toll could climb further. A preliminary investigation has been ordered, he said.
Video footage showed a train parked at a small platform enveloped in thick black smoke with flames shooting from its windows. Mutilated bodies were laid out near the tracks, some wearing the saffron robes of Hindu pilgrims, surrounded by onlookers.
Police said they were unable to send more security to the remote site, which was difficult to reach by road. The railway tried to send doctors and nurses by train, Chowdhury said, but were deterred by blocked tracks and a fear they might be attacked.
Sunil Kumar, 26, a local farmer who witnessed the accident, said thousands of people from surrounding villages come to nearby Katyani Sthan temple to honor of the Hindu god Lord Shiva every Monday and Friday. There’s no proper road or overpass, he said, so people have no choice but to cross the tracks.
As a large crowd crossed the track Monday, the express train approached without blowing its whistle, he said.
“It came on a track between two stationary trains parked on platforms one and two, so they couldn’t see what was coming and had no way to get out of the way,” he said. “The driver hit the devotees from behind and, because he was going so fast, they were dragged 100 to 200 yards before getting tossed alongside the tracks.”
The assembled crowd, reinforced by people from nearby villages, grew increasingly angry and started shouting, Sunil Kumar said, before setting fire to the express train and the local train most pilgrims had arrived on.
As the flames intensified, Sunil Kumar said he and several other men pulled the bodies away from the burning train so they wouldn’t be charred, which would’ve hampered identification.
“I pulled a dead body away from the train of a mother holding her child, both dead,” he said. “The sight was terrible.”
India’s vast state-owned railway operates some 9,000 passenger trains daily carrying about 18 million passengers. But the British-built system is aging, overburdened and in need of maintenance. A government safety panel reported last year that 15,000 people die in railway accidents each year, including many slum dwellers living right along the tracks, with tens of thousands maimed.
Railway official Madhuresh Kumar said two locomotives and 22 carriages were torched Monday. Mobs in India frequently attack government officials, burn trains and destroy property after an accident, in a nation where corruption is endemic and legal cases can drag on for years. Last September, a freight train was set on fire by angry locals after it rammed into a truck, killing eight.
On Monday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed shock in a statement at the loss of life and appealed for calm so relief and rescue operations could be carried out “without any hindrance.”

Nine of the train’s 190 passengers were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Shawn Lenske said. Four others, including the truck’s driver, were treated at the scene and released.
The train was headed south from Lancaster toward Union Station in downtown Los Angeles when the collision happened at 2:24 p.m., Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said.
“The gates were functioning, but why the truck was on the tracks at the time, I don’t know,” he said.
The incident is under investigation, Lustgarten said.
“This truck ... somehow got stuck at a light at the intersection of San Fernando and Branford,” LAPD Sgt. Kurt Smith told KTLA. “[The] train came through, and trains don’t stop immediately and as you see, the truck got taken out.”

A Metrolink train collided with a car carrier Saturday night, sending three people to the hospital with minor injuries.
The crash occurred at about 9:40 p.m. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department identified the location as 23651 Pine Street, just south of the intersection of Pine and Newhall Avenue.
According to witnesses at the scene, the train hit the car carrier after it got stuck on the tracks.
A woman who was with the car carrier said she and her male driver were from out of town and got lost on Pine Street. The woman, Demeta Freed (phonetic spelling), said they met up with another, larger 10-car carrier, whose occupants told them to turn around.
Evidently they were in the process of doing so when the pair’s trailer got stuck on the train tracks.
They exited the vehicle.
Freed said her driver wanted to call 9-1-1 but the people in the other car carrier told them not to worry about it because no trains come through the area at that time of night.
In fact, Metrolink Train No. 271 was outbound from Union Station and due to arrive in Newhall at 9:40 p.m. and would have reached Santa Clarita station at 9:48 p.m.
The train crunched the cab of the semi-truck and damaged at least two of the new Lexus vehicles it was carrying.
Freed said she asked the occupants of the other car carrier to stick around after the crash but they disappeared.
One of the 220 Metrolink passengers, who identified himself as Vietzke, said he wasn’t able to see what happened from inside the train.
“It was just kind of a hard stop,” Vietzke said. “We didn’t see a thing. All we did was feel this thing like he jammed the brakes on, all at once.”
Three train passengers were observed being transported to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital with minor injuries.
There were no injuries to the parties in the car carrier because they were standing outside of their vehicle when the train hit it.

The train was traveling an estimated 15 to 20 miles per hour when it struck the stationary Amtrak passenger train about 10 p.m., said Oakland Fire Department battalion chief Emon Usher.
Most of the injuries were minor, but several people were taken to local hospitals, Usher said.
Usher said the company told him that train went through a red light.
""According to the Amtrak representative, the train traveling should have never continued past the red signal,"" Usher told The Associated Press.
Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole said he could not comment on the report of the train running a red light. He described the crash as it as a ""low speed"" collision between Amtrak's ""San Joaquin,"" a train that operates between Bakersfield to Oakland, and the Coast Starlight, a train from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The San Joaquin ran head-on into the Coast Starlight train, Cole said.
He said the wheels of each lead engine went off the track.
Authorities said there were injured on both trains, but there was no breakdown on how many from each.
The Associated Press put the number of injured at 16, but Reuters quoted Usher as saying 18 people were hurt, including one person who suffered a broken arm.
Usher said a mixture of passengers and crew members suffered minor injuries. ""None of them are considered to be life-threatening,"" he added.
Usher said about 40 to 45 emergency personnel responded to the accident.
Alton Smith, a passenger on one of the trains, told television station KTVU that he felt ""an awful jolt"" from the impact.
The San Joaquin train had eight passengers, while there were 137 passengers on the Coast Starlight train, Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole said.
About two hours after the crash, about 50 passengers were gathered inside the train terminal, talking to Amtrak officials, while Amtrak and local officials inspected the two trains.
The cause of the crash is under investigation.
Amtrak officials said train traffic has been temporarily suspended at the station.
Passengers who paid for travel on canceled trains can contact Amtrak to receive a refund without fee or penalty, according to Amtrak.
The crash is the second significant incident in two weeks in the San Francisco East Bay area where there were injuries to Amtrak passengers.
On Sept. 30, 37 passengers and two crew members suffered minor to moderate injuries when an Amtrak passenger train collided with a truck at a crossing near Brentwood where there were no lights or gates.

(AP) - A Southern California surgical team on Friday amputated the arm of a freight train engineer to free him from the wreckage of a locomotive that rear-ended a slow moving freighter on tracks 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
Two people on the train, including the engineer, who is in critical condition, were hospitalized at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center.
The westbound Union Pacific train struck a slower-moving train in the Fontana at about 11:55 p.m. Thursday, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Maurice Moore said. Several cars derailed and the locomotive wound up on top of a freight car. The slower freight train was hauling I-beams that pierced the locomotive of the faster train, trapping the engineer, Moore said.
Firefighters were unable to get the trapped engineer out of the wrecked Union Pacific locomotive and a surgical team was called in to amputate his arm, Moore said. The engineer is expected to survive.
The other hospitalized railroad worker had moderate injuries.
The speed of the trains wasn't known. Calls to Union Pacific spokesman Aaron Hunt weren't immediately returned.
The wreck alongside eastbound lanes of Interstate 10 at Cherry Avenue created a traffic crush for more than four hours.
Emergency vehicles used the freeway to access the wreckage and it was feared hazardous materials might be leaking from a rail tanker, Moore said. It was later determined there were no dangerous materials in the wreckage.

Doctor remembers Metrolink crash
One year ago Saturday, a Metrolink commuter train crashed in Chatsworth in the northern San Fernando Valley. Investigators believe the train ran a red light and slammed head-on into a Union Pacific Freight train. The crash – the worst in Metrolink history – killed 25 people and injured dozens more. Shortly after the crash, KPCC’s Frank Stoltze spoke with the man who helped lead the effort to save lives that day.
Frank Stoltze: Around 4:30 on a Friday afternoon, emergency operators began to field phone calls – this one from a passenger on board Metrolink Train 111.
Passenger: We had a collision with something. We have a whole bunch of people who are now bleeding and on the floor.
911 Operator: Is it a train?
Passenger: It’s the Metrolink train.
911 Operator: OK. Can you give me an intersection or something close to, uh...
Passenger: We’re almost at the first tunnel going towards Simi Valley.
Dr. Marc Eckstein: I had just actually gotten home. I live in the West Valley. And probably 15 minutes later, my pager started going off and my cell phone started going off.
Stoltze: Doctor Marc Eckstein is medical director of the Los Angeles City Fire department.
Eckstein: And I heard something about a train crash and I immediately flipped on the TV news and saw live footage from helicopters, and just within a glance I realized this was bad.
Stoltze: For two decades, in addition to his job with the Fire Department, Eckstein’s worked in the emergency room at L.A. County USC Hospital. Before that he was a paramedic in New York City. He said last year’s Metrolink train crash was unlike anything he’d seen – even in another commuter train collision four years ago.
Eckstein: I responded with our urban search and rescue team to 9/11, to the World Trade Center. And in terms of carnage, there was devastation but not much in the way of bodies or victims. The 2005 Metrolink crash, there were many, many more patients because there were two trains with more cars, but there was nowhere near the number of critically injured patients we had this time.
Stoltze:Last year’s crash injured more than 130 people. Hospitals listed 40 of them in critical condition.
Eckstein: Just walking up I could see three mangled bodies that were intertwined with the wreckage. People where half of their bodies should have been, there was train, steel, and wreckage. You know it was eerily quiet. I think the passengers on the train besides being very sick, lot of head injuries. I think they were emotionally in a state of shock – nobody was screaming.
Stoltze: Eckstein oversaw emergency medical personnel at the scene. He said that in one case, firefighters faced the wrenching decision of leaving one man who clearly could not be saved so they could move on to other victims. Once firefighters extracted victims from the mangled steel wreckage, they faced other obstacles.
Eckstein: It's late afternoon on a Friday with traffic being what it is in a remote corner of the city. There are only two trauma centers in the San Fernando Valley – both level two trauma centers as opposed to the large academic level one trauma centers south of Muholland, which then put us heavily reliant on air ambulances, helicopters for transport. Which changes everything.
Stoltze: Helicopters flew many trips that afternoon and early evening, and probably helped to save dozens of lives.
Train Announcer: This is Metrolink 111. We go to Chatsworth, with connections to Moorpark and Simi Valley.
Stoltze: In the days following the crash, some people who lost loved ones showed up at the Chatsworth Metrolink station to grieve. Charles Peck Jr. lost his father, 49-year-old Charles Peck. He’d taken the train to Moorpark to visit his parents. For the younger Peck, questions lingered as he stood inside a Metrolink train remembering his father.
Charles Peck Jr.: They said he died instantly in the crash – that he didn’t see anything. But we received phone calls from his phone repeatedly throughout the night until about 4 o’clock in the morning. He called the kids, he called his brother. He called a lot of people from his phone.
Stoltze: Did he leave messages?
Peck: No. Just silence. And the way they found him – he was one of the last people pulled out – they had pinpointed his exact location through his cell phone.
Stoltze: What was the favorite thing about your father?
Peck: His humor. He would try to make you happy no matter what. He was a real smart ass. Always tried to cheer you up.
Stoltze: To remember Peck and the 24 others who died in the Metrolink crash, officials plan to unveil a memorial plaque at Stoney Point Park near the crash site in Chatsworth.",Metrolink,Union Pacific Freight,Unknown,Unknown,03/22/2008,4:30 PM,Chatsworth,RGV,Los Angeles,CA,Unknown,Unknown,B,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Frank Stoltze,—,Unknown

Metro train car was overdue for brake work | Blueprint America - PBS,"Tom McNamara, Blueprint America
On Monday evening in Washington, D.C., as area commuters headed home from work, a Metro train car rear-ended another car — resulting in the deaths of nine, so far, and critically injuring at least two.
Though the cause of the accident is still speculated, especially following two recent rail accidents nationally in the past year — in Los Angeles, where a commuter train collided with a freight train and 25 died, and in Boston, where a trolley rear-ended another trolley and injured 50 — officials said today the Metro train car involved was two months past due for scheduled maintenance on its brakes, and the car was an older model that federal officials had recommended be replaced because of concerns about its safety in a crash.
According to The Washington Post, officials have not said, however, “if they believe that the delayed maintenance played any role in the accident, or if they believe another type of rail car would have performed better in Monday’s crash.”
Still, as investigators are looking at possible mechanical, signal and operator failures for the cause of the accident, which also injured 75, the Metro system – like most mass transit agencies throughout the country – is on the verge of operating in deficit (a shortfall of $154 million is projected for fiscal year 2010 – see map below).
At this point, though funding issues may or may not have been the reason for overdue maintenance and updates to the train car, two U.S. Senators just released a letter to their colleagues asking for $50 million in grants to improve rail safety technology. Commerce Committee Chair Jay Rockefeller (D., WV) and Environment Committee Chair Barbara Boxer (D., CA) noted that a $50 million investment in technology improvement grants was authorized under similar circumstances before — after the Los Angeles commuter rail accident — when Congress passed its rail safety law last year.
According to streetsblog.org, Sens. Rockefeller and Boxer wrote:

One Metro transit train smashed into the rear of another at the height of the capital city's Monday evening rush hour, killing seven people and injuring scores of others as the front end of the trailing train jackknifed violently into the air and fell atop the first.
Cars of both trains were ripped open and smashed together in the worst accident in the Metrorail system's 33-year history. District of Columbia fire spokesman Alan Etter said crews had to cut some people out of what he described as a ""mass casualty event."" Rescue workers propped steel ladders up to the upper train cars to help survivors scramble to safety. Seats from the smashed cars spilled out onto the track.
Officials announced this morning that seven people had been killed, up from the six that were initially announced, but lower than the nine that were announced later. Mayor Adrian Fenty said officials are ""going to let the investigation run its course"" and said that hopefully the number will not exceed seven by the end of the day.
Fire Chief Dennis Rubin said rescue workers treated 76 people at the scene and sent some of them to local hospitals, six with critical injuries. A search for further victims continued into the night.

A Metro official said the dead included the operator of the trailing train. Metro spokesman Steve Taubenkibel identified the operator as Jeanice McMillan of Springfield, Va.
President Barack Obama sent his condolences to the victims of the crash.
""Michelle and I were saddened by the terrible accident in Northeast Washington, D.C., today,"" Obama said in a statement issued Monday night. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends affected by this tragedy.""
The president also thanked rescue personnel who helped to save lives.
The crash around 5 p.m. EDT took place on the system's red line, Metro's busiest, which runs below ground for much of its length but is at ground level at the accident site near the Maryland border in northeast Washington.
Metro chief John Catoe said the first train was stopped on the tracks, waiting for another to clear the station ahead, when the trailing train, one of the oldest in the Metro fleet, plowed into it from behind.
Officials had no explanation for the accident. The National Transportation Safety Board took charge of the investigation and sent a team to the site. DC police and the FBI also had investigators at the scene to help search the wreckage for any overlooked injured or dead passengers and evidence.
Officials would not say how fast the train was traveling at the time of the accident. The crash occurred in an area with a sizable distance between rail stations in which trains are allowed to travel at higher speeds, Metro spokeswoman Candace Smith said.
Investigators are searching the wreckage for the trains' devices that record operating speeds and commands, NTSB member Debbie Hersman said.
Each train had six cars and was capable of holding as many as 1,200 people. Hersman said the trains were bound for downtown. That would mean they were less likely to be filled during the afternoon rush hour.
The trains had pulled out of the Takoma Park station and were headed in the direction of the Fort Totten station.
More than 200 firefighters from D.C., Maryland and Virginia eventually converged on the scene. Sabrina Webber, a 45-year-old real estate agent who lives in the neighborhood, said the first rescuers to arrive had to use the ""jaws of life"" to pry open a wire fence along rail line to get to the train.
Webber raced to the scene after hearing a loud boom like a ""thunder crash"" and then sirens. She said there was no panic among the survivors.
Passenger Jodie Wickett, a nurse, told CNN she was seated on one train, sending text messages on her phone, when she felt the impact. She said she sent a message to someone that it felt like the train had hit a bump.
""From that point on, it happened so fast, I flew out of the seat and hit my head."" Wickett said she stayed at the scene and tried to help. She said ""people are just in very bad shape.""
""The people that were hurt, the ones that could speak, were calling back as we called out to them,"" she said. ""Lots of people were upset and crying, but there were no screams.""
One man said he was riding a bicycle across a bridge over the Metro tracks when the sound of the crash got his attention.
""I didn't see any panic,"" Barry Student said. ""The whole situation was so surreal.""
At Howard University Hospital, Dr. Johnnie Ford, an emergency room doctor, said a 14-year-old girl suffered two broken legs in the accident. A 20-year-old male patient ""looked like he had been tumbled around quite a bit, bumps and bruises from head to toe,"" Ford said.
Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said less than two hours after the crash that federal authorities had no indication of any terrorism connection.
""I don't know the reason for this accident,"" Metro's Catoe said. ""I would still say the system is safe, but we've had an incident.""
Monday's crash was the third major subway or commuter rail crash in a big city in the past nine months. In the earlier accidents:
- In September 2008, a commuter rail train and a freight train crashed in Los Angeles, killing 25 people. The crash was blamed on an engineer on the commuter rail sending text messages on a cell phone.
- Last month about 50 people were injured in Boston when one trolley rear-ended another. The conductor admitted to sending a text message when the crash occurred.
No reason was given for the Washington crash, but some safety experts are concerned about the recent increase.
""I'm not sure if everyone in the safety system is paying the proper attention that needs to be paid,"" said Barry Sweedler, a San Francisco-based safety consultant and former investigator and manager at the NTSB. ""These things shouldn't be happening.""
However, Robert Lauby, a former NTSB rail investigator, said the increase in accidents could well be mere coincidence.
""Just because you had them doesn't mean there's a specific issue that caused them,"" Lauby said.
The only other time in Metrorail's 33-year history that there were passenger fatalities was on Jan. 13, 1982, when three people died as a result of a derailment underneath downtown. That was a day of disaster in the capital - shortly before the subway crash, an Air Florida plane slammed into the 14th Street Bridge immediately after takeoff in a severe snowstorm from Washington National Airport across the Potomac River. The plane crash killed 78 people.

A National Transportation Safety Board investigator, Debbie Hersman, says it was not clear if the emergency brake actually was engaged when the crash occurred Monday. But she said the button that turns it on was found pushed down in the operator's compartment.
Hersman told a news conference that investigators also determined that the striking train was under automatic, rather than manual, control.
Twenty-four hours after the deadly accident, crews dismantled the wreckage from the subway train collision that killed nine people and injured scores of others in the nation's capital, and a federal investigator revealed an old train involved in the crash should have been replaced because of safety concerns.
The Metrorail transit system kept the old trains running despite warnings in 2006, said Debbie Hersman of the National Transportation Safety Board. It wasn't immediately clear what caused the crash and whether age played a role in the rush-hour collision Monday.
The crash sent more than 70 people to hospitals. Metro officials said two men and seven women, all adults, were killed.
Mayor Adrian Fenty said at an earlier news conference that he hoped the death toll did not climb any higher.
Hersman said investigators expect to recover recorders from a newer train that was stopped along the tracks waiting for another to clear the station ahead. But the old train that barreled down the track was part of aging fleet and not equipped with the devices, which can provide valuable information on the cause of a crash.
Warned of safety problems
Hersman said that the NTSB had warned of safety problems and recommended the old fleet be phased out or retrofitted to make it better withstand a crash. Neither was done, she said, which the NTSB considered ""unacceptable.""
Metro officials planned to replace the old trains but were years away from them rolling on the tracks.
It was the worst crash in the history of Metrorail, the pride of the District of Colombia tourism industry that has shuttled tourists and commuters around Washington and to Maryland and Virginia suburbs for more than three decades.
NBC News reported that among the dead was the former commander of the District of Columbia National Guard, Maj. Gen. David F. Wherley Jr., and his wife, Ann. Both were 62 years old.
Metro officials identified the other victims on Tuesday. They said passengers killed were Mary Doolittle, 59, of northwest Washington; Ana Fernandez, 40, of Hyattsville, Md.; Dennis Hawkins, 64, of southeast Washington; Lavonda ""Nikki"" King, 23, of northeast D.C.; Veronica Dubose, 29, of Washington; and Cameron Williams, whose age and hometown were not released.
The operator of the train that was moving, who also died, has been identified as Jeanice McMillan, 42, of Springfield, Va.
McMillan was hired in March 2007 as a bus driver and was tapped to become a train operator in December, but it wasn't immediately clear whether she had control of the cars.
Metro has a computerized system on most trains during rush hour that is supposed to control braking, speeds and prevent collisions. The system, however, has failed before.
In June 2005, in a tunnel under the Potomac River, a train operator noticed he was getting too close to the train ahead of him even though the system indicated the track was clear. He hit the emergency brake in time, as did the operator of another train behind him.
Metro spokeswoman Candace Smith didn't know the outcome of the investigation into that incident, which she called ""highly unusual.""
The crash Monday occurred on the red line near the D.C. and Maryland border, in an area where higher train speeds are common because there is a longer distance between stops. Trains can go 55 to 59 miles per hour, though the train's speed hasn't yet been determined.
One of McMillan's neighbors said she was proud of her job and was a meticulous mother who ironed her Metro uniform every night.
""If she could have stopped the train, she would have done everything in her power,"" said Joanne Harrison, who lives across the hall from McMillan.
Passenger Maya Maroto, 31, was riding on McMillan's train.
'Going full speed'
""We were going full speed — I didn't hear any braking. Everything was just going normally. Then there was a very loud impact. We all fell out of our seats. Then the train filled up with smoke. I was coughing,"" Maroto said.
Maroto, of Burtonsville, Md., said there was confusion after the impact because no announcements were immediately made. She said some passengers wanted to climb out, but others were afraid of being electrocuted by a rail.
Tijuana Cox, 21, was in the train that was hit. She had her sprained arm in a sling Tuesday.
""Everybody just went forward and came back,"" with people's knees hitting the seats in front of them, said Cox, of Lanham, Md.
Each train had six cars and was capable of holding as many as 1,200 people. The trains were bound for downtown, officials said, which would would mean they were less likely to be filled during the afternoon rush hour.
The trains had pulled out of the Takoma Park station and were headed in the direction of the Fort Totten station.
More than 200 firefighters from D.C., Maryland and Virginia eventually converged on the scene. Sabrina Webber, a 45-year-old real estate agent who lives in the neighborhood, said the first rescuers to arrive had to use the ""jaws of life"" to pry open a wire fence along rail line to get to the train.
Webber raced to the scene after hearing a loud boom like a ""thunder crash"" and then sirens. She said there was no panic among the survivors.
Survivors describe scene
Passenger Jodie Wickett, a nurse, told CNN she was seated on one train, sending text messages on her phone, when she felt the impact. She said she sent a message to someone that it felt like the train had hit a bump.
""From that point on, it happened so fast, I flew out of the seat and hit my head."" Wickett said she stayed at the scene and tried to help. She said ""people are just in very bad shape.""
""The people that were hurt, the ones that could speak, were calling back as we called out to them,"" she said. ""Lots of people were upset and crying, but there were no screams.""
One man said he was riding a bicycle across a bridge over the Metro tracks when the sound of the crash got his attention.
""I didn't see any panic,"" Barry Student said. ""The whole situation was so surreal.""
At Howard University Hospital, Dr. Johnnie Ford, an emergency room doctor, said a 14-year-old girl suffered two broken legs in the accident. A 20-year-old male patient ""looked like he had been tumbled around quite a bit, bumps and bruises from head to toe,"" Ford said.
Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said less than two hours after the crash that federal authorities had no indication of any terrorism connection.
Third major crash in recent months
Monday's crash was the third major subway or commuter rail crash in a big city in the past nine months. In the earlier accidents:
- In September 2008, a commuter rail train and a freight train crashed in Los Angeles, killing 25 people. The crash was blamed on an engineer on the commuter rail sending text messages on a cell phone.
- Last month about 50 people were injured in Boston when one trolley rear-ended another. The conductor admitted to sending a text message when the crash occurred.
No reason was given for the Washington crash, but some safety experts are concerned about the recent increase.
""I'm not sure if everyone in the safety system is paying the proper attention that needs to be paid,"" said Barry Sweedler, a San Francisco-based safety consultant and former investigator and manager at the NTSB. ""These things shouldn't be happening.""
However, Robert Lauby, a former NTSB rail investigator, said the increase in accidents could well be mere coincidence.
""Just because you had them doesn't mean there's a specific issue that caused them,"" Lauby said.
The only other fatal crash in the Metro subway system occurred Jan. 13, 1982, when three people died as a result of a derailment. That was a day of disaster in the capital: Shortly before the subway crash, an Air Florida plane slammed into the 14th Street Bridge immediately after takeoff from Washington National Airport. The plane crash, during a severe snowstorm, killed 78 people.
In January 2007, a subway train derailed in downtown Washington, sending 20 people to the hospital and prompting the rescue of 60 others from the tunnel. In November 2006, two Metro track workers were struck and killed by an out-of-service train. An investigation found that the train operator failed to follow safety procedures. Another Metro worker was struck and killed in May 2006.",Metro,Unknown,Metro,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Takoma Park,"Washington, D.C.",Unknown,Unknown,"Washington, D.C.",Unknown,B,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,4,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,'1','Unknown',Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Debbie Hersman,Unknown,Unknown

Landis had managed to get away from his law office early, giving him just enough time to catch the 3:35 p.m. train to Moorpark to coach his 5-year-old son Jett's soccer team. Along with his briefcase, he was carrying a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts for his players.
Before leaving the station, train engineer Robert Sanchez, a diabetic, phoned in his dinner order to a deli just down the street from Metrolink's Moorpark station, the last stop on his run. He told Hub Hoagies 'N More owner Randy Richardson he'd be there about 4:30 p.m. to pick up the roast beef sandwich — no onion, no tomato, extra light mayo and Italian dressing.
Neither Sanchez nor Landis would make it to that final stop.
Sanchez would die in the cab of his locomotive after driving through a red light and head-on into a freight train, killing 24 passengers. Landis would join many of his fellow passengers at an emergency room, fighting for his life.
The tragedy of Sept. 12 would forever alter the lives of hundreds of people, from the 222 on board to those who should have been on the train but missed it, to the relatives of riders who were killed, to the veteran first-responders who labeled it the most horrific thing they'd ever seen.
'A beautiful day'
For Landis, the ride home began uneventfully with him taking his usual seat in the train's first car.
""It was a beautiful day, it was perfect,"" he recalled, describing one of those idyllic, sun-splashed Southern California afternoons seen on postcards.
A Metrolink rider for nearly 13 years, he ignored warnings of friends who called the front of the train the ""suicide car."" He figured he'd be safe as long as he sat with his back to the engine so that he wouldn't pitch forward if the train hit something. It never occurred to him that the train might run head-on into an oncoming locomotive going 40 mph.
The first 45 minutes of the ride were uneventful. Landis chatted with a young woman he worried would doze off and miss her stop.
She got off at the Chatsworth station, and about two minutes later — 4:22 p.m. — the 42-year-old attorney and Moorpark planning commissioner heard a gigantic bang.
""The next thing I remember, I was telling myself to breathe,"" Landis said from his hospital bed at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center last week.
'So much carnage'
Minutes after the crash, Dr. Marc Eckstein was pulling up to his San Fernando Valley home when he heard a bulletin on the radio about a train crash.
Eckstein, medical director for the Los Angeles Fire Department, put the car's emergency lights and siren on and raced to the scene 10 minutes away. A veteran of earthquakes, deadly fires and a 2005 Metrolink train crash that killed 11 people, Eckstein was stunned by what he saw.
""I've been doing emergency medicine for 25 years,"" since he was a teenage paramedic in New York in the 1980s, said Eckstein, 44. ""I have never seen so much carnage like this in one place in my career.""
Firefighters from nearby Station 77 could see smoke rising from the freight train's locomotive as they arrived. It was engulfed by flames, and two of its crew members were trapped inside and frantically pounding on the windshield for help.
""That was a challenge, getting through that front windshield, because it's essentially like bulletproof glass. And they got those guys out, saved their lives,"" said fire Capt. Thomas Moore, 49. He said firefighters try to focus on moments like those rather than dwell on the people they couldn't save.
Near the fire, the Metrolink's locomotive was embedded in the first passenger car. Eckstein could see bodies of several riders ripped to pieces and intertwined with metal debris from the train. Some were stacked on top of injured passengers.
A train lover dies
Among the dead was Alan Buckley, 59, who may have been Metrolink's biggest fan. He was riding from his home in Simi Valley to his job as a mechanic for the city of Burbank since 1992, the year the agency inaugurated commuter rail service.
His father had been a railroad switchman and he had been fascinated with trains since he was a child. He loved trains so much that he once sent his mother a postcard of the one he rode with the words: 'This is the train I take back and forth to work. The greatest thing that's ever happened to me.'""
""And that's what ended up killing him,"" said his son, Jeff Buckley, his voice choked with emotion.
Like Landis, Buckley had been seated in the front car. He rode in the back on the way to work and in the front on the way home because that's where his buddies sat.
Jerry Romero should have been in the train's second car, but he wasn't.
He decided at the last minute to drive to work that morning so he could pick up his new bicycle. He was at a Studio City bike shop when his frantic father called to find out if he was all right.
""Somebody made the statement to me about my being lucky, how I should be thankful, be happy,"" said Romero, 43. ""But what I'm wondering is when I'm going to feel that.""
Had he been on the train, he said, perhaps he could have helped some of the injured.
""It's a hard feeling to get out of your mind,"" he said.
Broken bodies
Landis is unsure how long he was unconscious, but when he awoke he was trapped in the wreckage with a pair of firefighters standing above him, trying to get him out.
Another passenger was shouting for help. Saws were cutting through metal somewhere else on the train.
His cell phone was ringing nonstop but he couldn't move his arm to answer it. It was his wife who had been waiting for him at the train station with their three sons, ages 7, 5 and 1 month, and who was becoming increasingly certain with each unanswered call that he would never answer.
""I thought my arm was cut off,"" Landis said. ""There was an arm laying across my body ... and I was touching the arm. So I told the firemen my arm had been severed. But I could hear the firemen talking to each other, and they said 'No, that's a DB.' A dead body.""
It had landed on top of him.
The first car had indeed been the deadliest place to be. But the impact was so severe that even people in the rear car had been killed.
""I found two bodies on a staircase in the third car, one on top of the other,"" Eckstein said.
Landis was one of the first to be flown by helicopter to a hospital. He was relieved when he was finally in flight, but he worried when doctors said they wanted to put him in a medically induced coma while he recovered from serious internal injuries.
He had suffered a bruised heart, bruised lungs, broken ribs, a broken back, broken arm, fractured sternum, internal bleeding and had a wrist dislocated so badly it would need surgery.
Doctors were able to keep him conscious during his recovery. After five days in intensive care, he was transferred to a regular hospital room. He took his first steps Tuesday, but he doesn't expect to be going home anytime soon.
'I hope he died peacefully'
When Metrolink resumed service Monday, Romero returned to the train, and he and other emotional passengers hugged and wept.
He posted a note at the Simi Valley station listing fellow riders he knows only by first name and asking them to call and tell him they're OK.
He found himself paying more attention to anyone he has a chance encounter with, not just his train friends. He'll pause to smile and say hi, and one day last week he picked up some Mickey Mouse stickers at work and handed them out to everyone in the second car.
""Things are starting to get back into place,"" he said, striking a more upbeat tone. ""I don't know if it will ever get back in place to the full extent, but it's getting there.""
Buckley had told his family that when he died he wanted to be cremated and his ashes scattered from the back of a train.
His son doubts that it's legal to spread the ashes from the back of the train, but his family hopes to scatter them off a bridge above the tracks.
""He died truly doing something he loved,"" Buckley said of his father. ""But I hope he died peacefully and not in some mangled steel. That's a hard thought to get out of my head.""",Metrolink,Hub Hoagies 'N More,Unknown,Unknown,09/12/2023,4:30 p.m.,Moorpark,Los Angeles County,CA,CA,Unknown,Unknown,J,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,N,N,N,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,222,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Kipp Landis,Signature,Unknown

- Share via
The head of Metrolink warned Congress a year ago that proposals to require updated safety devices on trains would involve “substantial cost” and urged lawmakers to give railroads “flexibility” in choosing and implementing the new systems.
The testimony came as part of a long-running argument over whether the federal government should require railroads to install safety devices known as positive train controls that can automatically apply the brakes if an engineer misses a stop signal.
Twenty-five people died and 135 were injured in a crash Friday in which a Metrolink commuter train collided with a Union Pacific freight train on a stretch of shared track in Chatsworth. Investigators say the Metrolink engineer went through a signal light that should have warned him to stop until the freight had moved onto a siding.
In the wake of the deadly head-on collision, political momentum to make the automated safety systems mandatory began to mount Tuesday, with local lawmakers and California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer calling for quick action.
“This accident happened because of a resistance in the railroad community in America to utilize existing technology to produce a fail-safe control of trains,” Feinstein said on the Senate floor. “The railroads have resisted, saying these systems are too expensive. Well, how expensive is the loss of human life?”
The Bush administration, in a statement a year ago, strongly opposed mandatory positive train controls, saying the technology “has not yet been proven.” Some experts disagree, however.
Feinstein introduced legislation Tuesday, co-sponsored by fellow Democrat Boxer, that would force railroad companies to install the systems by 2012 in high-risk areas where freight and passenger service mix and in all other areas by 2014, Feinstein spokesman Scott Gerber said.
Feinstein and Boxer hope to pass the measure before Congress recesses at the end of next week. The system would marry a global positioning system with digital communications that would track the location and speed of trains, automatically halting them if signals were ignored. The Federal Railroad Administration estimates that nearly a nationwide system would cost more than $2.3 billion, but some safety experts believe that figure is too high.
Philip J. LaVelle, a spokesman for Feinstein, said the Boxer-Feinstein bill is stronger than pending House and Senate bills that address positive train control technology because it would mandate the installation of systems in freight and passenger trains and impose stiffer penalties, including $100,000 fines, for companies that fail to comply.
The current House bill would require that only freight trains operating on high-risk corridors be equipped with the system. The Senate bill would mandate further studies but not the installation of positive train control.
In response to the earlier bills, the rail industry had raised questions of costs and proposed that companies develop systems on their own timeline. David Solow, Metrolink’s chief executive officer, urged a Senate subcommittee in July 2007 to provide “as much flexibility in the type of [train control] systems used and their implementation,” saying his agency remained “very concerned about the interoperability” for rail systems such as those in Los Angeles, where freight and commuter lines share tracks.
Solow, through a spokesman, declined to comment Tuesday.
On Monday, the head of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure said the Metrolink accident was preventable, and he accused the rail industry of stalling the House bill.
“Our legislation requiring [positive train control] would substantially reduce the number of serious train accidents because it provides safety redundancy to protect against human performance failures,” said Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.). “However, the unwillingness of rail companies to make the needed investments in safety have prevented this technology from being fully implemented.”
Feinstein said Tuesday that positive train control is in place in the Chicago-Detroit corridor and in the Northeast corridor, but not in Southern California, which she said has the most high-risk track in the nation.
“We know that positive or safe train control would prevent 40 to 60 accidents a year, and seven fatalities and 55 injuries a year,” Feinstein said. “So, why hasn’t it been put in place? I actually believe it’s negligence, and I’ll even go as far to say that I believe it’s criminal negligence not to do so.”
Mechanical and electrical devices designed to stop trains if their crews did not heed signals date back to the 1920s. In 1937, Congress required automatic train stop systems to be installed on certain passenger corridors after a rash of deadly crashes. But the technology fell out of use as passenger rail service declined across the country.
A modern version of automatic train stop now operates on the Coaster commuter train line from Oceanside to San Diego. The freight trains that operate on the line do not have this system, however.
Tom Kelleher, a spokesman for the North County Transit District, which operates the Coaster, said that if a train does not react to a stop signal, an alarm sounds in the cab of the locomotive. The brakes set automatically if the engineer does not respond.
Officials investigating the Chatsworth crash said Tuesday that they had ruled out mechanical, track and train problems. The three signals that should have warned the Metrolink engineer to stop before hitting the freight train appear to have been working and visible prior to Friday’s catastrophic collision.
“We can say with confidence that the signal system was working,” National Transportation Safety Board member Kitty Higgins said as she summed up the early stages of what promises to be a lengthy examination.
One light was flashing yellow, which meant the engineer was supposed to slow down. The other light was solid yellow, a warning that there was a red light after the Chatsworth station, Higgins said.
“That indicates that you stop,” she said.
The engineer never hit the brakes, she added. Metrolink’s chief spokeswoman, Denise Tyrrell, resigned Monday after she was intensely criticized by superiors who said she had spoken prematurely in attributing the crash to the Metrolink engineer’s mistake.
In an interview Tuesday, the Metrolink conductor told investigators he did not talk to the engineer during the last two signals, an apparent breach of protocol. Safety board investigators conducted a reenactment of the accident and a “sight distance survey” on Tuesday to determine at what point the two train engineers might have seen each other.
In the test, two trains drove up to each other on the repaired track, then slowly reversed course until the two test engineers could no longer see each other. Investigators then measured the distance between the two engines.
That test showed that the engineer on the Union Pacific freight had only four seconds to react after he saw the oncoming Metrolink train. The engineer hit the brakes two seconds before the “point of collision,” Higgins said.
“By then,” she added, “it was too late.”

|
A Los Angeles train driver sent a text message on his mobile phone 22 seconds before his train crashed, killing 25 people, investigators say.
Robert Sanchez, who was among the dead, sent 29 messages while on duty on the day of the crash, phone records show.
The National Transportation Safety Board says it is pursuing ""many avenues of inquiry"" into the accident's cause.
The Metrolink passenger train missed a red signal just before ploughing into a freight train on 12 September.
It was the deadliest rail crash in the US for 15 years.
""I am pleased with the progress of this major investigation to date,"" said acting safety board chairman Mark Rosenker.
Teenagers' claims
Mr Sanchez's phone records show that he sent his last text message at 1622:01. The accident occurred at 1622:23, according to the freight train's on-board recorder.
Investigators said they were continuing to correlate times from Mr Sanchez's mobile phone, the train recorders and data from the rail signalling system.
More than 130 people were hurt in the collision
|
Since the crash, train drivers in California have been banned from using mobile phones while they are on duty.
Anyone found guilty of violating the new order could now be fined up to $20,000 (£11,000).
The Metrolink passenger train was carrying 222 passengers between Los Angeles and Moorpark, north-west of the city, when the crash happened.
Rail investigators have concluded that Mr Sanchez failed to brake at a red signal and smashed into the freight train.
The force of the impact drove the passenger train's engine back inside the first carriage.
Mr Sanchez was among 25 people killed and more than 130 were injured.
The board requested his mobile phone records after two teenage train enthusiasts who befriended the driver told a local TV station they received a text message from Mr Sanchez just before the crash.

The impact knocked the front car of the electric train, which was on a run to Long Beach, off the track. The other cars remained on the track, which reopened about three hours after the crash.
""We had an out-of-service bus turn in front of the train,"" said Marc Littman, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates both the train and the bus. ""We don't know who had the right of way.""
The bus looked like it had been broadsided by the train, with a large dent on one side and a bend in the roof. The train showed much lighter damage.
At least 14 people on the Metro Blue Line train, including the operator, suffered minor injuries and were taken to a hospital, said another MTA spokesman, Luis Inzunza.
The crash comes just a week after a Metrolink commuter train smashed into a freight train in the San Fernando Valley, about 30 miles northwest of downtown, killing 25 people and injuring more than 130.
Chris Romero, 31, who lives near the Blue Line accident, said the screeching metal woke him up and he ran to the tracks. The crash, coupled with the Metrolink accident, has made him wary of taking the train.
""With everything that's going on, it's scary to go on the Metro,"" he said in Spanish through an interpreter.

the Los Angeles-area commuter train that crashed into a
freight train Friday -- killing 25 people and injuring 135
others -- was a gay man with a bit of a troubled past.
Robert M. Sanchez, who had been working for Metrolink
since 2005, is believed to have failed to stop at a
signal near the San Fernando Valley district of Chatsworth,
causing his train to collide with a Union Pacific
freight train. The engineer was among those who died
in the crash.
The Times
reports that Sanchez moved to Southern California in
2000 with his life partner, Daniel Charles Burton.
Three years later, on February 14, Burton hanged himself in
the garage of the couple's home, leaving the
following note: ""Rob, Happy Valentine's
Day. I love you. Please take care of yourself and Ignatia
[the couple's dog]. I love you both very much.
Daniel."" A coroner later reported that Burton
was HIV-positive, and Sanchez said that just before the
suicide he and Burton had discussed breaking up.
Following the
suicide Sanchez ran into a little trouble with the law --
he served 90 days in jail in connection with an
attempted-shoplifting incident at Costco -- but primarily
lived a quiet life, raising and breeding Italian
greyhound dogs.
""He talked
about Daniel and said they had bought the house
together,"" fellow greyhound breeder and friend
Lilian Barber, 77, told the Times, adding that he
never told her that Burton had died. ""He was so
alive and always up. I've never met anyone so up.

Rob is dead.""

Metrolink Collision, Was Gay - Towleroad Gay News","The L.A. Times today ran a profile on Robert Sanchez, the Metrolink train engineer who died along with 24 others when the train he was guiding collided with an oncoming Union Pacific train last Friday in the tragic accident that injured 135 other people.
Among the things that the profile reveals is that Sanchez was gay and had a lover who committed suicide five years ago:
“In the years before his death, Sanchez led a nomadic life, with public records showing addresses in Oregon, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, Nebraska and California. In 2000, he and Daniel Charles Burton, a waiter, bought a home in Crestline. Burton moved to California from West Haven, Conn., his family said, seeking better weather and the freedom to be gay. No one in Burton's family knows how the two men met, but Burton and Sanchez ended up living together in Studio City before moving to the San Bernardino Mountains. On Feb. 14, 2003, Burton hanged himself in the garage of their home. ‘Rob, Happy Valentine's Day,' read a note Burton left behind that his sister Carolann Peschell kept. ‘I love you. Please take care of yourself and Ignatia. I love you both very much. Daniel.' Ignatia was the greyhound the men owned. The coroner's report showed that Burton tested positive for HIV.”
Continued, AFTER THE JUMP…
The paper notes that Sanchez had some issues around the time of Burton's suicide which involved an arrest for shoplifting and some traffic and tax infractions.
More: “In 2006, Sanchez moved into a modest, two-story home in La Crescenta along with his four greyhounds. A neighbor there, Oliver Amelsberg, 83, described Sanchez as polite but guarded, someone who liked talking about trains over the backyard fence but didn't reveal much about himself…Amelsberg said Sanchez once told him that he knew some teenagers enamored with trains that he'd occasionally wave to on his route. ‘He only said that once, but I thought about it when they mentioned they were sending messages' over cellphones, Amelsberg said. Investigators are looking into reports that Sanchez may have been text messaging a group of teenage rail enthusiasts just before the accident, and the NTSB said Tuesday that it had subpoenaed cellphone records to examine the engineer's text messages.”
A sad coda to a tragic event. May all those killed rest in peace, and all those injured recover.

- Share via
There was spaghetti on the stove at Fire Station 96 when the loudspeaker crackled. Right before dinner. Typical.
“Possible physical rescue,” the dispatcher said. In firefighter-speak, it was a run-of-the-mill call that gets the emergency response rolling but usually translates into little more than a car wreck. The voice was cold, detached -- numb from the job, perhaps, but also trained to keep emotion at bay.
Los Angeles Fire Capt. Alan Barrios, a brawny, soft-spoken man and a father of three who has been in the business for 32 of his 54 years, climbed aboard his rig with two firefighters and an engineer, his entire engine company. Among the four of them, they’d been on the line for 77 years.
Four minutes after the call, just before 4:30 p.m. Friday, they pulled up to the Chatsworth house where a resident had called 911, at the end of Heather Lee Lane. Barrios could see the smoke now. He sprinted to the back of the house and stared through a chain-link fence. This was no car wreck.
“We are on scene,” Barrios barked into his radio. “We have a train collision.”
The rescue effort that would unfold from that moment would involve hundreds of firefighters, law enforcement officers and others and would shock the senses of even the most hardened veterans.
By Saturday, as the death toll rose to 25, two parallel narratives had emerged from the mangled cars.
There had been moments of astonishing heroism. An off-duty Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who survived the crash helped numerous victims get out, despite a broken collarbone, a collapsed lung, a puncture wound in his thigh and a broken hand. Deputy John Ebert, 54, a court bailiff, was in critical but stable condition Saturday evening.
There had been moments of heartbreaking reality, too -- when rescue workers trying to tunnel their way through the wreckage encountered industrial-strength metal that broke their cutting tools; when firefighters were forced to face the fact that for some trapped inside, there was no hope.
And hope, Barrios would say later, “is what keeps us going.”
First on the scene
Barrios and his crew cut through the fence and raced for the wreckage. The captain was on his radio as they approached.
The scene started to come into relief. Send five ambulances, he said at first. He got closer and saw the flames. Send 30 firetrucks, he added. Then he was there. The Metrolink engine seemed to be missing. In the head-on crash, a Union Pacific engine had shoved it violently inside the first passenger car, which was lying grotesquely on its side. Two dozen passengers had emerged from the wreckage; some, dazed, were walking in circles against a curtain of black smoke.
Barrios made his last request: Send every heavy search-and-rescue unit in the city.
Kevin Nagel, one of Barrios’ firefighters, had helped lug in 600 feet of hose. He had his eye on two 1,000-gallon diesel tanks from the Union Pacific engine. “If those things blow,” Nagel told himself, “we’re going to lose a lot of people.” He and another firefighter began beating back the flames.
Barrios began racing from car to car. More passengers were trying to climb free.
“I had a lot of people yelling at me -- about the fire, about the dead,” he said. “They wanted to get out.”
Barrios pleaded with them to stay inside. It will be easier to establish a triage center, he told them, if all victims are in one place. But there was a concession, too, in his message; he knew that until the cavalry arrived, he would need to enlist passengers who were relatively unscathed to assist with those who were worse off.
‘Help me’
Battalion Chief Joe Castro, a 30-year veteran, arrived several minutes later. He was relaying his initial impressions on his radio when he felt a tug on his leg. It was a victim who had crawled out. Part of his skull was crushed. “Help me,” the man said, and Castro did.
“It was the worst thing I’d ever seen,” Castro said later.
With the fire under control, Nagel, now joined by several firefighters and a sheriff’s deputy, found a door of the front passenger car, the one that absorbed the worst of the impact. “We didn’t know what to expect,” he said. He shouted inside: “We’re right here! We’re going to get you out!”
Nagel was no rookie; in his 18-year career he had responded to the Northridge earthquake in 1994, to the Glendale-area crash in 2005 that was, at the time, the deadliest in Metrolink history. But what he found inside, amid the smoke and crumpled metal, was devastating. He began to make dismal calculations. Two or three could be extracted quickly. Six or seven were dead.
“About eight or 10,” Nagel said, “were alive but weren’t going to make it.”
Barrios lives in Moorpark; many of the crash victims, he figured, lived in his community. One man screamed for help; all they could see was his hand sticking out from under another passenger’s body. Others were shouting: “Get me out! Get me out!”
“You know these people were going home to their families,” Barrios said. “But they’re not going home.”
On one level, it wasn’t a complex mission. “You’ve got to get them out of there and you’ve got to get them to the hospital,” Barrios said. But he knew it would be more complicated than that.
‘Organized chaos’
Rescuers pulled the first two victims out of the front car relatively easily, by throwing aside seats and pulling away wreckage with their hands. Saving anyone else -- even getting to anyone else -- would prove more difficult.
Only one other victim was even partly accessible, a man in his late 40s, his brown boots sticking out from the mangled seat that had trapped him. The man was able to speak, albeit softly because of the pressure on his chest. It took half an hour for rescue workers to cut through an air conditioning unit and a table to get him out, but that man was expected to survive.
It only got harder from there. At one point, the cutting tips of one crew’s “jaws of life” broke as firefighters cut through sheets of high-density metal. They had to bring in special saws with diamond-tipped blades.
Not far away, officials were turning a school parking lot into an instant airport, with heliports, fuel trucks and the equivalent of an air-traffic control center.
Helicopters ferried dozens of people to hospitals as others landed with search-and-rescuers carrying “go kits” -- bags packed with lights, devices that allowed them to listen through walls for struggling victims, crowbars and hand-held jacks designed to peel apart distended metal.
The air was thick with the stench of fuel and the noise was deafening -- helicopters, trucks rumbling through the hills. Dogs scoured the cars, trying to find survivors. Rescuers hung powerful spotlights from cranes at dusk.
“It looked and sounded like it came out of a movie,” said Searcy Jackson III, a firefighter who reported to the scene from Fire Station 88 in Sherman Oaks. “It didn’t look real.”
Rescuers went on “autopilot,” said Los Angeles Police Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell. He described it as “organized chaos.”
“There was so much to do in such a short time frame,” McDonnell said. “The thing I’m left with is a tremendous tragedy, of course, but also an acknowledgment of the training and the relationship that exists among first responders. It was critical. And in this case it saved many lives.”
Feverish work
They could not, of course, get to everyone in time.
Jackson, the firefighter from Sherman Oaks, arrived about half an hour after the crash and joined a crew that worked feverishly to free a man. At first, all they could see was his hand and part of his torso. Using saws, cutters and spreaders, they were able to wiggle him free.
“It seemed like it was going fast,” Jackson said. “It was probably going slow.”
When the man was finally freed from the wreckage, it was clear he was going to survive. He thanked the rescuers, but few other words were exchanged. The team moved on. Though Jackson was at the accident site for seven more hours, that man was the only survivor he helped extract.
“You never think you’re going to come to a call like this,” Jackson said.
Within a few hours of the initial call, the moaning inside the cars had faded away. The Engine 96 crewmen started thinking about their own families; Nagel thought of his wife and three kids.
“It puts a lot of perspective on the little world you’re living in,” he said.
On Saturday, part of the crew was back at the site, still searching for victims.
“Everybody’s numb,” Barrios said. “It takes a few days to know what you went through.”

Federal officials have discovered that several verbal commands that should have been given by the train's engineer and conductor are absent from audio recordings.
Recordings obtained by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) appear to show that the employees did not call out and confirm certain light signals along their route.
Investigators said that the call-and-response checks for the last two lights the train passed just before it crashed may not have been given.
Kitty Higgins, an NTSB board member, said last night: ""We don't have any recording of a callout or confirmation for those last two signals.
""In any accident I've been involved in, it's never one factor. I call it the perfect storm. We work hard not to jump to conclusions.""
The devastating crash on Friday was America's worst rail disaster in 15 years. In addition to the 25 people killed, 135 were injured, many critically, when a Metrolink train carrying 220 passengers collided with a Union Pacific freight train just north of LA.
Yesterday, investigators determined that the passenger train failed to stop at the final red signal, forcing it on to a track where the Union Pacific freight was traveling.
The announcement confirms earlier statements by a Metrolink spokeswoman, Denise Tyrrell, who has said that the train's engineer ran the red signal and caused the accident.
Today, Higgins said that the train's conductor and engineer were required to call out signals to each other as the train moved.
Investigations so far, however, have found there was silence on the audio recordings as the train passed a solid yellow light and then the final red beacon.
The pair had correctly called the light just prior to those two, a flashing yellow light, or approach signal, officials said.
Higgins said the NTSB would be speaking with the train's conductor, who was injured in the accident, about the recording.
""He'll be able to tell us whether he recalls the engineer calling out and him confirming those signals,"" she said.
She also pointed out that experts had still to examine whether the signal was working correctly and was in the Metrolink engineer's line of sight.
However, she stressed that obeying signals on the track was an engineer's responsibility.
""My understanding is it is very unusual for an experienced engineer to run a red light,"" she said.
Rescue crews recovered two data recorders from the Metrolink train on Saturday and one data recorder and one video recorder from the freight train.
The video contains pictures from forward-looking cameras and the data recorders have information on speed, braking patterns and whether the horn was used.
The collision occurred on a horseshoe-shaped section of track in Chatsworth at the west end of the San Fernando Valley.

“It is going to be a great loss for the school,” headmaster Jeff Woodcock was quoted by the paper as saying.

Meanwhile, transportation officials said an engineer’s mistake caused Friday’s head-on collision between a passenger train and a freight train near Los Angeles.
The crash happened when a Metrolink passenger train with 222 people aboard apparently failed to stop at a signal near Chatsworth, 50km northwest of Los Angeles and smashed into a freight train.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger described the wreck as “one of the worst train accidents in modern history in California” and officials said that more people were still trapped beneath the twisted metal of a double-decker train car.
“We are deeply sorry and we are totally at a loss,” Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrell said.
“At this moment we must acknowledge that it was a Metrolink engineer that made the error that caused yesterday’s accident,” she said.
A Los Angeles sheriff’s spokesman told CNN that the rescue operation officially ended late on Saturday, with the focus now on the recovery effort.
“They worked thoroughly and meticulously to check every single person and every single corner they could possibly find. It was long and it was focused. Now, it has ended and [the scene is] officially being turned over to the National Transportation Safety Board,” Steve Whitmore said.
The federal officials take control of the investigation once rescue efforts conclude.
At least 135 people were injured in the crash between the Ventura County Line passenger train 111 and a Union Pacific freight train on Friday.
Several dozen survivors remained in critical condition and more deaths were anticipated.
Each train was believed to be traveling at the time of the head-on collision at about 60kph.
The impact saw the first passenger car collapse into its locomotive.
At least seven cars from the freight train derailed, although most remained standing in accordion fashion across the tracks.
The interior of the train was “bloody, a mess. Just a disaster. It was horrible,” passenger Austin Walbridge told a local TV news reporter.
The Metrolink train’s usual routine is reportedly to wait until the Union Pacific freight train clears the track.
“There are more bodies in the wreckage, but at this point there is no way to tell how many,” Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told reporters.
Captain Ed Winters of the coroner’s office said more bodies could be seen in the wreckage of a double-decker passenger car.
“We have several [bodies] that are visible [in the lower car] at this time, but I don’t want to cause some hurt for families that don’t know and are still waiting,” for notification, Winters said.
The extent of the devastation and the high number of critically injured passengers taxed the area’s emergency response capabilities, Los Angeles City fire captain Steve Ruda said.
“We treated 135 patients yesterday, about 40 of those were critical patients, which is a very high number,” Ruda said earlier.
Critical patients were flown to area trauma centers.
“We utilized every trauma center in the county,” he said.

A commuter train driver sending a text message is thought to have caused a rail crash that killed 25 passengers.
Robert Sanchez had run a stop signal before his train crashed head-on with a freight train in Los Angeles’s San Fernando Valley.
A total of 135 were injured, with 81 taken to hospital in serious or critical condition. It is the worst rail accident in the U.S. for 15 years.
Devastation: Fire crew and rescue workers continue to search for survivors
A preliminary investigation found that ‘it was a Metrolink engineer that failed to stop at a red signal and that was the probable cause’ of the collision.
‘When two trains are in the same place at the same time somebody’s made a terrible mistake,’ a Metrolink spokesman said.
Nick Williams, a friend of Sanchez, said that he had exchanged brief text messages with him a minute before the crash.
‘He sent me a text message at 4:22. I just replied back “good deal” and I just said “That’s cool”, and I never got a response back,’ Mr Williams said.
Firemen said it was one of the worst crashes they had seen, describing the rescue operation as a ‘traumatic experience’.
There were 222 people on the Metrolink train, and three Union Pacific employees aboard the freight train, according to media reports.

Fire Department officials said workers were continuing efforts to extricate the bodies from the twisted wreckage.
The force of the crash pushed the locomotive engine pulling the commuter train backward into a passenger car, and both toppled over, igniting in flames. At least seven cars from the freight train derailed, although most remained standing across the tracks.
Both trains were traveling at about 40 miles per hour, according to Metrolink spokesman Denise Tyrrell.
Distraught relatives and friends of passengers awaited word on their loved ones as rescue workers delicately dismantled a crushed Metrolink passenger car in search of victims.
The search was expected to last into Sunday as firefighters dug deeper into the wreckage.
Firefighters put out a fire under part of the train and pulled people from the passenger car, which was rested on its side with the Metrolink engine shoved inside it. Two other Metrolink cars remained upright.

The train wreck shocked those who first saw it.
Leslie Burnstein heard screams of agony as she ran through a smoky haze toward a wrecked train where dozens of bloodied passengers were still trapped inside. She pulled victims out one by one, some weeping as they looked about at the destruction.
'It was horrendous,' said Burnstein, a psychologist who saw the train crash from her home. 'Blood was everywhere. ... I heard people yelling, screaming in pain, begging for help.'
Passenger Willie Castro, 67, who was in the commuter train’s last carriage, said: ‘All of a sudden we heard a big crash. Everyone flew all over the place. It was just a big crash. A boom.’
Fellow commuter Arnie Peterson, 47, said: ‘We just stopped dead and everything was flung forward.
‘There were seats and tables ripped right out of the floor.’
The engine of the Union Pacific freighter was left on its side, its nose against the Metrolink wreckage. The rest of the freight train was accordioned behind it. Fire Chief Douglas Barry said heavy equipment was brought in to take apart cars, including one that some victims still trapped inside.

'This is the worst accident I've ever seen,' Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said. 'Clearly the injuries are going to mount and so are the fatalities.'
Marc Eckstein, medical director for the city Fire Department, said 135 people were transported to hospitals - about 85 of them in serious or critical condition.
In the initial hours after the disaster, firefighters treated the injured at three triage areas near the wreck, and helicopters flew in and out of a nearby landing area on medical evacuation flights.
Rescuers worked atop the wreckage and through breaches in the passenger car to reach victims. Dazed and injured passengers sat on the ground.
One injured man told KNBC-TV he boarded the Metrolink train in suburban Burbank and was talking with a fellow passenger when the crash occurred.
'Within an instant I was in my friend's lap. It was so quick. It was devastating,' he said.
Antonio Villaraigosa, the city’s mayor, said: ‘I am heartbroken to see this number of injuries, devastation, carnage.’
Devastating: a passenger is helped from one of the mangled carriages
Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said the Metrolink train left Union Station in downtown Los Angeles and was headed northwest to Moorpark in Ventura County. The trains collided about 4:30 p.m. in the Chatsworth area of the San Fernando Valley.
'I do not know what caused the wreck,' said Tyrrell who broke down crying. 'Obviously two trains are not supposed to be on the same track at the same time.'
Union Pacific spokeswoman Zoe Richmond said it was common in California for freight and commuter trains to share the same track.

The crash happened in an area where the tracks form a 'U' shape, about 2,500 feet (760 metres) wide. At the top of the bend is a 500-foot (150-metre) long tunnel that runs beneath Stoney Point Park, popular with climbers for its large boulders.
On the north side of the tunnel, there is a siding, a length of track where one train can wait for another to pass, Tyrrell said.
The federal investigation into the crash will be headed by the National Transportation Safety Board, said Steven Kulm, a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration. The FRA will conduct a review of whether any federal rail safety regulations were violated.
Asked how the two trains ended up on the same track, Kulm said, 'We are nowhere near having any information on that.'
First aid is administered to passengers in a triage area
Prior to Friday, the worst disaster in Metrolink's history occurred on January 26, 2005, in suburban Glendale when a man parked a gasoline-soaked SUV on railroad tracks. A Metrolink train struck the SUV and derailed, striking another Metrolink train traveling the other way, killing 11 people and injuring about 180 others.
Juan Alvarez was convicted this year of murder for causing that crash.

National Transportation Safety Board officials said it was too early to establish the cause of Friday's accident. Others, too, questioned the timing of the operator's move to affix culpability.
Metrolink announced Saturday - just 19 hours after the crash - that its preliminary investigation determined the engineer failed to heed a red signal light, leading to the collision with a Union Pacific freight train. The Metrolink engineer was among the dead, the NTSB said. His name has not been released. A total of 135 people were injured.
NTSB spokesman Terry Williams said Sunday that 11 investigators were at work, some of them picking through wreckage - inspecting the tracks, the equipment and the train signals - while others interviewed a Metrolink dispatcher. He said he didn't know if they were also talking to four surviving train crew members.
Williams said he couldn't confirm reports that the engineer was text messaging shortly before the crash, but said investigators would look into it.
A local television station reported that the engineer had exchanged a brief text message with a teenager. KCBS said the teen was among a group of rail fans who befriended the engineer and asked him questions about his work.
Williams couldn't say if the federal investigators would interview the teens.
""We're going to look into that, anything that can help us find the cause of this accident,"" he said.
Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said she would consider it ""unbelievable"" that an engineer would be text message while operating a train.
There was no change in the death toll Sunday. There were no new reports of any injured passengers dying at hospitals and the crash site had been cleared of bodies, said Lt. Cheryl MacWillie of the Los Angeles County coroner's office.
Tyrrell said Saturday that the company was stepping ahead of the NTSB in suggesting a cause of the accident because ""we want to have an honest dialogue with our community."" She said internal investigators had reviewed dispatcher recordings and operation of the trackside signal system.
Part of the railroad's safety system involves a series of signals that tell engineers whether the path ahead is clear. According to Metrolink, the engineer missed a stop signal shortly before the accident site - the last of three that would have warned another train was ahead on a single stretch of track. In that area, trains going both ways share track that winds through a series of narrow tunnels.
The NTSB did not rule out Metrolink's theory but will complete its witness interviews and review of evidence - which could take a year - before announcing conclusions.
NTSB member Kitty Higgins said rescue teams on Saturday recovered two data recorders from the Metrolink train and one data recorder and one video recorder from the freight train. The video has pictures from forward-looking cameras and the data recorders have information on speed, braking patterns and whether the horn was used.
The passenger train was believed to have been traveling about 40 mph.
The collision occurred on a horseshoe-shaped section of track near a 500-foot-long tunnel underneath Stoney Point Park in the San Fernando Valley. There is a siding at one end of the tunnel where one train can wait for another to pass.
Higgins noted that a pair of switches that control whether a train goes onto the siding were open. One of them should have been closed, she said.
""The indication is that it was forced open,"" possibly by the Metrolink train, she said.
The Metrolink train, heading from downtown Los Angeles to Ventura County, was carrying 220 passengers, one engineer and a conductor, and the freight train had a crew of three.
The crash forced the Metrolink engine well back into the first passenger car, and both toppled over. Two other passenger cars remained upright.
The Metrolink engineer was employed by Connex Railroad, a subsidiary of Veolia Transportation, which said it began operating Metrolink routes in 2005. The company issued a brief statement saying it was ""fully cooperating"" with investigators.
Metrolink's assertion that engineer error caused the accident drew some criticism.
Los Angeles County Supervisor and Metrolink board member Don Knabe said it's premature to blame the engineer.

LOS ANGELES | A commuter train believed to have been carrying up to 350 people during the afternoon rush collided with a freight train Friday, killing at least 10 people, injuring dozens and trapping an unknown number of others in a mangled passenger car imploded by its own engine.
Firefighters extinguished a blaze under part of the wreckage and were working hours after the collision to free people from the destroyed commuter car, which was left toppled on its side with the train's engine shoved back inside it. Two other cars in the Metrolink train remained upright.
The Union Pacific freight train's engine was also turned onto its side, with the rest of the train splayed out like an accordion behind it.
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said at the scene there were between 10 and 15 fatalities, and 50 to 60 people injured.
""This is the worst accident I've ever seen,"" Villaraigosa said. ""Clearly the injuries are going to mount and so are the fatalities.""
Police Lt. John Romero said the death toll was 10 to 20.
The crash ""made a terrible sound, like a bomb, a huge noise,"" said Julio Pedraza, 35, who lives and works at a nearby horse boarding facility. He said he saw passengers emerging from the wreckage, and he and others helped the injured, one with skin peeling off of his forehead.
""They were yelling for help and crying,"" Pedraza said in Spanish.
Firefighters treated the injured at three triage areas near the wreck, and helicopters flew in and out of a nearby landing area on medical evacuation flights.
Rescuers worked atop the wreckage and through breaches in the passenger car to reach victims. Dazed and injured passengers sat on the ground and milled about on both sides of the tracks.
Surgeons were sent to the scene.
Dr. Stephanie Hall, chief medical officer at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, said three people in critical condition - two females and a male - were being treated at the hospital.
""They are massive injuries,"" she said.
One of the largest medical facilities in the area, Northridge Hospital Medical Center, was told to prepare for the arrival of injured passengers, said hospital spokeswoman Christina Zicklin.
""We are expecting some people. I don't know the number yet,"" she said.
A male passenger told KNBC-TV he boarded the Metrolink train in suburban Burbank and was talking with a fellow passenger when the crash occurred.
""Within an instant I was in my friend's lap. It was so quick. It was devastating,"" he said. The man was visibly injured, but able to walk with the aid of firefighters. The man said he was involved in a devastating 2005 Metrolink crash in Glendale and was talking about it with the other passenger when Friday's crash occurred.
The trains collided in the Chatsworth area of the San Fernando Valley.
Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said the train left Union Station in downtown Los Angeles and was headed northwest to Moorpark in Ventura County. She couldn't confirm how many people were on the train, but said that in rush hours there would usually be about 350 people on board.
""We don't know if we hit another train or another train hit us,"" Tyrrell said.
She said the Metrolink train was being pulled by its locomotive rather than being pushed. The push mode is controversial due to claims that it makes trains more vulnerable in accidents.
The condition of the freight crew was not immediately known.
Union Pacific spokeswoman Zoe Richmond said a freight train usually has a two-person crew.
She also said it is common in California for freight and commuter trains to share the same track.

Metrolink thinks he’s among at least 24 dead
LOS ANGELES – Metrolink officials said Saturday that an engineer on their commuter train that collided head-on Friday with a freight train – killing at least 24 people and critically injuring dozens more – ignored a red light signal telling him to stop.
Had the engineer obeyed the signal, the accident would not have occurred, said Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell.
“We want to be honest in our appraisal,” she said Saturday at the scene of the crash, as workers used heavy machinery to untangle the twisted remains of the most damaged passenger car.
“Barring any information from the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), we believe our engineer failed to stop and that was the cause of the accident,” she said. “Of course, it is your worst fear that this could happen, that the ability for human error to occur could come into the scenario.”
Tyrrell said the engineer, whom she did not identify, was a subcontractor with Veolia Transportation and a former Amtrak employee. She believed that he had been killed in the crash but could not confirm the death. She did not know why safety measures and controls along the way, including communication with dispatchers, failed.
Authorities said that the number of dead found in the wreckage had reached 24 and was likely to rise.
Hope for a miracle held out throughout the early morning, even though authorities said the last survivor was pulled from the wreckage before sunset Friday, just hours after the commuter train carrying 225 people collided with a Union Pacific freight train on a sharp curve in Chatsworth.
Chatsworth is a district in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles.
“They are pulling things apart very carefully because, if there is a miracle, they don’t want to undo it,” said Lt. John Romero, of the Los Angeles Police Department, shortly after 7:30 a.m.
But by 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and other officials conceded that it was unlikely anyone else had survived.
“Rescue workers are continuing to work in an extrication effort, but we believe that the likelihood of anyone being alive in wreckage at this point is very remote,” said Los Angeles Fire Department Deputy Chief Mario Rueda.
Ed Winter, assistant chief of the Los Angeles County coroner’s office, said rescuers had finished searching the top tier of the first double-decker car, which took the brunt of the collision. But work remained on the bottom level, he said.
Families of eight of the deceased have been notified, he added.
With so many survivors critically injured – Los Angeles Fire Department counted about 40 – more deaths were anticipated.
One body, possibly that of the freight train conductor, was found as heavy machinery pulled apart the trains. The body was pulled from the cab of the toppled Union Pacific engine as firefighters shielded it from photographers, then shrouded it in a sheet before carrying it to a coroner’s trailer.
In some instances, authorities said, they have been unable to identify victims, including two women who were taken to hospitals, Rueda said. Rescue teams had worked frantically overnight. More than 135 people were injured in one of the worst train crashes in Southern California history.
Authorities said Saturday that about 100 people were taken to hospitals – 60 by ambulance and 40 by helicopter. All 12 trauma centers in Los Angeles County received patients, authorities said.
Mobile units from the coroner’s, police, sheriff and fire departments remained in place at midmorning on the campus of Chatsworth Hills Academy, a private school adjacent to the crash site. As the rescue-and-recovery effort continued, NTSB officials arrived to investigate the crash.
Los Angeles City Fire Capt. Steve Ruda told the Associated Press that during the night teams used hydraulic jacks to keep the most badly damaged passenger car from falling over and other specialized rescue equipment to gently pull apart the metal. The goal was to eliminate every piece of metal and gradually work down into the passenger spaces.
On Friday, Los Angeles City Fire Capt. John Virant described the scene as “total destruction … chaos.”
“They are in there removing dead bodies that are lying on top of survivors,” Virant said. In the front train carriage, “it was as if somebody had just taken all the seats and thrown them in there.”",Metrolink,Union Pacific,Unknown,Unknown,Saturday,7:30 a.m.,Unknown,Unknown,Los Angeles,CA,Los Angeles,Unknown,B,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,7,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Engineer,Unknown,'1',Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Metrolink spokeswoman,Unknown,Unknown

Moments earlier, a distraught man parks his Jeep Cherokee straddling a set of railroad tracks and facing north, pointed in the direction of an approaching southbound commuter train headed for L.A.’s Union Station. The driver exits his vehicle, pours gasoline in and around the SUV, and then flees.
The three-car Metrolink train, with more than 200 commuters aboard, is operating in a push-pull configuration (with the locomotive pushing the passenger cars on its southbound route and then pulling them on its return trip northbound). On this leg of its journey, it_s being pushed by a locomotive, with the flat front, lead car and its small engineer control cockpit destined to hit the SUV head-on.
At almost the same time, a northbound Metrolink commuter train, being pulled by a locomotive, approaches the SUV’s location in the dark. The engineer notices the flashing red light of the Jeep’s turn signal, left on by the driver, radios the approaching southbound train that something is on the tracks and alerts his own passengers to brace themselves because he fears a collision and potential derailment.
This heroic action probably saved many of his passengers’ lives. However, his warning to the southbound train is too late. Even though traveling only 50 miles an hour, 20 mph below the speed allowed along this section of track, the southbound train can’t stop, and the 60-ton lead passenger car hits the Jeep, causing the gasoline-soaked vehicle to explode as it wedges under and gets chewed up by the train rolling over it.
The chassis of the SUV causes the train to derail and travel off the right (west) side of the tracks where, ironically, a locomotive attached to two fully loaded gravel cars sits on a controlled railroad siding.
The lead passenger car hits the parked locomotive and knocks it off the west side of the tracks onto its side. The passenger cars begin to crumble and tear apart from the massive energy transmitted by the impact with the engine anchored in place by the attached gravel cars. The parked locomotive’s 5,000-gallon load of diesel fuel spills out, fueling the existing fire.
Scores are injured; several are killed on impact. Some of the victims work for the agencies that will soon respond to try to save them. Others are FBI agents, deputy sheriffs and police officers commuting to work and now separated from their weapons in the wreckage.
But the damage and devastation isn’t over yet. The impact energy also causes the lead and second car of the southbound train to bend and crack like sticks, tearing open the rear section of the lead car and the front of the car connected to it.
The northbound train’s engineer, seeing the initial explosion, throttles up his train to try to move out of harm’s way, but he cannot escape involvement. The fast-evolving derailment, second impact and subsequent derailment, causes the front of the southbound train’s second car to jump the tracks and fly over to the east side, striking the last car of the northbound train, tearing open the lower passenger area like an aluminum can. The car derails and rolls over on its side on the east side of the tracks, like a model train falling off its platform (see photo, May 2005 JEMS, p. 47).
As the second (northbound) train comes to a stop, its middle passenger car derails and is crushed by a collapsing railroad tower (knocked over by the impact of the collision), killing and trapping passengers inside.
Tracking the passengers proves challenging. The walking wounded and non-injured passengers crawl out of the mangled wreckage and wander along the tracks like a scene from the movie Night of the Living Dead. But they can’t go far or walk into the nearby industrial area because the tracks are lined on both sides by tall chain-link fences for security reasons. Emergency personnel won’t have the benefit of a manifest to determine actual passenger counts because both trains are commuter trains.
What follows is an account of the worst U.S. rail disaster since March 15, 1999, when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed near Bourbonnais, Ill. (killing 11 people and injuring more than 100). We use first-hand accounts and scene photographs to help you learn from the responders who handled this 241-patient incident.
A main complication was that a massive barrier of twisted and torn rail cars physically separated the scene into two distinct areas, forcing the primary responding agencies to operate as two medical groups, with individual triage, treatment, staging and transportation areas. To clarify the scene details, we distinguish between action on the east (Glendale) side and west (L.A.) side of this major incident.
To easily identify these action areas, we refer to the L.A. side as the Ë™Costco (west)à“ side, because the L.A. forces used a Costco store on the incident_s west side to centralize their resources close to the worst impact area.
We refer to the Glendale side as Ë™Magnolia (east)à“ because arriving Glen_dale fire commanders captured the end of Magnolia Street as their central access, treatment and transportation point (see photo, May 2005 JEMS, p. 52).
Response & Command
The initial alarm was dispatched at 0603 hrs by the L.A City Com_munications Center. The Verdugo Fire Comm Center dispatched Glendale to the same incident at 0606 hrs. (The Verdugo Dispatch Center dispatches resources for Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, South Pasadena, San Gabriel, Sierra Madre, Monrovia, Arcadia, Monterey Park and San Marino.)
Both comm centers received numerous calls about the incident but were not fully aware of the patient volume until firefighters began to arrive on scene. Initial 9-1-1 callers reported a train locomotive on fire, so incoming engine personnel did not expect the devastation that greeted them.
Los Angeles Fire Dept. (LAFD) truck Capt. Larry Schneider and the Task Force 50 crew arrived first at the Costco (west) side of the incident at 0608 hrs and used bolt cutters to gain entry through the chain-link fence. Schneider reported a locomotive on its side and on fire with diesel fuel leaking.
As his crew extinguished the fire, Schneider observed 20à30 people lying on the tracks, and others walking up the tracks–just like moulaged victims would during an MCI drill. He ordered 10 additional ground ambulances and one air ambulance, then began to survey the scene and perform triage. He had his crew put down their heavy tools and begin packaging and moving patients to the treatment area.
Glendale Fire Dept. (GFD) Capt. Bill Lynch, public information officer, was driving to work when he heard the initial call. He responded to the initial dispatch location, the intersection of San Fernando Road and Chevy Chase Road. He arrived at 0612 hrs and”žreported that the incident was one-quarter mile south of his location, with Ë™smoke showing.à“
While Lynch reported his findings, he heard a knock on the side window of his Crown Victoria. He looked out and saw a man with lacerations and blood all over his face, asking for help. It was a moment he’ll never forget.
GFD Capt. Dan Nichols (Eng. 25) had his engine company enter farther south of the scene via Magnolia Street and open up the chain-link fence. His crew began triage from the southern end and determined that Magnolia was an ideal location for Glendale_s Medical Group because of a nearby open parking lot. He then was assigned to serve as Ë™Magnolia Divisionà“ by Unified Incident Commander BC Don Wright.
GFD BC Bob Doyle arrived and took over Magnolia (east) Division, keeping Nichols as his assistant. Doyle had been on his way to the station to meet another GFD firefighter for a run before starting his tour of duty and found himself on scene and in command wearing running shorts and without his radio or operational clip_boards. He opened his trunk, donned his turnout gear and commandeered a radio and clipboard. Ë™It was hard to get the big picture of this incident,à“ says Doyle. Ë™There was a sea of people. I can’t remember a single face because there were so many, and so many other concerns [were] on my mind.à“
Quest for Interoperability
GFD BC Don Wright was listening to Glendale police radio traffic while responding to the call and heard that the train derailment with numerous critical patients was near the Costco parking lot, so he proceeded to that location. On arrival at 0614 hrs, Wright joined LAFD BC Jay Turner (Battalion 2), already on scene, and the two established a unified command post (UCP).
They backed their respective command vehicles close to each other, began to assess the scope and magnitude of the incident, and assigned incoming personnel from both agencies to key tasks. Wright says, Ë™There was no mating dance of à‚Who’s in charge? at this incident. Jay and I knew each other and decided the patients on one side of the trains would be Glendale’s and those on the other side would be L.A. City’s.à“
At 0615 hrs, the UCP announced that the incident would be referred to as Ë™Railroad Incident,à“ and they were establishing a unified Ë™Railroad IC.à“ The command personnel, seeing the extent of the damage and number of injured passengers exiting the trains, initially thought this could be a terrorist incident similar to what had occurred in Madrid, Spain. But Costco employees soon clarified that it was the result of a derailment.
Turner says, Ë™I had a lot of obligations [that] I realized en route. I changed our radio channel to channel 9, determined the magnitude of the incident, processed information and established the CP in a safe location in a unified command [configuration] with Glendale. I then ordered four additional battalion chiefs, two USAR task forces [and] a hazmat unit.à“ Before he knew the total patient volume, Turner also ordered the dispatch of 40 additional ambulances, something he referred to as Ë™a gutsy callà“ that had to be made early.
The LAFD dispatch center switched the incident to a Channel 9 dispatch, which dedicated a dispatcher and one dispatch console solely to this incident.
LAFD BC Craig Fry arrived one minute after Turner and was initially assigned to oversee search-and-rescue operations. Due to the larger USAR and heavy rescue components that complement the LAFD, all physical rescues/extrications were assigned to LAFD.
Fry says, Ë™Early in the incident, passengers were crowded along the fences, seeking a way to get clear of the hazardous scene.à“ He gives credit to LAFD Capt. Schneider_s early radio reports and actions: Ë™Schneider_s cool demeanor and approach to the incident set a positive tone.à“

Luck is always welcome at a disaster. This incident occurred at about 0600 hrs, a time when fire, EMS, police and hospital personnel normally prepare for shift change. The extra staffing afforded by the time of day when this incident occurred allowed the involved agencies to immediately send more personnel to the scene and maintain their ability to handle other incidents occurring throughout their systems.
Hospitals held over their night-shift personnel. Non-trauma centers, not accustomed to receiving serious trauma patients, were able to do so and render appropriate care because most of their specialty physicians, such as orthopedic and vascular surgeons, were in-house on rounds when the incident occurred.
A major portion of the incident ended up 50 feet from a massive Costco store, with an enormous, unoccupied parking lot that accommodated command, staging, treatment and incident logistics for the LAFD operations.”ž
The Costco staff opened up exterior snack bar areas for use by LAFD as patient collection and assessment areas, and the tire center for the processing of patients who could be treated and released. They also provided cases of water and other needed supplies throughout the incident.
On the Glendale (east) side, fire and police officials took control of Mag_nolia Street and its numerous industrial parking lots for treatment, staging and transportation. The nearby Glen_dale City Public Works Yard was opened up to accommodate the large volume of walking wounded and non-injured passengers who needed to be assessed and processed.
Triage & Treatment
Because the wreckage divided the scene, the establishment of two distinct, remotely located medical divisions was necessary. Each had its own triage, treatment, staging and transport areas.
In his initial scene survey, LAFD Engine 50 Capt. Joe Moreno walked to the opposite side of the locomotive and saw at least six wrecked passenger cars and 100 patients. He was then assigned to travel one-quarter mile along the tracks to further survey the scene and triage patients.”ž
His engineer went to a USAR vehicle, retrieved spray paint and marked all cars and locomotives to display information regarding search completion and victims found (see photo, May 2005″žJEMS, p. 50).
At 0615 hrs, LAFD EMS Captain Keith Douglass (EMS5) established the main triage and treatment area near the Costco loading docks on the northwest side of the incident and assumed the role of treatment manager.”ž
LAFD Capt. Dave Soto helped Capt. Douglass set up the treatment area. As he did so, he found walking wounded and backboarded patients already flowing toward the area on the flatbed pushcarts. Ë™We thought we might just have 20 patients, but they kept coming and coming and coming.à“”ž
Soto adds that he was glad to see multiple LAFD EMS captains arrive on scene. Ë™The expertise of the L.A. City EMS captains at the incident proved invaluable.à“
On the Magnolia (east) side: GFD Capt. Greg Godfrey arrived and was assigned to walk the tracks and assess the scene. Godfrey says, Ë™My initial assessment revealed more than 100 patients. It was a surreal scene, with the smoke, rain and fog kept low to the ground by inversion that day.à“
The first-arriving GFD paramedic unit (RA25) was assigned to serve as medical communications coordinator. Ambulance staging was already assigned to a GFD captain, designated as the Ground Ambulance Coordinator.”ž
The GFD Engine 26 crew started triage in the passenger cars on the Magnolia (east) side when they arrived, moving from car to car along with personnel from GFD Trucks 21 and 26, and Engine 22. Triage personnel found patients with fractures, impalements, head injuries and lacerations.
Passengers were helping each other, and Glendale Police assisted GFD with moving patients into the Magnolia (east) treatment area set up in a parking lot at Magnolia Street and Los Angeles Ave. Scene tape was deployed to create a visual walkway into the treatment area.
The joint crews used plywood and any other flat objects they could find as improvised backboards to move patients through the opening cut into the fence by GFD Engine 21.
Burbank BC Bob Trowbridge arrived on scene and was assigned to the medical officer position in the Magnolia (east) Division. As treatment areas were set up, personnel realized that a significant number of the patients were walking wounded and causing congestion in the critical and intermediate areas. In addition, the minor injured were wandering into the red and yellow tarp areas, looking for friends who had also been on the trains. So Trowbridge elected to move all walking wounded to the parking lot of a local business located on an adjacent corner. GFD Engine 22 was assigned by the Magnolia division commander to manage the area, and the congestion disappeared.
On the Costco (west) side: LAFD Capt. Greg Olsen (Eng. 56) was initially assigned to triage patients in the passenger cars. Ë™The toughest decision that had to be initially made was that patients with agonal respirations would not be managed,à“ says Olsen. Ë™We had uninjured passengers assist walking wounded to the treatment area, gave car-by-car reports to IC and had police officers posted to guard the deceased.à“
LAFD Capt. Rick Godinez helped set up a M*A*S*Hàlike forward triage area adjacent to the final impact zone at the overturned locomotive on the Costco side. This forward treatment area, although limited in size, was initially effective because crews could move critical patients only a short distance for immediate airway management. However, due to a steady flow of diesel fuel leaking from the locomotive and encroaching on the area, crews abandoned that site and used the larger treatment area set up around the corner, near the Costco loading docks.
Godinez noticed passengers loading and moving injured people in Costco shopping carts and flatbed pushcarts. He felt the carts would be a great resource in an area where primary stretchers were unavailable, so he commandeered several flatbed pushcarts to wheel patients over to the west-side triage and transport areas.
“ž
Because passengers were separated from their purses, briefcases, backpacks, coats and other personal effects during impact, rescuers and hospital personnel had difficulty identifying several victims.
LAFD’s Ed Elguea (Eng. 44) arrived and began to assist Soto in the treatment area. He helped re-triage multiple patients placed within each patient category, to properly prioritize them for departure from the scene. Ë™Just when we thought the flow of patients [had] stopped, more began to arrive,à“ says Elguea. Ë™So we realized that the critical and intermediate care areas needed to remain staffed by at least a skeleton crew throughout the incident to be prepared to manage patients that [might] be found or arrive later.à“
Despite scene debris, difficult extrications and the enormous scope of the incident, treatment and transportation crews were able to assess, treat and transport more than 200 patients from the scene in less than two hours.”ž
Physician response
Godinez credits the arrival of LAFD Medical Director Marc Eckstein, MD, with the efficient, expeditious movement of patients from the scene. Ë™Having Dr. Eckstein on scene was beneficial. By triaging patients along with us, [he] sped up our triage process.à“
L.A. County Fire Dept. Medical Director Frank Pratt, MD, learned that physicians had been requested to respond to assist in triage, so he reported to the command post and was directed to Eckstein. Despite his tenure in the region, Pratt points out that at this scene he was there to assist Eckstein. Ë™Marc and I work together often, and this was his scene, so I worked for him. He would do the same with me if he came to an L.A. County incident.à“
Extra EMS Captains
The availability of an EMS captain in each L.A. City fire battalion was of great benefit at this incident. Prior to July 2003, LAFD had only six EMS captains to cover the entire L.A. system. Now, however, the department has 16 EMS captains on duty at all times, one per battalion.
During this incident, LAFD quickly dispatched several EMS captains not originally assigned to the area to assist at the incident and tapped their field experience to manage major components of the EMS operation.”ž
Each EMS captain carries color-coded triage and treatment tarps and MCI supplies in their response vehicle, enabling them to rapidly establish multiple, easily identifiable treatment areas. The EMS captains remained linked to each other throughout the incident via a direct tactical frequency.
EMS Staging
On the Magnolia (east) side, GFD Capt. Eric Indermill established a staging area, with police assistance. Pasadena Fire Capt. Kevin Costa responded to the scene to assist, and he attempted to have area hospitals notified of the incident as early as possible. However, the region_s Medical Alert Center (MAC), responsible for daily hospital bed availability updates and assistance during major incidents, appeared to be taxed with the volume of communications underway at the incident. Costa says, Ë™I notified MAC on UHF and was told to à‚stand by; we’re working a major incident in L.A. City._à“ They didn’t realize Costa was calling about the same incident.
On arrival at Magnolia (east), Costa was asked by GFD commanders to serve as the Transportation Group Supervisor. Because of the early request for extra ambulances by Railroad IC, transportation resources were never a problem. Costa requested and received an additional company (Burbank Truck 12) to assume the role of Recorder for the transportation area. GFD Captain Greg Godfrey was assigned as Treatment Dispatch Manager, and BFD Truck 12 recorded each patient_s triage tag number, severity of injuries, transporting unit designator, receiving hospital name and transport times.
Costa, a regional MCI instructor, quickly determined that to facilitate loading the large number of ambulances arriving in staging and because of the wide egress area available he could change the single-file staging pattern and position the arriving ambulances in a side-by-side pattern.
This enabled Costa to simultaneously load two ambulances. His recorder and medical communications personnel were able to keep up with the documentation, and the patient-to-hospital processing speed was doubled. This key operational change greatly facilitated the rapid transport of patients from the scene.
On the Costco (west) side, LAFD was blessed with a large parking lot where their staging officer could also position multiple ambulances in a side-by-side manner and place many more in a secondary staging area next to the nearby Toys Ë™Rà“ Us building.
USAR Teams Utilized
The USAR teams dispatched to the incident were invaluable to rescuers working to extricate trapped patients. Team members rapidly shored uneven passenger cars to facilitate the rescue operations. The teams also aided in rigging stretchers and lowering systems to move patients down from elevations of 30à40 feet.”ž
“žOne victim freed by rescue and USAR personnel felt hopelessly trapped and in danger of death, so he wrote: Ë™I”žheart”žmy Kidsà“ and Ë™I”žheart Lilà“ (his wife) on a seat frame with his own blood”ž (see photo, p. 60). He was rescued, survived the incident and was reunited with his family.
Casualty Collection Point
Because of the high volume of walking wounded and uninjured passengers stating they didn_t require further care, officials established a casualty collection point (CCP) in Costco_s enclosed, well-lit, exterior snack bar. The area offered shelter from the rain, had picnic tables the passengers could sit at and ample space for EMS providers to simultaneously and efficiently assess dozens of patients.”ž
Police Assistance
The involved police agencies played a major role because the incident was also a crime scene. However, they did not inter_fere with EMS or rescue operations. In fact, police commanders arriving on scene joined forces with the fire commanders and advised their dispatchers to broadcast over police frequencies that police units should avoid parking in the way of approaching fire and EMS units.
“ž
Police also helped with immediate street closures, established a perimeter around treatment areas, assisted with ambulance staging and, in many cases, helped carry immobilized patients to the treatment areas.”ž”ž”ž
Crowd & Media Control
Although L.A. and Glendale police were instrumental in quickly setting up and maintaining a tight perimeter around the incident, civilians became a significant problem as they rushed to the scene insistent on finding loved ones who had been on the trains. Media also converged on the Costco parking lot because of its easy access; they had to be moved to a designated briefing area.”ž
To eliminate the civilian influx but satisfy their need for passenger information, an off-site emergency information center (EIC) was established by the Glendale police in the community room of their nearby headquarters. Red Cross personnel, police investigators, off-duty personnel, clergy and grief counselors quickly staffed the EIC.”ž”ž
The city of Glendale also established a Metrolink accident hotline and disseminated the number to media representatives to create a single information access point. More than 600 calls were received during the first 32 hours of the incident. The EIC provided information to the command post, the emergency operations centers, the victims_ families and the city PIOs.”ž”ž
The Benefits of Training
Emergency personnel in the region regularly train together for MCIs, WMD incidents and special events, such as the Rose Bowl, Tournament of Roses Parade, World Cup Soccer and the Super Bowl. In addition, GFD has a policy that requires all personnel to complete a triage tag at least once each month, during care of a non-MCI patient to”žensure familiarity with the tags.
“ž
The MCI practice and drills proved valuable to the agencies involved in this incident. Prior to any formal orders, all patients were triaged and tagged, treatment areas were rapidly established, ladder and rescue companies were effecting rescues, and staging areas and transpor_tation systems were established.
Post-Incident Analysis
Four post-incident analysis (PIA) sessions were conducted to assist personnel in their review of on-scene actions and to adjust plans for future incidents. Metrolink held a PIA soon after the incident, followed by internal reviews by the L.A. and Glendale fire and police departments. A joint PIA between the L.A. and Glendale fire departments was conducted on March 3, 2005.”ž
Conclusion
The unified command initiated by Los Angeles and Glendale fire dept. command officers was a central reason for the success of this incident. The physical placement of the two command vehicles together in the initial moments of the incident, and the familiarity each department_s command officer had with the other, were key elements.”ž”ž
“ž
An L.A. Times editorial on Jan. 27 titled, Ë™A Response of Grit and Grace,à“ commended the emergency personnel who responded to this multi-jurisdictional incident, stating, Ë™It was everything the region could have hoped for. All those earlier rehearsals paid off.à“
“ž
Emergency personnel involved in the post-incident analysis of this event, although appreciative of the praise offered for their successful incident management, were quick to remind each other that if the incident had occurred in a different location or just one hour later when the commuter trains are usually packed with upward of 1,700 passengers, their tasks would have been quadrupled in magnitude. It was a reminder that each agency must always plan and prepare for worst-case scenarios in their respective jurisdictions. JEMS

LOS ANGELES – The man accused of causing a deadly train wreck during an aborted suicide attempt last month pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 11 counts of murder that could bring the death penalty.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, had parked an SUV on the tracks on Jan. 26 but lost his nerve and jumped out in time to see two commuter trains crash in suburban Glendale, authorities said.
Investigators said he stabbed himself and slashed his wrists after the crash, but no injuries could be seen in court Tuesday.
Alvarez also pleaded not guilty to arson.
Authorities said he poured gasoline on himself before the crash in another suicide attempt, but then changed his mind.
Defense attorney Eric Chase said that he believes Alvarez has been suffering from an untreated mental illness.
“He was hearing voices, and he was having auditory and visual hallucinations. So there’s no question that there was some mental illness,” Chase said.
Alvarez has been receiving medication since his arrest and is now “less suicidal,” Chase said, adding that his client “expresses remorse and a great deal of sorrow for the damage that was caused by his actions.”
The defendant was ordered held without bail pending a March 16 preliminary hearing to decide if there is enough evidence to try him.
Alvarez’ wife, Carmelita, described her husband as an insecure man who became despondent because he believed he could not provide for his family.
He told her he intended to take his own life but had a vision that made him change his mind. “He was there, and just out of nowhere, he basically, like, saw a light,” she said. “He said he felt a presence from God telling him to ‘get away.’ “
The first legal claim stemming from the wreck was filed Monday against the Metrolink transit agency by Rita Kay Tutino, whose husband, sheriff’s Deputy James Tutino, was killed in the accident.
The claim, a required step before a lawsuit can be filed, alleged Metrolink caused Tutino’s death because it used locomotives to push rather than pull the train cars.
A call to a Metrolink spokeswoman was not immediately returned.

|
Ten people have been killed and up to 200 injured, some 40 of them critically, in a crash involving three trains in Los Angeles.
A Metrolink commuter train struck a car, derailed and collided with another commuter train. One of the trains then ploughed into a parked freight train.
The accident happened at the height of the morning rush hour in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale.
Police have arrested a man and are expected to bring charges.
Hundreds of firefighters searched the scene for survivors.
""For me this is the worst train accident I have ever seen,"" said LA Fire Department chief Captain Rex Vilaubi.
The two double-decker Metrolink commuter trains were travelling near Union Station in downtown LA - one heading to Burbank and another from Moorpark - when the crash happened at 0600 local time (1400 GMT).

The train tilted, everyone was screaming and I held onto a pole for dear life
|
Police Chief Randy Adams announced the arrest of a ""deranged"" man who had been driving the car, and said he would be charged with homicide.
He identified the driver as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, of Compton.
""I think his intent... was to take his own life but changed his mind prior to the train actually striking this vehicle,"" he told reporters.
Following the collision, one of the train carriages caught fire and another ended up on its side.
One of the trains also hit a stationary Union Pacific freight train, said to be carrying gravel, pushing it off the tracks.
Investigation
""I heard a noise. It got louder and louder,"" passenger Diane Brady, 56, of Simi Valley, was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying.
""And next thing I knew the train tilted, everyone was screaming and I held onto a pole for dear life. I held on for what seemed like a week and a half, it seemed. It was a complete nightmare.""
Television pictures showed some of the 300 firefighters, in light rain, searching for survivors in smoking and overturned carriages.
Helicopters and sniffer dogs were brought in to help to help find people trapped in the wreckage.
Around 200 people were treated on colour-coded plastic mats set up close to the crash site to act as temporary triage areas.
Officials said 100 people were taken to hospital and described it as a ""very difficult morning"".

Very early this morning, when I was waking up I could hear sirens. The emergency vehicles were on the way to the crash. I heard sirens, all different kinds of them, for what seemed like an hour. A massive response had been launched. It is typical to hear sirens in LA but never have I heard so many of them, for so long, and so loud. It was quite chilling, and I hope to never hear that again.
Jim Bornzin, Los Angeles
I cross these tracks every morning to get to work in Glendale. Like most rail crossings, the tracks have barriers that come down when a train is nearing. The crash took place about a 1/2 mile from my work. It is in an area near some homes, but mostly is in a business area. I'm sorry for the loss of life.
Michelle, Glendale, USA
It's really not a very good sign that accidents like this happen still today. But thank God that there are only few people killed by this crash which is a little wonder although it were three trains.
Korbinian Ober, Munich, Germany
I commute to work in Los Angeles on the Metrolink trains every day of the week. To think that someone would deliberately put a car on the tracks - knowing that it will cost lives - is unbelievable. My heart goes out to all the lives and families affected by such a careless act.

LOS ANGELES TRAIN CRASH
The crash involved two double-decker Metrolink commuter trains (1&2) one heading south into LA Union Station, the other heading out. It is unclear which is which at this stage.
Police said one of the commuter trains hit a car parked on the tracks and then ""side-swiped"" the other train.
Commuter train 2 struck a stationary freight train (3) which was parked overnight on a spare track.

Train-Truck Crash Kills One - CBS News,"L.A. Train-Truck Crash Kills One
A Metrolink train carrying Monday morning commuters smashed into a truck at a railroad crossing, upending two passenger rail cars and killing at least one person in the truck, which burst into flames.
There were about 50 passengers aboard train No. 210 from the Santa Clarita Valley to Los Angeles, said Sharon Gavin, Metrolink spokeswoman. Firefighters pulled injured and dazed passengers from the upended cars.
""We have at least one fatality from the truck and we have a number of (injured) victims in the trains,"" Burbank Fire Department spokesman David Starr said.
""The collision has resulted in the derailment of the lead cab car and the next passenger coach,"" Metrolink spokeswoman Colleen Rictor told CBS Radio station KNX-AM. ""Injuries to the train engineer and passengers have been reported.""
Firefighters pulled some passengers from the wreckage and set up a triage area to treat the injured. Some passengers carried the injured from the upended cars before firefighters arrived. Passersby used a metal girder to smash the window of a door on one upended passenger car and helped other people to safety.
The accident happened about 9:30 a.m.
Burbank is about 10 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
It was the worst Metrolink accident since a commuter train was struck by a freight train April 23 in Placentia, killing two people and injuring more than 200.
Investigators believe that crash was caused when the crew of a Burlington Northern-Santa Fe freight train ran two warning signals before plowing into the double-decker Metrolink passenger train. The freight engineer told police he was blinded by the sun and missed a crucial signal light.
The truck drove onto the tracks at a crossing where the gates were down and the signal lights were flashing. Authorities confirmed the signals were working at the time.
Twelve people were taken to hospitals and 20 others suffered minor injuries, Fire Department Battalion Chief David Starr said.
Ryan Schatz, 26, of Valencia was seated in the second car when it rolled over.
""I couldn't see what we hit ... I saw the fire go by and that was it,"" he said.

BURBANK, Calif. - A Southern California commuter train smashed into a truck Monday morning in a fiery rush-hour accident that killed the truck driver and injured 32 others, two critically, authorities said.
Witnesses said the crossing gates were lowered and the signal lights were flashing before the truck - a pickup or flatbed - went onto the track, the railroad said.
The 450-ton Metrolink train tore the truck in two, carrying some of the wreckage down the track while the rest exploded in flames.
The train was carrying 58 passengers and a crew of two from the Santa Clarita Valley to downtown Los Angeles, Metrolink spokeswoman Sharon Gavin said. The accident happened 10 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
The train had four passenger cars and an engine at the rear. All five cars jumped the tracks. One passenger car came to rest with one end sticking up in the air. Two cars fell onto their sides.
Ryan Schatz, 26, of Valencia was seated in the second car when it rolled over.
""I couldn't see what we hit. I saw the fire go by and that was it,"" he said. Some people were in shock, but ""there were quite a few people able to walk out.""
Fire Department Battalion Chief David Starr said 12 people were taken to hospitals and 20 others were treated for minor injuries. Two people were listed in critical condition. The identity of the truck driver was not immediately released.
Greg Peale, a witness, told KABC-TV that at the time of the crash, the gates were down and the signal lights were flashing.
The train's data recorder will be examined to determine speed and other information, Gavin said. Commuter trains typically reach no more than 50 mph in the area, Starr said.
It was the worst Metrolink accident since a freight train hit a commuter train April 23 in Placentia, killing two people and injuring more than 200.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2002 THE TIMES shreveporttimes.com Crash: Some want better markings at fatal crossing Continued from 1A A fifth teen-ager, Michael Starner, occupied the truck only minutes before the wreck. Shaw dropped Starner off at his residence, less than 100 feet from the railroad crossing, about 3:20 p.m. Thursday, 10 minutes after classes were dismissed. Shaw routinely took his friends home from school, recalled Jo Heller, who watched them load up in the truck while picking up her grandchildren. ""It was a normal thing.
Big Al (as Alan was called) would drop them off every day. They always looked like they were having fun."" Counselors on site The mood was understandably somber at Joaquin High on Friday morning as students, some visibly fighting back tears, arrived by bus or vehicle and were immediately ushered into the auditorium. Faculty stood in the hallway, offering hugs and Kleenex. Behind closed doors, Joaquin Independent School District Superintendent Phil Worsham talked about the accident. He wanted to make sure the students had factual information.
Staff counselors as well as others from neighboring school districts told students their reactions to their friends' deaths would vary from anger to crying, Worsham said. Counselors were available throughout the day, standing in the hallways or meeting one-on-one. Even the elementary school has counselors available, Worsham said. Karen Matthews, mother of Adam Matthews, is an elementary teacher. ""It's pretty traumatic when you have 160 in a high school with four individuals in an accident and three of those are deceased.
It's pretty tough,"" Worsham said. Classes were held as scheduled Friday; however, a softball game that afternoon was canceled. So is a Spanish club-sponsored Valentine's dance tonight. Next week, school officials will take it one day at a time. ""The whole community has experienced this.
It's a pretty big blow and we're very, very sorrowful for all of the families involved,"" Worsham said. Eleventh-grader Maranda Brewton said her classmates were doing OK. She preferred to remember the fun times with Alan, who she described as a ""big flirt,"" and Brad, someone she had known since the sixth grade. All of the students were asked to sign large posters that will be presented to the victims' parents. ""A lot started crying when they had to do that,"" Brewton said.
River cities share grief Like Shreveport-Bossier City, Joaquin and Logansport consider themselves almost sister cities. Most residents in both municipalities ignore the several miles and state line that officially separate them. The dis- Two unidentified students from Joaquin High School grieve as they walk along the railroad tracks Friday in Joaquin, Texas. MEGA MEGA Mark Rowlett, Joe Mark Regional Forecast For tance diminishes even more, however, when families known in both towns are hurting. From BB's Kitchen in Joaquin to Rusty's Diner in Logansport, the topic of conversation Friday was the deaths of the three likable high school teens.
Over a cup of coffee at Brenda Hennigan's Joaquin restaurant, Heller and Pat Suhr discuss the teens' deaths and their almost daily uneasiness of having 1 to cross over the same spot. Both live near the railroad tracks and both can recite the names of others who've either been killed, injured or survived crashes along the ambling 1 track. ""The Baptist and Methodist churches are on the other side of the tracks, and twice a day school buses go over it,"" Heller said. She and Suhr agree that too often local residents become complacent to the danger. ""That comes from taking it for granted,"" Heller said.
Across the river, hair stylist Jeri Parker of the Chop Shop in Logansport said talk in the shop has centered around the accident. She, like many of her customers, knows the victims' families. ""It's just been devastating,"" Parker said. Members of Logansport's First Baptist Church were spreading the word Friday afternoon of funeral plans. Joint services will be held there, where lifelong friends Matthews and Wiggins were members, at 2 p.m.
today; Shaw's service is at 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 p.m. Sunday at Haslam's First Baptist Church. ""They spent their first birthday together,"" Jody Matthews said of his nephew, Adam, and Wiggins. Wiggins would have celebrated his 16th birthday Sunday. Church member Leslie Turner said the youth group was coping with the loss as best it could.

Kenneth Blackwell survived. 14-year-old daughter Patricia participated with the rest of the group in an impromptu prayer session Thursday night. Robin Bagley, Blackwell Logansport High School counselor, Blackwell said students there were counseling, too.
Many knew the tims, either through school or munity related activities. ""It's a small knows community, everybody Bagley said. ""This affects our school and Joaquin's too. Our communities are meshed er."" Railroad worries Dennis Dale Freeman knew the Union Pacific trains rumbled in front of his house quite frequently. He didn't know just how often until he sat down and timed it earlier this week.
The result: a train every 17.5 minutes. ""I've literally cussed these trains, but I always keep a watch on them because of my teen-aged daughter. She crosses over the tracks every day,"" said Freeman. former emergency services worker, Freeman rushed from his home Thursday afternoon after he heard the train slowing and realized it had hit something. ""That distinct thud, that dead resonating thud,"" he said.
One of the victims was already dead, Freeman said, so he turned his attention to one of the others who was lying on the ground. ""I knelt and did what I could."" Another emergency responder, Jessie Griffith, also arrived on the. scene. His initial horror was slightly calmed after he realized his stepson, Michael Starner, was not with his friends. Starner, he said, is having a tough time right now.
""This is something he'll see every day,"" Griffith said of the deadly crossing. offered viccom- and other,"" high two togeth- But how many more need to die before the railroad crossing is improved, Griffith asked. Not only is the crossing unsafe, but the tracks themselves wobble and cause train cars to sway. And Griffith also believes most travel at unsafe speeds. He points to neighboring Logansport where the speed limit was posted at 35 mph.
""If they can slow down there, they can slow down here."" Griffith pledges to join students who have said they will push for a better crossing. ""If there had been an arm across that' road (Shaw) wouldn't have gone up there. What price do you put on a life?"" Unfortunately, Cooper said, a petition asking for an improved crossing failed to get anywhere in 1985. Town officials were told the cost was too high. Maybe this time will be different, he said.
Added Griffith: ""I told the students we are going to push this thing as far as we can."" Union Pacific to review locomotive event recorder By Larry Burton that was done.""

(KFSN) -- Three men are dead after an Amtrak train rammed into a pick-up truck Friday afternoon in Madera County.
The California Highway Patrol says the driver tried to bypass a stalled train at Avenue 9 and Road 33 and 1/2 when the deadly collision happened.
The men in a white pickup saw a freight stalled at the tracks and drove north to find an alternate crossing.
""I would believe that they presumed there were no trains coming due to the fact there was a stopped train a little ways back,"" Officer McConnell with the CHP said.
But there was an oncoming train and it collided with the pickup at the dirt crossing sending the vehicle flying into three pieces.
""You can see that the engine block is up in the vineyards, projected about 60 yards from the impact, the transmission was severed from the vehicle,"" Sgt. Lloyd Pratt with Madera-area CHP described. ""So, it was a very violent impact.""
Two of the victims were in their 20s while the third was in his 30s.
All were employed at a local farming company and were at work at the time of the crash.
""If you ever approaching an uncontrolled railroad crossing, you need to stop and make absolutely sure it is clear for an extremely long distance left and right,"" McConnell said.
CHP officers say this is the third accident involving a train to happen in Madera County this year. The other two didn't end in death because the trains were going at a slower speed.
This Amtrak, however, was traveling at 79 miles per hour.
""In this case there are no lights, there are no arms, it is incumbent on the driver to check both ways,"" Pratt said.

(KFSN) -- A train crashed into a stranded semi-truck near Chowchilla on Sunday afternoon, and the powerful impact was captured on a cellphone camera.
The collision happened shortly before 5 p.m. on Vista Avenue near Highway 99. The nearly mile-long Union Pacific train was carrying hundreds of military vehicles, mostly Stryker armored personnel carriers. Labels on the vehicles indicated they were being shipped from Ft. Lewis, Washington, to Fort Irwin, California, in the Mojave Desert.
A motorist named Tee Sae gave Action News the video of the crash. He was waiting at the rail crossing at Vista Avenue and Highway 99, saw the stranded truck and started taking video. It shows the truck driver walking down the tracks, frantically waving his arms to stop the train, but, as the video shows, the train kept on coming. The instant the train hit, the trailer of the semi exploded, sending its cargo, cardboard boxes full of plastic bags of trail mix flying.
WARNING: THIS VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC LANGUAGE.
On the other side of the tracks, on Highway 99, Robert Thissen was riding with his parents, using his cellphone to take video of the unusual train load of military equipment, when he saw what was about to happen, and on the video you hear him scream, ""Stop, Dad, stop...oh my God, we are going to die!""
A short time later, Action News caught up with Thissen in Chowchilla. He explained what was going through his head when he saw the impact.
""Is the truck going to fly into traffic in front of us? Is the train going to derail? Is there going to be an explosion?"" he said. ""The truck was right in front of us, maybe another five or ten seconds we would have been in this truck lane, we would have been destroyed, we would have been killed in this.""
The tractor of the semi rolled onto Highway 99. Ken McIntire said he was lucky to avoid hitting it in his truck.
""That was a pretty close call for me too, so I'm very thankful,"" he said.
Pieces of the demolished trailer were stuck to the front of the train, and boxes full of bagged trail mix were everywhere. The train was not damaged, and was able to move down the track within a couple of hours after the incident.

NOVATO -- A Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) train collided with a vehicle on the trackway in Novato late Friday morning, killing the vehicle's elderly driver.
The agency said the train, the southbound Trip 17, struck the vehicle at 11:20 a.m. near Hamiltion Parkway and Nave Drive just north of the Novato Hamilton station.
A patrol officer was within earshot of the crash when it happened and went to the scene and found the woman, Novato police said.
Investigators determined the SMART train was heading south when it hit the vehicle, which was going east and apparently went under the lowered crossing arms before being struck, according to police.
There were no injuries to any of the train's 28 passengers or crew members.
It was not immediately known why the vehicle was on the tracks when the train approached.
SMART said Trips 16 northbound and 17 southbound were canceled following the crash. A bus bridge was set up between the downtown Novato station and San Rafael stations, including the Civic Center and Novato Hamilton stations.
Trains were operating on schedule between the Larkspur and San Rafael stations, and the Novato Downtown and Sonoma County Airport stations.
SMART said passengers stranded by a canceled train can be reimbursed for an emergency ride by taxi, Uber, Lyft, or equivalent. More information for the Free Emergency Ride Program for Marin and Sonoma counties can be found at:

(KFSN) -- Family members said Edgar Roldan was an 8th grader who loved playing soccer and hanging out with his friends. He died Tuesday when he was struck by the train on Main Street.
Roldan was with a group of teenagers when they attempted to cross these tracks. The crossing arms were dropping and Roldan tried to make it, but he slipped and fell into the path of the train.
Tearful friends and teenagers stopped at the train tracks Wednesday where the athlete, once so full of energy lost his life. ""He was funny. And I don't know, I don't think anyone would picture him in this way,"" said Isabel Carrillo, victim's friend
""I think it's going to be really hard for the school too because he was one of the most popular kids, like one of the most popular kids,"" Alexis Coronado, victim's friend.
Friends say Roldan had just left Gene-O's Pizza Tuesday and was heading home before soccer practice when he and others walked and ran across the train tracks. ""He thought he could make it across. He started to run. He ended up slipping and I believe that's when he was struck,"" said Lt. Chris Soria, Livingston Police Department.
Roldan's brother was with him along with several friends. Investigators say at least one friend urged him not to cross, before witnessing in horror the train striking the teen and throwing him about 50 feet. ""For someone who is only 13-years-old and for his life to end like that. Being a parent myself, I can't even imagine what the family is going through,"" said Lt. Soria.
Roldan was the youngest of four children. Denise Aguilar said he was her boyfriend for the past six months. ""He was just nice. And a good person.""
During their time together, the two made a lot of great memories. ""We used to always go to football games and then they ended, so we didn't have nothing to do. So he would just come over and talk for a little bit.""
Officials with the railroad returned to the crash scene and spoke to at least one witness Wednesday morning. Since school is out for Thanksgiving break, many students are getting together to talk about the tragedy. One of the friends who was with Roldan Tuesday sent a text message to Aguilar expressing his sorrow and regret over his death. ""He just said that he is sorry for not being able to save him.""
An autopsy was done this morning and revealed Aguilar died of major blunt force trauma.

A woman died after a train hit the flatbed truck she was driving near Highway 183 and McFadden Road, just northwest of Salinas, according to California Highway Patrol.
Shortly after 1 p.m., Isabel Montes, 50, of Marina had turned from a private dirt road onto the railroad tracks toward Highway 183, authorities say.
It's not known if she'd stopped or gotten stuck on the tracks, CHP Officer Michael Orta said.
While on the tracks, the train hit her truck, which was carrying packaging materials for an ag company, he said.
The impact dislodged the driver's cabin and tore off the front tires and their axle, Orta said.
Officers arrived to find the crash had knocked the pickup into a nearby picket fence, but no other property damage has been found, he said.
Montes was pronounced dead at scene. The Monterey County Coroner's Office released her identity Thursday.
The collision also caused a fuel leak, which the Monterey County Regional Fire District cleaned up, Orta said.
The crash did not block Highway 183 but did slow traffic in the area for at least two hours after the crash was reported.
He didn't know which ag company she worked for, though Tanimura & Antle representatives were at the crash site. One of them declined to comment.
However, a door on the side of the truck's cab had the Tanimura & Antle logo on it.
The train, believed to belong to Union Pacific, was stopped several hundred feet to the west.
A Union Pacific officer was also on scene investigating.

locomotive
Morgan Hill – A 41-year-old Morgan Hill man was killed Thursday night as he allegedly tried to beat an Amtrak train in his vehicle but did not clear the tracks in time.
According to Morgan Hill police Sgt. David Swing, Rustom Ajlouni was driving northbound on Monterey Road at approximately 8:45pm as an Amtrak passenger train was traveling northbound on the tracks parallel to the road. As Ajlouni reached Tilton Avenue, he turned left to cross the tracks, ignoring the downed crossing arms and flashing lights and warning bells.
The train was traveling at approximately 70mph as it came through the intersection. It struck Ajlouni’s full-sized pickup broadside, and he was ejected. He was pronounced dead at the scene by medical personnel.
Swing said witnesses told the investigating officers that Ajlouni had been to a bar prior to the accident, so police believe alcohol may have been a factor in his death, but it cannot be determined if he was driving under the influence until toxicology tests are completed.
Amtrak spokesperson Vernae Graham said 182 passengers and crew were on the train, which left Los Angeles Thursday morning and was headed for Seattle. During the four hours the tracks were closed for investigation by MHPD officers, Union Pacific Railroad and Amtrak Police, the crew and passengers remained on board. When the tracks were clear, the train, passengers and crew continued to Seattle. The crew did not ask to be relieved, Graham said.
No one on the train, which was traveling 70mph in a 79 mph maximum speed zone, was injured, she said.
Ron Daniels, who describes Ajlouni as “almost a brother” to him, said Ajlouni’s family is “devastated” by the loss, particularly as they are still morning Ajlouni’s father, who died in Sept. 2005.
Daniels said though Ajlouni had a “heart of gold,” he sometimes “had a crazy side.”
“He would do anything for people, he was well-known and well-loved,” Daniels. “I am just devastated. He’s like my brother, we call each other brothers. He was someone who was a good friend, and someone who was a family guy.”
Having known each other since junior high school, Daniels said, he and Ajlouni grew up together, but the depth of their relationship was brought home to him when he, Daniels, had a major motorcycle accident in 2003 and lost a leg and an arm as a result.
“Of the three months I spent in the hospital after that, I think he missed visiting me maybe three days,” Daniels said. “He would bring me breakfast on Saturday mornings. He was there for me during a very difficult time, never let me down.”
Daniels said Ajlouni had moved in with his mother after the death of his father and was working as a carpet and linoleum layer for a friend.
Ajlouni’s two-year-old son was the “pride and joy of his life,” Daniels said. “Anytime he could spend with him, he took advantage of that. He wanted to be with him as much as he could.”
Swing said photos of the remains of Ajlouni’s truck illustrate the dangers of trying to outmaneuver a train.
“This is the aftermath, this is what happens,” he said. “This is the third train accident in nine months, the second in six weeks. We want the public to realize that the crossing arms are there for a reason. The train may be moving faster than it appears. We may think we can judge its speed, but it’s difficult because we’re used to judging the speed of much smaller vehicles. Patience is always the best route. Wait for the train to completely pass the intersection, for the flashing lights to stop flashing and the arms to raise before moving into the intersection.”
Jackie Gamboa was killed Jan. 23 when the truck she was riding in was hit by a Caltrain commuter train; her boyfriend, Nathan Schrock, was driving and went around another truck stopped at the crossing and around the crossing arms to bypass a freight train on one set of tracks, apparently unaware the commuter train was coming on the other tracks from the opposite direction.
On Sept. 6, Victor Sandoval was killed by a northbound Union Pacific freight train as he tried to jump the tracks in front of the train; the train clipped his rear leg as he leapt across, spinning him around into the train.

But, the Boston Globe reported at the time, something went horribly wrong. Somehow, the train accelerated rapidly. ""Automatic stops"" meant to stop runaway trains had been turned off for the night and while he was able to get through the first of two curves, when he hit the second, at Washington and Dudley streets, doing 60 to 65 m.p.h., his car caromed off the tracks - underneath which a trolley had just past - and down to the street. As soon as his car hit the ground, he was shot out of what used to be a window - after which ""a shower of torn steel, wood and glass"" fell on top of him as the second car came hurtling off the tracks as well and into the walls of a nearby building.
Amazingly, local police and bystanders were able to get Manning into an ambulance to City Hospital - where he was pronounced dead about four hours later.
The Boston City Archives has two collections of photos from the Dudley Street disaster, including:

If that happened today it would much worse. As a rider of the All Bad Orange Line, they already are breaking. Control Alt Delete. Tells people they are at Jackson when they are at Downtown. My head keeps hitting the emergency button each time the breaks slam. Seats are so fucking bad as well. Riding in a piece of tin.

""I think she has."" The final thing Thomas Manning is known to have said to another person, per a BERy internal report on the accident. The other man was wondering if the train had ""flat"" wheels {worn spots from excessive wear}. The report also noted that Mr. Manning had formerly been a streetcar motorman working out of Division Five {Southie}.
Accidents were extremely rare on the Elevated; the few that did occur were catastrophic.

Jessica McLoughlin, who died following the collision in Ballisodare last Wednesday, was laid to rest after a service at St Anne’s Church in Sligo on Monday.
Ms McLoughlin’s niece, Rebecca McLoughlin, 25, who was seriously injured in the incident, attended her aunt’s funeral on crutches.
Speaking to mourners, Jessica's brother Graham spoke out to the train driver and said: ‘We are sorry you are facing this burden through no fault of your own. We wish you love, support and strength at this difficult time’.
He remembered his sister - who turned 40 in January of this year - fondly and said she was a ‘beautiful’ woman, who was ‘funny, with a hint of crazy’ at her funeral service.
Graham said: ‘The fond memories you have left behind will stay with us forever. We wouldn’t change those memories for the world.
'We all would have hoped for a better outcome for you, Jess, but as you know all too well, sometimes life doesn’t go the way that you would like it to.’
Ms McLoughlin’s grieving brother also thanked the emergency services, ‘who made every effort possible’ to save his beloved sister.
A message on flowers left for Ms McLoughlin – who lived in Cranmore, Co. Sligo – read: ‘Jessica, we will miss you dearly. I wish you could have met your niece. We will tell her all about you.’
Ms McLoughlin is survived by her four children, Ryan, Kyle, Megan and Alisha. Father Pat Lombard, who led the funeral Mass, said that the accident had shocked the community.
‘There has been such an outpouring of goodwill these last days and I wish to acknowledge the kindness and goodness of so many who have sympathised, who have sent good wishes and who’ve offered prayers and have remembered,’ he said.
He added: ‘We are also indebted to the emergency services who so rapidly responded to Wednesday’s accident, as they do for every critical incident.’
In his homily, Fr Lombard welcomed Rebecca McLoughlin and told the congregation she was recovering well.
Fr Lombard also acknowledged the driver of the train involved in the incident. ‘May we also take this opportunity to send our good wishes and prayers to the train driver, who did all in his power to alert his presence on the line, and to all Irish Rail employees affected by the tragic accident,’ he said. ‘We don’t fully realise the difficulties of their work and the challenges that they face.’
A family photo was brought up to the altar to represent Ms McLoughlin’s love for her family. Attendees at the funeral included Sinn Féin TD for Sligo-Leitrim Martin Kenny.
Ms McLoughlin died after being struck by the train’s carriage steps, and the tragedy has been described as an accident. Irish Rail confirmed the train driver had been relieved of his duties for a compassionate period, given the trauma of the incident.
It also confirmed the driver had been offered counselling services.

Train Accident Statistics
Approximately 5,800 train-car accidents occur in the United States each year, with the majority occurring near railroad crossings. About 600 people die, and 2,300 are injured daily in these accidents, which occur on a regular basis.
At railroad crossings, more than half of all fatal accidents occur. This is mainly due to the absence of active safety mechanisms, insufficient safety measures, or even no security devices at all at these crossings.
When a train collides with a car during the day, approximately 75% of all collisions occur. A little more than half of the time, it happens at night. Cars are at risk of being hit by a train if a crossing is not clearly marked.
According to the Federal Railroad Administration, more than one-third of railroad crossings lack proper warning equipment.
Only 5% of all rail incidents in California in 2007 were due to mechanical breakdowns, whereas human error was responsible for 48% of all incidents. Collisions could be caused by issues specific to the railroad industry.
Most train accidents are caused by a lack of safety measures and inadequate security.

Horrifying pictures of bodies strewn on the tracks and a platform have emerged after the fire reportedly caused the train to derail.
The train was entering the main Ramses station in Cairo, the capital city, from Alexandria when the blaze erupted, according to local reports.
Shocking photographs show bodies charred by flames lying on the tracks and platform, with flames in the background and plumes of smoke billowing.
Inside the station, the train's blackened engine could be seen tilted to one side next to a platform full of terrified witnesses.
A dramatic video shows bright orange flames filling the station.
People appear to be trying to flee from the scene as panic spreads.
Eyewitnesses reported seeing people 'running while on fire,' 'corpses lying on the ground' and one shouting 'there are no brakes' from the train before jumping out.
Egypt's transport minister resigned following the deadly train crash, a cabinet statement said.
The prime minister accepted Hisham Arafat's resignation, the statement added.
A source claimed the fire had caused parts of the building to collapse.
Railway authorities have ordered the full evacuation of the station this morning.
Reports suggest the train crashed into a steel barrier on the pavement before flames ignited.
Security sources said there was no indication that the crash was deliberate.
The crash caused a fuel tank to explode, Sky News Arabia reports.
A witness said there was a blast when a train rammed into a barrier at Ramses station and said he had seen charred bodies on the ground.
""I was standing on the platform and I saw the train speed into the barrier,"" eyewitness Mina Ghaly told Reuters.
""Everyone started running but a lot of people died after the locomotive exploded.""
""I saw at least nine corpses lying on the ground, charred.""
Eyewitness Ibrahim Hussein said: ""I saw a man pointing from the locomotive as it entered the platform, and screaming 'there are no brakes, there are no brakes' before he jumped out of the locomotive.
""And I don't know what happened to him.""
Ahmed Abdeltawab said the platform had been crowded with people waiting for another train.
""The fire overwhelmed them and they ran while they were on fire until they fell metres from incident,"" he said.
""The scene was terrifying.""
Several witnesses said they had seen fire coming out of the train's engine before it crashed, causing an explosion and fires inside the station.
Authorities are working to control the blaze.
Dramatic images from the scene have been shared on social media as people express their shock and sadness.
""May God have mercy on the victims of Egypt station,"" one wrote.
Dr Hala Zayed, the Minister of Health, has gone to the Al-Hilal hospital to check on the condition of those who have been injured, Mobtada reports.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced from the station that the incident would be investigated and anyone found responsible held to account.
Egypt has one of the oldest and largest rail networks in the region and accidents causing casualties have been common.
Egyptians have long complained that successive governments have failed to enforce basic safety standards for the railways.
Student Ali Ramadan said he had suffered burns and injured his foot when he ran into a concrete bench on the crowded platform.
""I don't know when these train accidents will end. They told us they got millions of dollars' worth of new locomotives and trains, and people are still dying because of train accidents.""
The transport ministry suspended all train arrivals and departures at the station.

Dozens of people died when a train ran into a crowd watching fireworks during a religious festival in northern India, according to authorities.
Key points:
- People did not hear the train approaching amid the din of festivities
- At least 60 admitted to hospital in ""freak accident""
- The incident was among the deadliest rail tragedies in recent years
Railway police said 60 people died in a ""freak accident"" which happened when the sound of fireworks at the Dussehra festival on the outskirts of Amritsar made it impossible for people to hear the commuter train bearing down on them.
At least 50 injured people were admitted to hospital.
A witness said the train did not even sound its whistle as it sped past the site.
""Why did authorities allow the fireworks display so close to the railroad track?'"" he asked.
Punjab's Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said he was rushing to Amritsar to supervise relief and rescue operations.
""District authorities have been mobilised on war footing,"" he tweeted.
Local television stations showed images of angry and distraught locals, including a weeping mother who had just lost a child in the tragedy.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by the accident.
""The tragedy is heart-wrenching,"" he tweeted.
""My deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones and I pray that the injured recover quickly.""
Navjot Kaur Siddhu, a local Congress party politician who was the chief guest at the religious function, said the celebrations took place in the area every year, and railroad authorities were alerted to run the trains at slow speeds.
While accidents are relatively common on India's sprawling rail network, Friday's was among the deadliest in recent years.
In 2016, 146 people were killed when a train slid off railroad tracks in eastern India.

Sixty-one people were killed and more than 70 injured in the tragedy. Giving details, the railways said 10 mail/express trains and 27 passenger trains were cancelled. While 16 trains were diverted and reached their destination through a different route, 18 trains were short terminated, Northern Railways spokesperson Deepak Kumar said.
The route between Jalandhar and Amritsar was suspended, he said.
The railways maintained it had no information about the Dussehra function held near the tracks.
Chairman Railway Board Ashwani Lohani said in a statement that the accident occurred at a midsection between the Amritsar and Manawala stations and not at a level crossing. “There was no information and no permission sought from us. The event took place at a place adjoining the railway land in private property,” he said. “At midsections, trains run at their assigned speeds and people are not expected to be on the tracks. At midsections there is no railway staff posted. We have employees at level crossings whose job is to regulate traffic.”
According to Lohani, the gateman was 400 metres away at a level crossing. If the driver had applied emergency breaks, there could have been a bigger tragedy, Lohani added.

Organizers celebrated Dussehra at Dhobi Ghat based on verbal permission from railway crossing guards in Amritsar
New Delhi: Dussehra celebrations at Amritsar’s Dhobi Ghat have been a four-decade-old affair. Hundreds throng the place to see the fireworks as the effigy of Ravana is set on fire, celebrating the victory of good over evil. There was no complaint from the Indian Railways or locals over the choice of venue until Friday when train accident took place, killing 61 people.
But organizing the event at the small triangular ground with just two gates—one opening on the main road and the other facing the railway tracks, besides the open dias at one corner that doubled up as a platform for the Dussehra celebrations—was always a risky proposition. Organizers never cared to seek a written permission from either the district administration or the municipal corporation. Effectively, there was no prior arrangement to deal with any untoward incident. This time, too, it was no different. The public and the administration knew about the celebrations, but no one cared to find out if adequate safety measures were taken.
“Dussehra organizers generally tell the guards at the crossing to take care of the trains by closing the gates after 5-10 minutes—enough time for organizers to ask the public to clear the tracks before the train passes. This time, it didn’t happen,"" said Reshmi Kaur, a local resident who lives metres away from the track.
“When Ravana’s effigy was set on fire, the crowd spilled over to the tracks. Everybody was so engrossed in celebrations, music and in taking selfies that nobody cared about the train,"" Kaur claimed that many local residents were aware that the train was about to pass.
“When we used to organize, we would ensure barricading either through human chain or deploying of police. But this year, celebration was at a larger scale and so was the crowd,"" said a local politician, who used to organize the Dussehra programme on the same grounds, requesting anonymity.
He acknowledged that guards were asked to be on alert and organizers in the past used to make regular announcements to clear the tracks. “That is one reason why this kind of a tragedy has never happened before.""
The Railways denied that the guards at the level crossing were under pressure from local politicians or the Dussehra committee organizers.
“This is pure speculation and as you may appreciate the Railways cannot respond to speculations. I would appreciate if news organizations focus on credible, objectively verifiable facts in the light of this tragedy,"" said an Indian Railways spokesperson.
On the question why railway guards didn’t stop the train, Amritsar station master Amrit Singh said the guard’s jurisdiction is limited to the level crossing. If something is happening on tracks it’s purely his discretion if he wants to report it or not. Railways can’t hold them responsible.
Another senior railway official, requesting anonymity, said Indian Railways has 63,000km of railway track and there is no surveillance system on tracks. If a track is laid, it is railways’ property and not public property. If you come on tracks, it amounts to trespassing. Under the Railways’ rules, people who have been injured were trespassers and can be fined and punished. “It’s on humanitarian ground that Indian Railways don’t penalize them.""

At least 300 people were watching the burning of the effigy of Ravan, when some of them started moving towards the tracks, according to reports. The revellers may not have heard the approaching train because of the noise of the crackers, said local government officials.
“More than 50 casualties have already been identified and right now we are busy evacuating injured to the hospitals. As it is night there are some difficulties in evacuation operations,"" said a senior Punjab police official on condition of anonymity.
“As Dussehra celebration was taking place some incident had occurred and people started rushing towards closed gate number 27 while a DMU train number 74943 was passing the closed gate (between Amritsar and Manawala,"" a northern Railway spokesperson was quoted as saying.
The train was going from Jalandhar to Amritsar.
Punjab chief minister Capt. Amarinder Singh rushed to the site and announced a compensation of ₹ 5 lakh for those killed and free medical treatment for the injured.

Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Sunil Jakhar came down heavily on the Railways.
“What is surprising is the haste in which Indian Railways has given a clean chit to the train driver without following the standard operating procedure. Within the night, the minister of state for railways (Manoj Sinha) and the railway board chairman, Ashwani Lohani, declared that the railways was not at fault,” said Jakhar.
When a train accident takes place, the mishap is categorized and based on it an inquiry is ordered by the commissioner of rail safety, he said.
The Congress leader said that there were lapses on the part of the district administration and the public, but the railways too should inquire about its role in the mishap.
The railway officials are issuing contradictory statements raising several questions, Jakhar said. NextMAds
“There are several lapses. The driver said he applied emergency breaks but the train neither stopped nor slowed down according to the videos surfacing and eyewitness testimony. The train driver claimed that people were pelting stones. The train’s speed was so high and the accident happened in fraction of seconds. By the time people gathered senses and noticed what had happened it was out of sight,” said Jakhar.
The Congress leader alleged that either the railways was trying to hide something or it was a political conspiracy to pin the blame on cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament from Amritsar to join the Congress before the Punjab Assembly elections in January 2017 before the Punjab Assembly elections. Sidhu won the elections and became a Cabinet minister in the Punjab government.
“Let’s wait for a month and see what comes out from the Punjab government inquiry. However, even the railways should do a self-analysis to find out if they were at fault too,” Jakhar said.thirdMAds
The Congress leader said trespassing has been going for years in that area. “How many people have been fined by railways for trespassing in that area?” he asked.
Aam Aadmi Party Punjab leader Sukhpal Khaira created controversy by stating in a video that the accident is a small incident. In the video, which has gone viral across the state, Khaira said the news of the Amritsar train accident has got a lot of attention. Media organizations and various people across the country have reached the spot either for coverage or to try to help. “However, I want to say that such small incidents happen in India every day in fact in Punjab only,” Khaira is shown as saying in the video.
Following the allegations, the BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have decided to meet Punjab governor V.P. Singh Badnore on Tuesday under the leadership of former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal of the SAD. fourthMAds
The two parties are going to demand ₹ 1 crore compensation and a government job for a member of the families of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and ₹ 50 lakh for those injured. They will also demand a judicial inquiry into the incident by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high Court.
A senior Punjab BJP leader, however, said on condition of anonymity, “It was entirely the fault of the local district administration and local politicians who believe in verbal permissions. Had they followed the proper norms the tragedy could have been averted.”
Politicians should not play a blame game over the deaths now, the BJP leader said.
On Sunday, former Punjab deputy chief minister and SAD president Sukhbir Badal had demanded Sidhu’s resignation, claiming that the minister’s wife was responsible for the tragedy as she was the chief guest.
The Punjab government is, meanwhile, undertaking the socio-economic profiling of the victims to facilitate their rehabilitation on priority. The profiling is being done to identify beneficiaries for jobs, pensions, and educational support.

Train Derails In Nutley, Contaminated Soil Dumped Onto Tracks
The train's cargo of soil contained lead and PCBs when it derailed in Nutley, according to reports.
A Norfolk Southern Train tipped off the tracks and derailed on Nutley on Saturday, spilling a load of contaminated soil and leaving a mess for local emergency workers.
According to the Nutley Police Department, the derailment took place around 3 p.m. on Saturday as the train was crossing at the intersection of Hillside Avenue and High Street.
When police arrived on the scene, they reportedly saw several cargo containers leaning hazardously off the tracks, with one container completely overturned, according to a NPD spokesman.

Monorail Coral has been involved in a monorail accident at Walt Disney World. The accident happened on the express loop between the TTC and the Contemporary Resort. No guests were on board at the time.
The train collided with the work tug at a high enough speed to cause considerable damage to the nose cone. The glass from the pilot compartment was knocked out and damage to the fiberglass can be seen.

The good news is that no guests were on board. We haven’t heard if the pilot was injured, or even on board. We also don’t know the status of the tug pilot. It’s possible the tug was towing the unit at the time.
Update: Disney confirms the Monorail was being towed when it somehow became separated from the tug. It’s not yet sure why there was an error. No injuries are reported.
Other Disney sites are reporting that this train was part of a test of the Train Control System (TCS). The TCS will automate the monorails making them essentially driver-less similar to other regional transportation systems.
As a result of the accident, traffic is shut down on World Drive and pedestrians are being kept away from the area.

Woman Steps in Front of San Clemente Train
A woman died when she stepped in front of a train in San Clemente. The investigation into her death caused commuter delays for hours.
A pedestrian apparently stepped in front of an Amtrak train in San Clemente today and was killed.
The train slammed into the woman just before 1:25 p.m. and it appears to be a suicide, according to Orange County sheriff’s Lt. Jeff Hallock.
The train struck the woman in the 1800 block of Avenida Estacion, close to a Metrolink train station in the north beach area, Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi said.

The incident caused delays for hours as authorities worked the accident scene this afternoon, according to Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten. The tracks were cleared as of 4:30 p.m., but delays will continue through the night, he said.
“We’ll be playing catch-up for quite awhile with 30 minutes to an hour delays,” Lustgarten said.

Some passengers were able to break the toilet windows of the train, but other victims were overcome by the thick, swirling smoke and bodies were found heaped at the windows and doors, reports said.
“We were suffocating because we couldn’t get the windows open, the windows are really strong,” one young man who survived but who lost his cousin to the flames told India’s NDTV news.
Rescue officials said many bodies were charred beyond recognition and would have to undergo DNA tests to determine their identity.
“Rescue teams have so far recovered 26 bodies from the three-tier coach of the train while five of the eight injured have been admitted to hospital for emergency treatment,” South Western Railway spokesman S. Biswas told AFP.
Forensic teams were on their way to the train site to collect body samples for analysis, The Press Trust of India reported.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed “shock and grief at the loss of life in the train accident in Andhra Pradesh” in a statement on his official Twitter account.
The carriage was gutted by the inferno and was a mass of twisted metal and melted plastic seats. Adjacent coaches also bore scorch marks, testifying to the ferocity of the fire.
There were conflicting reports about the number aboard with police saying 65 while national railways minister Mallikarjun Kharge said there were 67 people in the carriage, sleeping six to a compartment.
Kharge told AFP the blaze was believed to have been caused by an electricity fault.
India’s underfunded, accident-prone rail network, one of the world’s largest, is still the main form of long-distance travel in the huge country despite fierce competition from private airlines.
The coach caught fire in the pre-dawn hours as it travelled from the high-tech city of Bangalore to Nanded, 300km from Hyderabad.
Two of those who died were children, railway officials said.
The exit doors of Indian trains are customarily locked at night, reports said, while the carriage windows are covered with bars, making escape all but impossible.
The toilet windows are the only ones that have no bars and the spaces and berths are narrow.
The tragedy comes a little over a year after another train accident in the same state of Andhra Pradesh killed 32 people and shone the spotlight again on the Indian rail network’s dismal safety record.
That train was also carrying sleeping passengers and was also attributed to an electrical fault.
It was not immediately known whether more bodies would be found, police said.
Initial relief efforts were hampered by winter fog, local reports said, while the first people to reach the blazing train carriage were from nearby villages.
Railways minister Kharge said the railway board chairman would lead an inquiry into the cause of the accident and a more complete report would be issued later.
The engine driver stopped the train when he spotted flames about an hour away from Nanded, a police officer was quoted on The Hindu newspaper website as saying.
Rescue workers brought out the bodies as the smoke abated.
The prime minister said he had told railway and state government authorities “to extend all possible help to the victims in rescue and relief operations”.
India’s worst rail accident was in 1981 when a train plunged into a river in the eastern state of Bihar, killing an estimated 800 people. AFP

NTSB investigation: Eastbound train hit stopped train; debris spilled onto westbound track
L. SAUCON TWP., Pa. — The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released new information on Saturday morning's Norfolk Southern train derailment.
According to the NTSB, preliminary information about the incident indicates that an eastbound Norfolk Southern train hit a second Norfolk Southern train that was stopped on the same track.
According to the NTSB, wreckage from the first train then spilled onto an adjacent track and was struck by a third, westbound Norfolk Southern train. This collision ultimately led to the derailment of ""an unknown number"" of train cars, the NTSB said.
There are no reports of hazardous materials being released at the scene or into the Lehigh River, according to the NTSB.
The NTSB says it will send a team of ""experts in train operations, signals & train control, mechanical systems, and human performance"" to the scene later on Saturday.
Norfolk Southern trains involved in Lower Saucon derailment, cleanup ongoing
BETHLEHEM, Pa. — The train derailment happened around 7:15 a.m. Saturday along the Lehigh River in Lower Saucon Township, near the 2200 block of Riverside Drive on Saturday.
""There was a diesel fuel spill into the Lehigh River from the accident and containment booms have been deployed,"" said Lower Saucon Police Chief Thomas Barndt.
Police said there was also a spill of polypropylene pellets. That is a type of plastic.
""There are currently no evacuations or hazardous material threat to the community,"" said Chief Barndt.
According to the NTSB, an eastbound train struck a stopped train on the same track.
The agency said the wreckage from the striking train spilled onto an adjacent track and then was struck by a westbound train coming in the opposite direction.
All of the involved trains are from Norfolk Southern, according to the NTSB.
""There were no reported injuries to the crews from the trains,"" said Chief Barndt.
In a statement, Norfolk Southern said in part:
""Our crews and contractors will remain on-scene over the coming days to cleanup, and we appreciate the public's patience while they work as quickly, thoroughly, and as safely as possible. We are always working to advance safety. We will investigate this incident to understand how it happened and prevent others like it.""
Officials said first responders will remain on the ground in the days moving forward.
Northampton County emergency management had previously done train derailment training following what had occurred in East Palestine, Ohio, last year, according to the county executive.
""I want to thank all of our first responders who truly are the heroes in this scenario,"" said Lamont McClure, Northampton County Executive.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said his administration is continuing to monitor the situation and is communicating with local officials.
Investigators have yet to say why the trains ended up crashing into each other.
Bethlehem Twp., Lower Saucon residents react to Norfolk Southern train derailment
L. SAUCON TWP., Pa. — People who live along both sides of the Lehigh River were awoken by loud crashing sounds in the Norfolk Southern train derailment.
Now, they have a lot questions they want answered.
""I heard this loud boom"", said Warren Seith, of Bethlehem Township.
""At first, I thought it was thunder,"" said Bethlehem Township Commissioner-At-Large Mike Hudak.
The sound was heard for miles.
""[I heard an] extremely loud boom, which was resonating even as I woke up, Hudak said.""
""[It sounded like] a big steel plate that got dropped, or something like that,"" said Seith.
Peter Shoemaker heard it differently.
""It sounded like garbage truck trying to get a dumpster unstuck from it's forks,"" said Shoemaker. ""Just rattling back-and-forth repeatedly.""
The sound drew hundreds of people to the head of the D&L walking trail.
""This is way worse than I thought it was going to be,"" said Shoemaker.
And what they saw was astonishing.
""I would just like to know how it happened,"" Hudak wondered.
""I've never seen anything like it. I've seen trains, come up and down these tracks all the time."" Seith said.
""I saw the red stop signals flashing,"" Hudak said. ""It was the first time I ever saw that in 14 or 15 years I knew right away something was going on.""
Now that the damage is done, residents wonder how the engine will be pulled out of the Lehigh river, and how long it will take to remove the train and clean up the mess.
""I am really curious to see how they're going to pull those engines out,"" said Shoemaker.
""I'm trying to think, 'How in the world are you going to get a crane big enough to pick up an engine and put it on the tracks?'"" said Seith.
""To get those craned out of here, I don't know what they're going to do. I'm sure they've done it before. Norfolk Southern is a big, capable company,"" said Shoemaker.
""You look at this and it's a miracle no one was hurt,"" said Hudak.
Investor group says Saturday's Norfolk Southern accident reinforces its call for new leadership
L. SAUCON TWP., Pa. — The Norfolk Southern accident in Northampton County on Saturday shows the need for change at the top of the railroad, an investor group said.
Ancora Holdings Group said the Lower Saucon Township wreck and earlier accidents reinforce the investor's call for new leadership.
Ohio-based Ancora has proposed new executives for the railroad along with candidates for the board of directors.
""Our proposed slate (of board candidates) and management team are unanimous in their view that Norfolk Southern must become a safer and more reliable railroad before it can ever reach its full potential,"" the Ancora statement said.
Ancora said Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Alan Shaw should be removed. Shaw was paid $13.4 million in 2023, including base pay, awards of stock and stock options. That was up 37% from 2022, when he took over as CEO in May.
69 News has contacted Norfolk Southern for comment.
On Feb. 3, 2023, a Norfolk Southern train wreck in East Palestine, Ohio, did not cause any injuries but led to the release of chemicals, a fire and evacuations.
No injuries were reported in the Lower Saucon wreck Saturday, and no residents were evacuated. Booms were set up to protect the Lehigh River from fuel and oil spills.
""An incident like this, which is drawing national news coverage and resulting in more embarrassment for the railroad, should put an end"" to the board's support for Shaw, Ancora said.
""It is all too common for people to see in the news that a Norfolk Southern train is at the center of a derailment or tragedy,"" Ancora said.
Ancora proposes former United Parcel Service executive Jim Barber Jr. as CEO of Norfolk Southern and Jamie Boychuk, formerly of railroad company CSX Corp., as chief operating officer.
On Feb. 26, Norfolk Southern put out a statement rejecting Ancora's nominees and the investor's ""short-sighted plan that jeopardizes sustainable shareholder value creation.""
Shares in Norfolk Southern are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NSC. The closing price Friday was $257.49, giving the company a market capitalization of $58.2 billion.
In the past 52 weeks, the shares have traded as high as $261.37 and as low as $183.09.
REACTIONS: Norfolk Southern train derails into Lehigh River
L. SAUCON TWP., Pa. — Reactions are pouring in after a Norfolk Southern train derailed into the Lehigh River Saturday morning in Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County.
Read statements below:
Norfolk Southern
""Norfolk Southern has responded to a derailment in Lower Saucon Township, PA. There is no threat to the public, no hazardous material concerns from the railcars, and no reports of injuries to our crew members. We appreciate the quick, professional response by local emergency agencies. Our crews and contractors will remain on-scene over the coming days to cleanup, and we appreciate the public’s patience while they work as quickly, thoroughly, and as safely as possible. We are always working to advance safety. We will investigate this incident to understand how it happened and prevent others like it.""
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro
""Our Pennsylvania DEP team is onsite and PEMA is coordinating closely with our emergency management partners at the train derailment in Northampton County.
There is no wider threat to the public. We’re continuing to monitor the situation and communicate with local officials and will keep the public informed.”
National Transportation Safety Board
""NTSB is investigating the collision and derailment involving three Norfolk Southern trains near Easton, Pennsylvania. Preliminary information indicates that an eastbound NS train struck a stopped NS train on the same track. The wreckage from the striking train spilled onto an adjacent track and was struck by a westbound NS train. The collision led to the derailment of an unknown number of cars. There are no reported injuries or release of hazardous materials. NTSB will be sending a team comprised of experts in train operations, signals & train control, mechanical systems, and human performance. They expect to arrive on scene later today.""
Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.)
""My team is in contact with @NTSB regarding today's derailment in Bethlehem to assess the damage.
How many more derailments do we need before the Senate finally passes my Railway Safety Act to hold companies like Norfolk Southern accountable?
I've been ready to vote YES.""
Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (Norfolk Southern investors group)
“We hope the crew and everyone in Lower Saucon Township are unharmed by yet another derailment of a Norfolk Southern train. Although our fiduciary obligation is to pursue optimal returns for the pensions, family offices and other clients who entrust us with their capital, nothing takes precedence over the health and well-being of individuals and communities. Our proposed slate and management team are unanimous in their view that Norfolk Southern must become a safer and more reliable railroad before it can ever reach its full potential. Following this latest derailment, we call for the immediate termination of CEO Alan Shaw and stand ready to engage with the Company about an orderly reconstitution of the Board and a transition to capable management with a track record of actually delivering on safety commitments.
It is all too common for people to see in the news that a Norfolk Southern train is at the center of a derailment or tragedy. It is only by the grace of God that preliminary reports indicate no fatalities are associated with this accident. Images of diesel-filled locomotives lying on their sides underscore the urgent need to replace the Company’s failed executive leadership and provide this railroad the fresh start it so desperately needs.
This latest incident, which follows other accidents and the tragic death of an engineer this year, has resulted in two locomotives tumbling down a riverbank just 50 miles outside of Philadelphia and 85 miles outside of New York City. A derailment of this nature could cause fuel to leak into the river and nearby soil, resulting in health risks for communities who drink from this water and inviting investigations from state and federal governments. American Rivers, a non-profit, states that the Lehigh River supports the drinking water supply of 15 million people. A derailment like this could also hurt near-term service quality on an extremely busy line that connects major cities. This latest chapter in a series of accidents, which have been downplayed by Norfolk Southern, leads us to believe that it is only a matter of time before Mr. Shaw’s approach results in another wholesale disaster like the one in East Palestine, Ohio.
This comes days after the Board arrogantly promoted management’s safety record and revealed a 37% year-over-year raise in total compensation for Mr. Shaw, resulting in pay of roughly $13.4 million. It also follows the Board’s sustained efforts to poison the well and peddle misinformation about our safety commitments to regulators, shippers, labor and the media. An incident like this, which is drawing national news coverage and resulting in more embarrassment for the railroad, should put an end to the Board’s unsustainable efforts to save a tainted CEO with no long-term future. How can anyone defend this?”
State Sen. Lisa Boscola (D-Lehigh/Northampton)
“Earlier this morning representatives from Norfolk Southern contacted my office to inform me of a train derailment involving three trains in Lower Saucon Township.
I can’t express my thanks to the first responders that jumped into action immediately to assess the situation and get to work cleaning up the accident.
I am thankful that it appears no hazardous chemicals were involved and that cleaning crews deployed boons to contain any diesel fuel from the engines. My office will remain in contact with Norfolk Southern and Northampton County to assist in any way possible on the clean-up.
I will also be looking forward to understanding what went wrong and how it can be avoided in the future. Moving materials by rail is good for the environment and a critical activity for our economy.
We must do everything we can to make the transport safe which means making the needed investments in our aging infrastructure.""
Train derails into Lehigh River; no injuries, evacuations, leaks reported
UpdatedLOWER SAUCON TWP., Pa. — Part of a Norfolk Southern freight train went off the tracks in Northampton County on Saturday. The derailment sent two locomotives down an embankment and partially into the Lehigh River.
The incident was reported around 7:15 a.m. near the 2200 block of Riverside Drive in the Steel City section of Lower Saucon Township.
During a news conference that was streamed live on WFMZ.com at 11 a.m., officials said that diesel fuel had spilled into the Lehigh River but that the spill had been contained. Polypropylene pellets were also leaking from one of the train's cars.
Officials said they believe three trains were involved in the derailment, but they did not say what caused it.
Norfolk Southern is on site and working to assess the situation.
No injuries were reported, and there was no hazardous materials threat to the public, officials said.
Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure and Lower Saucon Township Police Chief Thomas Barndt held a news conference at 11 a.m. Saturday to…
""Some of the cars that were derailed were marked as holding hazardous material, but they were empty,"" Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure said. ""Air monitoring is being conducted, all is at normal levels and there is no danger to the general public at this time.""
Two locomotive engines landed in the water, and several train cars were derailed, according to Michael Stamets, public information officer for the Nancy Run Fire Company.
Booms were placed around the locomotives to contain the spill of diesel fuel. ""There is no immediate danger, and the river will be fine,"" McClure said.
McClure, a Bethlehem Township resident, said he heard a ""boom"" around 7 a.m. and thought it was a derailment.
Saturday's accident raised the issue of the 2023 train accident in East Palestine, Ohio. That incident involved Norfolk Southern train cars carrying hazardous materials and led to evacuations.
This derailment is not going to cause that kind of problem, McClure said.
Lower Saucon Township Council President Priscilla deLeon lives less than a mile from the crash site. She also heard the crash at her Steel City home, where she has resided since 1985.
She said she has been concerned for years about water runoff weakening the soil beneath the train tracks.
""I heard a noise around 7 a.m. and thought it was thunder,"" deLeon said.
She said evacuating her neighborhood would be difficult.
""There are more than 250 homes in Steel City,"" she said, and the entrance to the neighborhood is a narrow road.
The county asked that people stay away from the site so emergency crews can do their job. Riverside Drive was closed at Hillclimb Saturday morning due to the derailment.
Norfolk Southern said in a statement, ""We appreciate the quick, professional response by local emergency agencies. Our crews and contractors are on-scene and developing a clean-up plan.""
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has also been notified about the incident.
Norfolk Southern operates 36,000 miles of track and operates more than 4,000 locomotives and 87,000 rail cars.
Shares in the company are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NSC. The closing price Friday was $257.49, giving the company a market capitalization of $58.2 billion.

Multiple cars derailed during the accident, in which two engines plunged down an embankment and one ended up partially submerged in the Lehigh River.
Upon their arrival at the scene, emergency responders assisted the train crew, who officials said were not injured in the derailment.
Lower Saucon Township Police and other officials held a press conference at Steel City Park at 11 a.m. Saturday to update media representatives and community members on their investigation.
In a press release, police said that a diesel fuel spill into the river that resulted from the accident is being managed with containment booms that have been deployed.
Officials said there is also a spill of polypropylene plastic pellets from one of the derailed cars, but stressed that there is no danger to nearby residents as a result of spillage of freight from the train.
“There currently are no evacuations or hazardous material threat to the community,” they said. “We request that everyone stay out of the area so first responders and Norfolk Southern personnel can continue to assess and work at the scene.”
Along with Norfolk Southern, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the state’s Fish & Boat Commission, Northampton County Emergency Management, Lower Saucon Fire Rescue, Bethlehem Township Volunteer Company No. 1, Nancy Run Fire Company, Freemansburg Fire Company, Dewey Fire and EMS, and the Lehigh County Special Operations Team were some of the responding agencies involved in the cleanup and investigation. It was not immediately clear what role federal agencies would play in the investigation, but the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) tweeted Saturday that it was sending a team to the crash scene.

As of early Saturday afternoon, Riverside Drive remained closed to traffic at Mathews Avenue, which runs along Steel City Park and intersects with Riverside Drive near the Steel City fire station.
The fire station was surrounded by fire trucks and other emergency vehicles late Saturday morning, with access to Riverside Drive beyond that point restricted and safety cones located in the road.
Steel City residents have long expressed concerns about the possibility of a train derailment, in part because Riverside Drive–which parallels the tracks–is the only road into and out of the village.
Several reported hearing a loud boom at the time of the derailment, which occurred as rain was moving through the area.
On the opposite river bank from where it occurred, at a Delaware & Lehigh trailhead in Bethlehem Township, area residents were stopping to get a clear view of the massive train car entanglement.
Authorities did not release details about plans for how the engine would be pulled out of the river, or how long the cleanup might take. However, in the meantime both rail and vehicular traffic through the area will continue to be affected.

The screeching sounds of heavy metal tearing apart wood railroad ties and thick pavement scared some witnesses, as the trailing tank car veered 15 to 20 feet off the tracks and damaged five vehicles parked next to the Post Office.
The derailed train then chopped down a metal crossing cantilever over South Washington Street. That’s where the last two cars came to rest, blocking South Washington Street from 9:20 a.m. through at least Friday afternoon.
Sonora Police Cpl. Thomas Brickley said the estimated time for reopening South Washington Street was 7 p.m. Two Caterpillar bulldozers on tracks were among the heavy equipment being used to move the derailed train cars.
Ken Beard, chief executive officer of Sierra Northern Railway, said in a phone interview Friday afternoon that the cause of the crash remained under investigation.
At 10 a.m. Friday, about 40 minutes after the derailment, a pink piece of plastic tape with “57 ½” and “Drainage Issue” handwritten on it lay on the tracks where one rail began to wrench free from its moorings about 100 yards uphill from the Post Office.
Beard said the tracks in that location were first put in back in 1897, though they have been upgraded multiple times over the past 126 years and are on a schedule to be upgraded again.
“We got a grant to upgrade from Riverside to Standard,” Beard said. “About a month ago, our track inspectors walked the whole line out there.”
The inspectors marked that area for improving the 57 ½ inch gage to a standard 56 ½ inch gage, Beard said. The railroad cars used on the line can run on gages from 56 to 58 inches wide.
Linda Darby, 63, of Sonora, saw and heard the derailment without realizing at least one tank car was completely off the tracks as it passed her vehicle on Hospital Road.
“I was just waiting here for the train to pass,” Darby said. “It was near the end of the train I saw all this smoke. I thought it was smoke. You couldn’t see through it. I didn’t want to breathe it. It was squeaking pretty loud, it sounded like metal on metal. And then all these people were coming out here looking and I thought ‘what are they looking at.’ The last car came by making all this noise and I didn’t even realize it was off the tracks.”
Anthony Hernandez, of Avery, was at work at the Sonora Post Office when it happened. He didn’t see it, but he ran outside when coworkers outside loading packages into trucks began shouting, “Oh snap, the train’s derailing! The train’s derailing!”
“I came out and my car was already messed up,” Hernandez said of the used 2020 four-wheel-drive Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport he’d just bought in August, which he estimates is now totaled. “It’s the only vehicle I own for my family.”
Hernandez’ Jeep got dragged 20 to 30 feet from its legal parking spot on Hospital Road and smashed into a sign in the Post Office front parking lot on South Washington Street.
By 11:15 a.m. Friday, Hernandez had spent nearly two hours solid on the phone with insurers, trying to get his claim in and secure a tow truck and a replacement rental vehicle.
Post Office employee Reggie Van Sleet was inside working when he heard coworkers start talking about a derailment.
“A friend of mine came running in and he said ‘Reggie, your truck’s destroyed. A train just derailed.’ I thought he was joking,” Van Sleet said. “It was chaos out here. My truck, the red one, was sitting right up in front of the intersection.”
His Chevrolet Avalanche got battered and pushed more than 50 feet from where it was parked. The wheels of the trailing derailed tank car left distinct cuts in the pavement of Hospital Road from the point it derailed along its path veering 15 to 20 feet from the tracks, to where it came to rest on South Washington Street.
Postal worker Charity Stevens said she was out on her route delivering packages when a coworker called and told her about the derailment and told her that her vehicle parked on Hospital Road did not get hit. She was relieved.
“Mine’s good. Whew!” Stevens said. “I’m sorry for everybody else. I’m glad no one was hurt. That’s crazy it derailed because it doesn’t seem like it goes that fast through here. They come through every day. Usually lumber. Maybe 5 miles an hour. They blow their horn really loud.”
Beard said the company has insurance to cover such damage to private property.
David Rupert, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service, said that the Sonora Post Office would be fully operational Saturday and all routes would be delivered. He asked people to consider using an alternate location if they need to mail something out to avoid impacting emergency workers or delivery service.
Sonora Mayor Mark Plummer praised the city fire and police departments’ response to the derailment. He walked the section of tracks that came apart within an hour of the derailment and said it was fortunate that the tank cars were empty, because they are used to carry propane.
Sonora Fire Capt. Brittan Gregory said the train contained four flat cars loaded with covered materials and four tank cars directly behind them. Beard said the flat cars were hauling lumber.
Beard said the company typically runs trains through Sonora three to four days per week during the winter due to the increased demand for propane. He said they mainly haul lumber during the summer a couple days per week.
Derailments on the Oakdale-based company’s tracks are rare, Beard said, but the previous two wetter-than-normal winters have caused more issues than they’ve typically seen in the past.
“The ground gets soft, the ties get soft and it’s hard to hold the rail engaged,” he said.
The company previously had a minor derailment of an empty tank car in Jamestown on March 16 last year. That incident caught attention because it occurred a little over a month after a Norfolk Southern Railway train carrying hazardous materials derailed in Ohio and caused a massive environmental disaster that forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents in the nearby town of East Palestine.
According to federal data, as many as three trains derail per day in the United States, with half of those carrying hazardous materials, though relatively few cause disasters such as the one seen in Ohio.
Beard noted that Sierra Northern Railway is currently in the midst of a six-year plan to rehabilitate the entire 55-mile freight line of railroad tracks between Riverbank and Sonora.
In June 2019, the Modesto Bee reported the company received a nearly $17.4 million federal grant for the nearly $36 million project that will involve new ties, rails and road crossings. The rest of the cost would be covered by the company, the Bee reported.
The Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors voted to support the company’s original grant application for the project in 2017.

Twenty cars of the 212-car train derailed while heading southbound near the town of Springfield, Norfolk Southern spokesperson Connor Spielmaker told CNN. No injuries were reported.
Representatives from Norfolk Southern, the Environmental Protection Agency and a Clark County hazmat team each independently examined the crash site in Clark County and verified there was no evidence of spillage, Springfield Township Fire Chief Dave Mangle said at a news conference.
Two of the derailed tankers contained residual amounts of diesel exhaust fluid, another two contained polyacrylamide water solution and four were carrying with non-hazardous materials, according to Mangle.
Officials determined the derailment was not in an area with a protected water source, ""meaning there is no risk of public water system or private wells this time,"" Mangle added.
The derailment happened around 5 p.m. ET and the road was closed on State Route 41, an Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesperson told CNN.
""No hazardous materials are involved ... Our teams are enroute to the site to begin cleanup operations,"" the Norfolk Southern spokesperson said earlier Saturday.

The Clark County Emergency Management Agency asked residents Saturday who were within 1,000 feet of the train derailment ""to shelter-in-place out of an abundance of caution."" The order was lifted early Sunday morning after officials determined there was no risk to public health, Mangle said.
US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said earlier that he has been informed of the derailment, spoke with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and is sending Federal Railroad Administration officials to the scene.
""I have been briefed by FRA leadership and spoke with Gov. DeWine to offer our support after the derailment today in Clark County, Ohio. No hazardous material release has been reported, but we will continue to monitor closely and FRA personnel are en route,"" Buttigieg said in a tweet on Saturday.
The derailment comes as crews were still working to clear the toxic wreck of another Norfolk Southern train that derailed on February 3 while carrying hazardous materials more than 200 miles away in East Palestine, Ohio.

The East Palestine derailment fueled outcry among residents who have complained of symptoms, including headaches and coughing after the fiery crash. The train was hauling dangerous chemical vinyl chloride -- which was released and burned to prevent a potentially deadly explosion -- and other chemicals that are feared to have leaked into the surrounding ecosystem.
Norfolk Southern has promised to fully clean up the wreck and vowed to invest in East Palestine.
The derailment has put rail safety under the spotlight and raised questions about regulations surrounding the transport of hazardous materials. Data from the Federal Railroad Administration Office of Safety Analysis shows there have been at least 1,000 derailments in the United States each year during the past decade.

Train Crash Statistics
The National Transportation Safety Board reports that trains collide with people or vehicles every two hours. It is estimated that thousands of people die in train accidents each year. A total of 600 people were killed, and 2,300 were injured.
The National Transportation Safety Board reports that pedestrians are more likely to die in train collisions than car collisions. Approximately half of all train accidents are caused by dangerous crossings, inadequate warning systems for motorists, and insufficient safety features.
Since 1997, over 7,200 people have died in train accidents in the United States. Pedestrian collisions with trains are the leading cause of death on American railroads.
Trains are the most efficient means of transportation. Several factors contribute to the safety of employees and passengers, including the conductor’s skill and the maintenance frequency. Their actions may cause an accident if they take unsafe shortcuts or are irresponsible.
In addition to derailments and worn-out tracks, lax security, disregard for safety regulations, and disregard for safety rules are some of the reasons behind train accidents.

Investigators said an unfortunate combination of circumstances contributed to the train crash at Parkwater two days earlier.
Six railroad workers were dead, including the engineers of both trains.
The foreman of the switching crew admitted that “the custom was to hold the work train at Parkwater until the No. 41 had passed.”
On the fateful day, however, he had been told, correctly, that the No. 41 was more than an hour behind schedule. He testified that he believed the work train had “nearly a quarter of an hour” of leeway until the No. 41 passenger train came through. So he allowed the work train to be switched onto the main track. In fact, the No. 41 was not quite as late as the foreman thought.
Investigators were also trying to determine if the No. 41 was traveling at excessive speed when it approached Parkwater. There were some indications that engineer O.W. Southern was attempting to make up lost time.
The engineer’s widow said his last words before he left for work were, “I’m tired of getting jacked up for being late; I’ll bring her in on time tomorrow or bust!” Yet she added that No. 41 had “the clear right of way.” on that track.
The striking shopmen’s union suggested the accident was the result of lax maintenance and safety procedures because of nonunion replacement workers. The union recommended that investigators find out whether the passenger train’s brakes were defective and whether the switch engine’s headlight was missing or defective.

Fatal Train Accident Statistics
It is not always the most cost-effective or the most efficient mode of transportation in the city. There has been a recent uptick in the number of people hurt and killed as a result of travel.
Accidents involving trains are not uncommon in any part of the country. According to the Department of Transportation, there are approximately 5,800 train-car collisions that take place in the United States each year. At railroad crossings, you’ll see them the most frequently. As a result of these incidents, 600 people lost their lives, and another 2,300 were injured.
According to the Federal Railroad Administration, approximately 80 percent of railroad crossings in the United States do not have adequate warning devices (FRA).
Train derailments, poorly maintained tracks, a lack of safety regulations, and inadequate security are the primary contributors to the vast majority of train accidents.

By JOSH FRIEDMAN
The girl struck and killed by a train in Paso Robles on Monday has been identified as 13-year-old Genesis Guerrero.
Shortly before 4:30 p.m., a northbound Coast Starlight train struck Guerrero while she was walking southbound with a group of friends near the 3600 block of Riverside Avenue. Officers arrived to find the teen under the train. It is unclear what the children were doing in the area of the tracks and why Guerrero did not move away from the approaching train in time.
Guerrero was a student at Flamson Middle School in Paso Robles. On Tuesday, the Flamson campus mourned the 13-year-old’s death, and counselors assisted grieving students.
A GoFundMe campaign has been launched to raise money for a funeral and/or memorial for Guerrero. As of Wednesday morning, the GoFundMe has raised more than $12,000.
“On 2/7/2022, our daughter lost her life in a tragic accident,” the GoFundMe page states. “We are going to try to raise as much as we can so that we and all the family can give her a beautiful goodbye, the goodbye that she deserves. Anything is appreciated and we wouldn’t be able to thank you enough.”",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,02/07/2022,4:30 p.m.,Unknown,California,Monterey,CA,Paso Robles,3600 Riverside Avenue,K,Unknown,2,Unknown,C,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Joshua Friedman,Unknown,"February 9, 2022"

PASCO, WA (May 27, 2020) – Saturday evening, Christian Castillo-Naranjo died in a train crash near Columbia River in Pasco.
At 6:30 p.m. on May 23, the railroad employees received a report of a body found on the tracks. Then, they reported the incident to emergency dispatchers.
According to reports, Christian Castillo-Naranjo’s body was found on the Pasco end of the railroad bridge. The said area is near the Columbia River, just east of the cable bridge.
The police revealed that the 16-year-old boy was wearing a skull mask with hood. During that time, the authorities weren’t able to determine his identity. Hence, they asked the public’s help.
The Identity of the Deceased
By Monday, a family member identified Christian Castillo-Naranjo who was said to be suffering from depression.
Also, McGary stated that they will not conduct any autopsy since it’s obvious that Christian Castillo-Naranjo died from a train crash. He added that the incident was a possible suicide.
The authorities are also asking anyone with information about Christian Castillo-Naranjo’s death to contact dispatch at 509-628-0333 or email Detective Bill Wright at [email protected].
To the grieving family of Christian Castillo-Naranjo, our deepest sympathies go out to you and your family. May God give you the comfort and peace that you seek and may the soul of your loved one rest in peace.

RAIB has today released its report into a child nearly falling through a missing toilet floor, South Devon Railway, 22 June 2017.
Summary
At around 13:15 hrs on Thursday 22 June 2017, a mother and her three-year-old child were travelling on a South Devon Railway train from Totnes (Riverside) to Buckfastleigh. Shortly after leaving Staverton station, while the train was travelling at about 20 mph (32 km/h), the child left his seat and went towards a toilet on the train, followed by his mother walking a short distance behind.
The child entered the toilet, and as the door opened and the child stepped through it, he fell forward because the floor was missing in the compartment he had entered. A more serious accident was only prevented by the quick reaction of the mother who grabbed the child’s arm and prevented him falling through the opening and onto the track below. The child suffered minor bruising, and both mother and child were shocked. The accident was reported immediately to the railway company, but the RAIB was not advised of what had happened until 25 June 2017.
In April 2017 the South Devon Railway had carried out a repair to this carriage. The location of the repair was difficult to gain access to and required the floor of the toilet cubicle to be removed. The railway’s management decided that the door would be secured and notices placed on the door, allowing the carriage to enter service with the toilet floor missing. The RAIB found that the method of securing the door was inadequate, so that over time the door became less secure to the extent it was possible for the child to open it. The risk associated with the absence of the toilet floor was not sufficiently appreciated nor adequately managed after the carriage was allowed to enter service. The RAIB also found that the South Devon Railway had no formal competence management assessment for staff involved in carriage maintenance. Both of these factors led to no-one detecting that the door had become unsecure.
The RAIB observed during the investigation that the South Devon Railway’s maintenance regime did not identify the extent of the deteriorating condition of the carriage structure, and the railway’s fitness to run process was not being correctly applied.
Recommendations
The RAIB has made one recommendation to the South Devon Railway to commission an independent review of the actions it has taken since the accident to address the deficiencies in its processes.
The RAIB believes that the investigation has also identified an important lesson likely to be applicable to other heritage railways, about applying appropriate standards for vehicle maintenance, to ensure that the examination regime which they have in place will identify the foreseeable deterioration of vehicles, before it reaches a stage that may affect safety.
Simon French, Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents said:
Britain’s heritage railways carry over 9 million passengers every year. People are travelling for pleasure, and they don’t expect any nasty surprises during their journey. When a mother, enjoying a happy day out with a small child, is suddenly faced with a life-threatening hazard, it is important to find out what went wrong. A door opened - and she had to grab hold of her little boy to stop him falling through a gaping hole in the floor of the carriage.
Operating even a small railway involves dealing with significant risks. Carriages built sixty or more years ago need looking after to keep them both clean and welcoming, and safe for passengers to ride in. Maintenance involves inspecting the condition of the vehicle, including the hidden parts that are hard to get at, at regular, appropriate intervals. It needs to be properly planned, and backed up with prompt action when something needs fixing.
In this case, the railway company took out the toilet floor, to get at and fix a leaking brake pipe. The engineers found a lot of previously undetected rust and rot, that was going to have to be dealt with. It seemed like a good idea to seal up the toilet door until the whole carriage could be got into the workshops for overhaul, but that was not easy to do securely, and the door came open.
Our investigation found that the railway’s safety management system was not operating properly, and had not been reviewed for many years. A flawed management structure contributed to poor decision-making. Staff were expected to do jobs which they were not really qualified for. We have recommended an independent review of how the railway manages the safety of its operations. I hope that the rest of the Heritage Railway sector will also look carefully at this report, and take action to make sure that the same thing cannot happen on their railways.
Notes to editors
- The sole purpose of RAIB investigations is to prevent future accidents and incidents and improve railway safety. RAIB does not establish blame, liability or carry out prosecutions.
- RAIB operates, as far as possible, in an open and transparent manner. While our investigations are completely independent of the railway industry, we do maintain close liaison with railway companies and if we discover matters that may affect the safety of the railway, we make sure that information about them is circulated to the right people as soon as possible, and certainly long before publication of our final report.

A week ago, Fredzania Thompson saw the tracks as the perfect backdrop for a photoshoot to launch her modeling ambitions.
""I actually talked to her that morning,"" recalled fiancé Earl Champman. ""She told me she was headed to the photo shoot.""
That short conversation would be the last time Chapman would ever speak to Thompson, just 19 years old.
Hours later, he would learn that his fiancée, who was pregnant with the couple's first child, was hit by a train in the midst of the photoshoot.
""The photographer said she was moving,"" recalled Akamie Stephenson, mother of Thompson. ""She was actually off the tracks. But she didn't move far enough, and it hit her.""
Authorities say Thompson was standing between two sets of tracks Friday in Navasota when a BNSF Railway train approached.
Eyewitnesses told Stephenson that her daughter saw one train coming and moved out of the way. She did not realize in doing so, she moved in front of another train coming from the opposite direction.
""I'm very hurt about the situation because she was so young, but this is what she wanted. She wanted, to become a model,"" said Stephenson.
Monday evening, friends of the teen gathered for a vigil next to the tracks where Thompson was hit. She would have turned 20 years old.
""Just getting started, planning our life,"" said Chapman.
The investigation into the accident is ongoing. Authorities will examine the onboard video from the train that hit Thompson as part of the process. Thompson's mother worries that the stilettos her daughter was wearing may have slowed her efforts to run away from the oncoming train.
Her family has set up a GoFundMe for her funeral expenses.

Senior Jon Gregoire dies after being struck by train on restricted trestle
Jon Gregoire, a 21-year-old Liberty University senior, died Saturday, Nov. 8 around 4 p.m. after being struck by an oncoming train on a trestle behind Riverside Park in Lynchburg.
Gregoire, of Wilbraham, Massachusetts, was majoring in business administration-marketing with a certificate in Bible, according to a university news release. Gregoire also served as a prayer leader and was planning to become a missionary, the release stated.
“Jon will be terribly missed by so many at Liberty University,” President Jerry Falwell said in a statement released Sunday evening. “He was known and loved for his adventurous spirit and his spiritual depth. … His last Facebook post on Oct. 30 reflected on how God and Jesus Christ gave life its ultimate meaning. The Gregoire family will be held up in prayer by the entire Liberty University community.”
According to Samuel Dye, an RA on floor six of the Commons Dorm where Gregoire lived, Gregoire was a godly friend and mentor who left an impact on many people in the Liberty community.
“He was just such an encouragement to me,” Dye said. “I was his RA, but I looked up to him spiritually. He loved God so much. He loved people. … He was an incredible guy. … Anyone that knows Jon knows that he is legitimately one of the nicest people you’re ever gonna meet.”
Dye said Gregoire showed genuine care for everyone around him and showed Christ-like love.
“Everyone that I’ve talked to absolutely loved the guy, because he loved them, and he made that very clear through his actions, through his words,” Dye said. “… I’m never gonna forget him. I’m never gonna move on from him. I’m always gonna remember the way he loved people, the way that he just made people feel special. Every person, he made them feel important and special and loved. And that’s something that I want to emulate, because he’s emulating Christ.”
Junior Scotty Schafer, who was a member of Gregoire’s prayer group, explained Gregoire’s influence as he served on hall leadership.
“(T)he fact that Jon spent his junior year off campus and moved back onto campus this year feeling that God wanted him to come back on campus as a prayer leader means a lot to me,” Schafer said. “I think it shows that Jon was really looking for God’s direction in his life, and he wanted to serve (God) and do what God wanted him to do. … Jon was, I think, what every prayer leader could be and should be. He was intentional. He cared about us. He loved us. He led by example.”
In addition to serving as a prayer leader, Schafer said Gregoire always looked for ways to encourage others.
“Jon was very outgoing,” Schafer said. “… He was very focused on … (trying) to say hello to everyone. He was good at remembering people’s names. He smiled a lot. He interacted a lot with a bunch of people in great ways, particularly with guys on the hall.”
Schafer added that seeing Gregoire’s example of love for God pushed him to strive after the Lord in the same way.
“If I could live half of how Jon lived, I feel like I could be content. I feel like I would be serving Jesus well, ” Schafer said. “… If I loved Jesus half as much as Jon loved Jesus, I feel like I’m doing pretty good.”
Freshman Isaac Shubert III, who was also a member of Gregoire’s prayer group, affirmed that Gregoire became more than just a hall mate to the men of Floor Six.
“Jon was a man after God’s heart,” Shubert said. “… When I (saw) him, I (thought), ‘That’s what I wanna do. That’s what I want to be.’ … He did things a brother would do, not just as a friend. He went past a friendship. He saw me as his little brother, took care of me, made sure I was OK, always checked on me, gave me inspirational phrases or inspirational words from scripture. … I respected him a whole lot.”
The men and women who lived on Gregoire’s floor held a special worship session Sunday night, Nov. 9 to honor Jon and support one another in the grieving process.
Gregoire’s parents flew in to participate in a candlelight vigil, which was held at 8 p.m. Monday at the front steps of DeMoss Hall.
According to the Liberty news release, the Campus Pastors team is currently meeting with students affected by the tragedy, and counseling is available through Liberty’s Student Counseling Services.
Victoria Bridges, a 21 year old from Newport News, Virginia, was also injured in the accident. Bridges was released from Lynchburg General Hospital by 11 a.m. Sunday after being airlifted immediately following the event, according to an article in the News & Advance. Bridges was not a Liberty student.
Although it is unclear how many others were with Gregoire and Bridges at the time, no one else was injured.
Saturday’s accident marks the second train-related death of a Liberty student in the past three years. In November of 2011, freshman Hannah Williams was struck and killed by a train at the same trestle.

NEW ORLEANS – A train conductor was seriously injured and an engineer suffered minor injuries when a freight train hit a truck Sunday in northeast Louisiana, derailing two engines and 17 cars, according to Union Pacific Railroad Co.
The conductor’s injuries were not considered life-threatening, Union Pacific spokesman Jeff DeGraff said. He said the conductor was airlifted to a hospital in Shreveport – about 120 miles west of Mer Rouge, where the accident occurred Sunday afternoon – and the engineer was taken to a local hospital.
“Out of concern for the privacy of our employees, we are not releasing their names,” DeGraff said in an email.
Both were in a locomotive that overturned and slammed into a big oak tree, Mer Rouge police Chief Mitch Stephens said. He said the locomotive ended with its main door facing the ground and rescue crews had to pry off an access door to get to the two.
Stephens said about 50 houses were evacuated for about two hours due to concerns that a tank car of pressurized argon gas might explode. Another tank of argon, an inert gas used to fill light bulbs and in arc welding, leaked until it was empty, he said.
Stephens said the trailer got stuck on the tracks crossing Highway 165, but trucker Daniel Shackleford, of Freedom, Missouri, was unhurt. Shackleford was hauling a rig owned by Taylor Truck Line of Northfield, Minnesota.
“He saw the train coming and he jumped out of the truck,” Stephens said.
The train was hauling 87 cars, DeGraff said.
The police chief said the transport trailer got caught on the tracks.
“It was a lowboy. We’ve had this occur numerous times in the past, where trailers would get hung up on tracks,” he said.",Union Pacific Railroad Co.,Taylor Truck Line,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Caddo Parish,LA,Unknown,Highway 165,B,Unknown,Unknown,1,D,Car Unit in Train,1,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,87,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Jeff DeGraff, Union Pacific Railroad Co.

The MBTA train collision that left the operator of one of the trolleys dead last night, saw no other serious injuries, according to Newton-Wellesley Hospital.
Seven passengers were transported to Newton-Wellesley Hospital with “serious, but non-life threatening injuries” and one was airlifted, according to MBTA officials.
Newton-Wellesley Hospital spokesman Rachel Kagno said today that all patients involved in the train accident yesterday who were transported to Newton-Wellesley Hospital have been treated and released.
Terrese Edmonds, 24, had been working for the MBTA for nine months.
The accident occurred at 6 p.m. between the Waban and the Woodland stations and resulted in the derailment of both trains. Multiple ambulances and emergency crews responded as news helicopters hung in the air above and onlookers crept hesitantly through people’s backyards, looking for a better view.
According to passengers who were waiting to be transported from Brae Burn Country Club, one outbound train was at a standstill, when the other crashed into it.
“People flew out of their seats,” said Framingham resident Joe Collins, who was riding the train to Riverside, when his train hit the one in front of it. “Everything started shaking.”
Worcester resident Jill Davidson, who was also on the train, said, “There were screams coming from the front car. But I didn’t know what happened until 15 minutes after.”
Most of the passengers that were on the train when the accident occurred were transported to Riverside in another train. A few passengers were stranded for nearly an hour at the Brae Burn Country Club.
Susan Waldman, who lives behind Brae Burn Country Club on Windsor Road, said she was sitting at her table when she heard a “horrific crash.”
“There seemed to be a big gap between the sound of the collision…and the first ambulance,” she said. “I almost thought the two were unrelated. It could’ve only been five minutes, but it was so quiet after the crash.”
Waldman described what she heard as an “explosive sound, then a crunching metal sound.”
“I did hear screeching, but we often hear a squeaky sound,” she said.
Waldman said a neighbor of hers on Windsor Road saw sparks flying up from the area of the tracks.
Thirteen-year-old Simon Korn, who lives around the corner, was getting out of the car when he heard one long, loud crash.
“We didn’t think anything of it [until] we started hearing one or two sirens after a minute and a half,” he said.
His father, Will, added, “We heard so many sirens we knew something was wrong.”
Passengers – including Celtics fans – were bused between Riverside and Reservoir Wednesday night. Bus service continued for the morning commute today, between Riverside and Newton Highlands.
Mayor David Cohen was on scene. Governor Deval Patrick expressed his thoughts and prayers to the people involved.

The operator of an MBTA train is dead after her Green Line trolley collided with another train Wednesday night on the Riverside Line in Newton.
Seven passengers were taken to local hospitals, and one was airlifted to a Boston hospital, MBTA officials said.
Crews were unable to free the driver in time to provide medical help to the woman, who had been working for the MBTA for nine months.
Both trains derailed in the crash which occurred about 6 p.m. between the Waban and Woodland stations.
MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo says one train was stopped at a red signal and was ready to roll to the Woodland station when it was hit from behind.
Several ambulances and emergency crews responded, as news helicopters flew overhead and onlookers crept hesitantly through people's backyards, looking for a better view.

GRANITEVILLE, S.C. – A freight train carrying chlorine gas struck a parked train early Thursday, killing eight people and injuring at least 200 others, nearly all of them sickened by a toxic cloud that persisted over this small textile town at nightfall.
Authorities ordered all 5,400 people within a mile of the crash to evacuate in the afternoon because chlorine was continuing to leak and the gas was settling near the ground as temperatures dropped. They were unsure when the gas leak might be sealed.
State Sen. Tommy Moore said Thursday night that officials at Avondale Mill, the textile plant where the crash happened, told him eight people were found dead following the accident, including five inside the mill.
Eight people were in critical condition Thursday night after the 2:30 a.m. wreck of Norfolk Southern trains, in which 16 cars derailed.
Moore said he was told all the deaths were caused by inhaling chlorine fumes, except for the engineer of the moving train, who died in the crash. Sheriff’s Lt. Michael Frank said one person was found dead in a home and another was found in a vehicle.
Most of the injured were treated for respiratory ailments and released, but at least 45 people were admitted to hospitals, authorities said.
Residents were jarred awake Thursday by the sound of metal dragging and a house-shaking boom. A chemical fog lay over the crash site when Douglas Brown drove there after hearing the wreck from his home two streets away.
“You could smell it real good. It made your tongue numb, your throat get sore and your eyes get dry,” said Brown, 44, who was among those treated.
Authorities convinced all but about a dozen people in the area to evacuate, and set up shelters for evacuees. Gov. Mark Sanford declared a state of emergency for Aiken County.
The potentially fatal gas can damage the respiratory and central nervous systems, and the throat, nose and eyes. Those who were exposed were told to report to decontamination units at two schools.
Three of the 42 cars on the moving train were carrying chlorine, Norfolk Southern spokesman Robin Chapman said. He didn’t know how many of the cars were damaged.
No one was aboard the parked train. One person was injured and trapped inside her car for two hours when a tree felled by a train car hit the vehicle, Frank said. Her condition and those of the crew members were unavailable.
Before the evacuation, nearby residents were told to stay inside their homes. Textile plants and schools in the area closed, and a 6 p.m.-to-7 a.m. curfew was imposed on Graniteville, about 15 miles northeast of Augusta, Ga.
Two other hazardous materials, cresol and sodium hydroxide, were being carried on the train in liquid form, but were a less immediate concern because they are corrosive only in direct contact, said Thom Berry, spokesman for the Department of Health and Environmental Control. It was not known Thursday afternoon if either liquid spilled.

On Friday, the Polar Express operated by the California State Railroad Museum from its station in Old Sacramento was involved in a grade-crossing collision, KOVR-TV reports. No injuries occurred, and the vehicle involved drove off. The trip was delayed slightly by an investigation.
Then, on Saturday, the final trip of the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad’s North Pole Adventure holiday excursions was cut short when four cars of the train derailed just north of Peninsula, Ohio. There were no injuries among the 588 passengers and crew members on board, the Akron Beacon Journal reports; while the cars involved all stayed upright, former California Zephyr dome-lounge-observation Silver Solarium “had an obvious tilt,” according to the newspaper. The derailment occurred just before 9 p.m.; buses transported the passengers back to their starting point, with the last arriving by 1 a.m.
A Cuyahoga Valley Scenic representative said the cause is under investigation; a spokeswoman for the National Park Service — which owns the right-of-way within Cuyahoga Valley National Park — said the Federal Railroad Administration will be conduct an investigation.
Finally, NJ.com reports that a Santa Train operated by Conrail was also involved in a grade-crossing accident Saturday night in South Plainfield, N.J., striking a minivan.

A minivan collided with a light rail train in Rancho Cordova on Thursday afternoon, officials said.
The crash happened at Folsom Boulevard and Marketplace Lane around 2:45 p.m.
Sacramento Regional Transit said the minivan's driver appeared to have driven on the wrong side of the road to bypass the cross arms near the Beck's Furniture crossing.
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District said the driver in the crash was taken to the hospital by ambulance and was in stable condition. There was major damage to the minivan.
Sac RT said one passenger on the train was taken to the hospital but their injuries did not appear to be major.
Sac Metro Fire said it could only confirm that the driver was taken to the hospital and was not aware of a light rail passenger being transported.
SacRT said it was operating a bus bridge on the Gold Line between Sunrise and the Iron Point stations.

A walker could be seen on the ground next to the stopped train, where a screen concealed the body of the victim as crime scene investigators took photos.
BNSF officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon.

According to a report from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District. Units were dispatched to the scene at 12:50 p.m. on Wednesday, Mar. 8 at the intersection of Folsom Boulevard and Mather Field Road in Rancho Cordova.
The impact of the collision pushed the Ford F-150 pick up several feet, pinning it between the train car and a trackside utility pole, nearly shearing it in half just behind the cab portion of the vehicle. According to the department posting, the driver of the pick-up was transported to a nearby hospital with unknown injuries. The truck suffered major damage in the collision and the front of the light rail car was damaged as well.
There were no other injuries reported in the collision. The Gold Line travels from Folsom to downtown Sacramento. Transit was affected west of the collision during the incident, requiring transit officials to dispatch bus service, also known as a bus bridge, to service riders between the Rancho Cordova Town Center station and the Butterfield Station further west.
The cause of the collision is currently under investigation.

Three people were killed, and two others were injured when an Amtrak train hit a car near Brentwood Sunday afternoon.
According to Con Fire PIO Steve Hill, at 1:00 P.M. in the 3000 block of Orwood Road located in unincorporated Brentwood, a single passenger vehicle was struck by a west bound train with 85 people aboard. Three people were pronounced dead on scene. Two other victims were air lifted due to major injuries. The scene was turned over to CCC Sheriff’s Office and BNSF.
One of the injured was a child who was transported by helicopter to Children’s Hospital in Oakland.
“A third person was transported due to unrelated medical conditions,” East Contra Contra Fire Protection District PIO Steve Aubert added.
The Contra Costa Coroner’s Office released the identities of the victims. Mercedes Regalado aged 50 of Antioch, Maria Nieves, 27, and Julia Mondragon, 40, both of Dixon died when the Honda Civic they were in was struck as it crossed the railroad tracks.
A report by CBS13 Sacramento included video of the scene showing the damaged car. According to that report, nobody on board the train was hurt.

An unidentified male pedestrian was killed in a train accident in Elk Grove today. The accident happened this morning around 8:45 A.M. north of Elk Grove Boulevard and Railroad Street. The man was struck and killed by a moving Union Pacific train.
According to the Elk Grove Police Department (EGPD), the man was walking on the north side of Elk Grove Boulevard when the train hit him. He died as a result of his injuries. Witnesses said the crossing arms on the tracks were down and the lights were on. The Union Pacific train operator blew the horn, witnesses also say, and the brakes of the train hit. However, it did not stop the train before it hit the man walking across the tracks. His identity is not public at this time. No public statement on the accident from Union Pacific is available.
EGPD closed the Westbound side of Elk Grove Boulevard this morning because of the investigation. The Department’s Traffic Bureau is currently investigating the accident and asks for anyone with information to call the Traffic Bureau at 916-478-8147. Elk Grove Boulevard is now open.

A Union Pacific spokesman says flooded, swamp-like conditions were likely a factor in the partial derailment of a 33-car freight train in suburban Sacramento.
The derailment Friday sent 22 rail cars into the mucky and swollen Cosumnes River. There were three people aboard, but no one was injured.
Railroad spokesman Justin Jacobs told the Sacramento Bee on Saturday that the area around the low-lying tracks was near the overflowing river and flooding may have contributed to the accident. Officials had to halt their investigation late Friday because of rising water. The crash remained under investigation Sunday.
The Union Pacific train carrying food products was headed from Tracy to Roseville on Friday when it derailed at roughly 1 p.m. in the city of Elk Grove.
Hazardous materials crews were called to the scene as a precaution.

When authorities arrived, they found a semi-truck with trailer carrying potatoes that had obviously been hit by the freight train that was stopped at the same crossing. The freight train was able to come to a stop nearby.
Fortunately, no one was hurt in the collision, as the freight train only hit the trailer portion of the semi-truck, not affecting the cab portion.

Around 7 p.m. last Friday, Mickayla Friend and her boyfriend were walking along train tracks while traveling to their high school's Sadie Hawkins dance in Marysville, Calif., a town north of Sacramento. The couple was walking southbound, unaware what was coming up behind them. A train sounded its horn and applied emergency brakes, but it was too late. At the last moment, the boyfriend, whose name has yet to be released, pushed Friend off the tracks and was killed. The 16-year-old Friend is now in critical condition.
The story, which has been picked up by many media outlets since the accident, leaves one big question: how could a massive train creep up on the unsuspecting couple? The scary reality is that it's more common than you might think.
""Statistically, every 94 minutes something or someone is getting hit by a train in the United States,"" says David Rangel, deputy director of Modoc Railroad, a training school for future train engineers. Now, most of those incidents don't involve people—Rangel's statistic also includes the occasional abandoned shopping cart, wayward livestock, and other objects that somehow find their way onto the tracks. But, according to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), 784 people were killed in train-related accidents in 2013, the highest total in the last four years.
That accident rate comes down to a combination of factors, each increasing the likelihood of disasters. ""Railcars are incredibly quiet,"" Rangel says. ""[Tracks] are designed to achieve the lowest possible coefficient of friction...At age 62, I could push a train car down a track."" Unlike a steam engine that would hammer the rails (a main reason why they were retired), modern railcars glide with low friction, and crushed rock underneath the tracks helps diminish impact. ""You won't hear it or feel it,"" Rangel says.
The Doppler Effect, which explains how sound changes pitch based on an observer's location relative to the sound's origin (the reason sirens sound different as they approach you), plays a role. However, since they were in front of the train, where the pitch would be higher, they'd be more likely to hear the siren and doesn't explain why they didn't hear the train coming. Unsurprisingly, some train-collision victims often were wearing headphones or earbuds at the time. (These two were not wearing headphones.)
Terrain can also add to the danger. If a locomotive passes through a corridor lined with trees, those trees act like sound baffles in a recording studio, Rangel says, suppressing the noise. The average railcar traveling at 50 mph measures in decibels between at ""loud voice"" and a ""shout,"" according to the FRA. The horn itself, though, can be even louder than sirens on an ambulance.
Throughout his career, Rangel has two fatalities while operating a train. One of his two sons, who are also engineers, has four. The toll on the men and women operating these trains can be almost as difficult as the grieving families. ""It never leaves,"" Rangel says.
Several hundred tons of metal traveling at fast speeds would seem impossible to go unnoticed, but this false assumption claims lives every year. Your best bet? Just don't go near train tracks.

The mother of a northern California teenager who is in critical condition after being struck by a freight train has paid tribute to the girl's boyfriend who was killed after he pushed her out of the way.
Mickayla Friend, who is currently in Sutter Roseville Medical Center, and Mateus Moore were both involved in the accident on Friday evening near Marysville's only high school. Her mother has admitted that she has not yet told her daughter Mateus has died
Investigators told KCRA-TV that the teens were walking south on the tracks - the same direction as the Union Pacific train. They were scheduled to attend a Sadie Hawkins Day dance.
Young love: This photo of Mateus Moore and Mickayla friend was taken just minutes before the young couple was hit by a train
Mateus and Mickayla (left), were both aged 16. Sandy Friend, the mother of Mickayla (again pictured right), said that Mateus 'sacrificed himself' to save her daughter. He was described as Mickayla's 'first love'.
Sandy Friend, Mickayla's mother, told KTXL-TV in Sacramento that she believes her daughter's boyfriend saved her life.
'She had the love of a young man. He just sacrificed himself to save my daughter,' she said.
'The most heroic thing that any other human being can do on this Earth is save the person that they love.'
Mickayla, who does not yet know that Mateus has died, told her mother while lapsing in and out of consciousness: 'I remember Mateus turning and looking back. And I turned and looked back. I remember him pushing me out of the way of the train.'
Mateus father Marcus added: 'I'm just really proud of him and I know that if presented the opportunity, he would dit again, to save someone's life.'
First love: Family members called Moore Friend's 'first love' who was 'taken away in an instant'
Marysville Police Chief David Baker says investigators are looking into whether the pair got distracted by headphones or something else when the accident occurred.
The conductor sounded the horn and tried to stop, but it typically takes more than a mile to come to a halt, Union Pacific said in statement.
'Our hearts go out to the friends and family of the two individuals involved in the accident,' the statement said. 'It is a stark reminder that railroad tracks are never a safe place to be.'
Mickayla's family previously described Mateus as her 'first love'. Witnesses claimed that Mikayla may have been killed as well had Mateus not pushed her out of the way at the very last second, keeping her from getting pinned underneath the train.
'It's her first boyfriend, and her first love,' Mickayla's sister, Alithya Friend, told KCRA.com. 'And she just got it taken away from her in an instant.'
Sean Stark witnessed the incident and credited Mateus with saving his girlfriend's life.
'The engineer was on the horn,' Mr Stark told KCRA. 'Then finally, they both looked back at the same time.'
Then, Mr Stark said, Mateus made a split-second decision that may have saved his girlfriend's life.
'They would have both been underneath that train if he didn't push her out of the way at the last second,' said Stark.
Horrifying: Emergency personnel work at the scene of a train accident where two pedestrians where one teen was killed and nother critically injured after being hit by a train
The accident happened around 7.00 p.m., and in front of dozens of horrified onlookers scrambling to shield their children at a local baseball game from the traumatizing scene, according to the Appeal-Democrat.
Parents attending the game raced towards the tracks fearing one of their own had been hit, Marysville Little League Secretary Diane Washburn told the paper.

Every parent's worst nightmare: Police on the scene of the terible accident
'It wasn't one of our kids, just get back,' she recalled telling the swelling crowd, adding that her next priority was keeping children from seeing what had happened. 'Once they see that, that can't be unseen.'
People who were at the game told the Marysville Appeal-Democrat they heard a long blowing of the train's horn, much longer than usual.
'He honked from so far back there,' a concession stand volunteer told the paper.
Another said the engineer honked 'a bunch and a bunch and a bunch.'
The small town of about 12,000 was rocked by the incident.
'Marysville is a small but busy city,' said a fire department spokesman. 'Everybody knows everybody so it was pretty traumatic.'

HELENDALE, Calif. (VVNG.com) — One person is dead and another was airlifted after a BNSF train hit a Ford Mustang early Tuesday in the community of Helendale.
It happened at about 3:27 am, on April 18, 2023, in the area of Jordan Road and Vista Road.
According to the California Highway Patrol incident logs, a black Ford Mustang was on the side of the tracks with a male and a dog trapped inside the vehicle.
Per the logs, the engineer advised the driver was awake and breathing but he was unable to take him out due to the dog inside the vehicle.
Emergency personnel arrived and pronounced the passenger deceased at the scene. A Mercy Air helicopter landed nearby and airlifted the driver of the vehicle to Antelope Valley Hospital. Officials said he is expected to survive.
Apple Valley Animal Control arrived and took possession of the dog.
This is the 2nd fatal vehicle vs train collision to occur within a week in the same general area.
By 7:50 am, the coroner had removed the body from the vehicle and a tow truck was preparing to remove the vehicle from the tracks. BNSF employees will inspect the area and once complete the railroad crossing will reopen to the public.
The Victorville California Highway Patrol is assisting with the investigation.

Driver In Train Crash That Killed 2 Panicked, Pulled Onto Tracks: Redlands Official
""It appears that when the gate came down on her car, she panicked and pulled forward and ended up in the path of the train.""
REDLANDS, CA — A woman who died last week after a train fatally struck the mother and her 11-year-old daughter had pulled her car onto the tracks after a gate lowered over her vehicle, according to a city official.
Heather Lynn Woolard, 47, of Redlands, was hit by a Metrolink train just before 8:30 p.m. April 4 at Alabama Street, authorities said. The vehicle was facing north and the train was headed west, according to police.
Woolard had pulled her vehicle over the limit line at a red light and was in the path of a gate that lowered onto her car, Public Information Officer Carl Baker said.

“Had she just stayed where she was, the investigator believes the train would not have struck the car,” he said. “It appears that when the gate came down on her car, she panicked and pulled forward and ended up in the path of the train.”
The train was traveling about 50 mph when the engineer saw the vehicle on the tracks and attempted to stop, according to police, who said the 11-year-old passenger was ejected from the car and pronounced dead at the scene. Woolard died about a day later of her injuries, according to the San Bernardino County coroner.

A GoFundMe in memory of the mother and daughter has received just over $15,000 in donations toward a $100,000 goal as of Tuesday afternoon.
Four seconds passed between the time the gates had fully lowered and when a westbound train reached the crossing, The Press-Enterprise reported after visiting the crash site.
All the safety gates and signals at the intersection were working properly and there was no indication Woolard was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, police said.
The city of Riverside is a quiet zone for trains, which means engineers don’t routinely blow their horns when passing through, but they still have clearance to do so if they believe it’s necessary, according to Baker.
Just two days after the April 6 crash, a pedestrian was struck Thursday afternoon near Mountain View Avenue after he intentionally stepped onto the tracks, police said.

However, as devastating as this accident is to the area, its environment and its wildlife, damage from some earlier derailments has been immeasurably worse. While technology and regulations have dramatically improved safety and saved lives, there is still a long way to go.
Here are some of the most impactful freight train derailments in world history.
Lac-Mégantic, Quebec
One of the deadliest freight train derailments happened relatively recently. July 6, 2013, Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, was nearly destroyed after a runaway train loaded with 203,000 gallons of petroleum crude oil crashed into the center of the small town. According to a 2018 article from BBC looking back on the accident, 47 people died in what investigators originally believed was an avoidable accident. Three Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway company employees — the engineer, operations manager and the man in charge of rail circulation — were charged with criminal negligence but were acquitted after a three-month trial.
The town is still recovering from the disaster.
The train was parked with the locomotive still running to keep its air-braking system on, according to The Canadian Encyclopedia. However, not enough hand brakes were applied as it sat on a downward slope. Overnight, the parked train’s engine caught fire. Firefighters arrived and turned off the engine, resulting in part of the braking system also shutting down.
At 1 a.m., shortly after the firefighters left the scene with the fire extinguished, the train began rolling. Eventually it jumped the tracks at 65 mph, destroying 40 buildings and causing oil to seep into the soil and nearby river.
New standards in rail safety were put in place following the tragedy in an effort to prevent a recurrence.
Viareggio, Italy
In the summer of 2009, an axle of the first car on a freight train cargoed with liquefied petroleum gas broke, causing the train to derail and explode, according to The New York Times. The ensuing fires collapsed five buildings, killed 32 people and left 100 homeless.
Citizens criticized the Italian prime minister for allowing the shipment of hazardous materials through a residential town.
“We saw a ball of fire rising up to the sky,” witness Gianfranco Bini told The Associated Press. “We heard three big rumbles, like bombs. It looked like war had broken out.”
San Bernardino, California
A major Southern Pacific Railroad accident in San Bernardino, California, just outside Los Angeles, killed numerous people and left lasting emotional and physical damage in the community. The Los Angeles Times reported that the train was 3,000 tons heavier than was estimated, revealed in a National Transportation Safety Board investigation. It was traveling at 90 mph with one of its brake sets disconnected.
The conductor was unable to slow the train as it went around the bend on a slight incline and it derailed. Two rail employees were killed in the initial crash. But almost two weeks later when residents started to return home, a 14-inch underground gas pipeline caught fire due to damage during the derailment cleanup.
Ninety percent of Las Vegas’ gasoline was reported to travel through the pipeline. Three hundred thousand gallons of fuel erupted in the air, catching on fire, killing more people and destroying even more homes. There are conflicting reports on how many deaths in total are related to the train derailment.
Weyauwega, Wisconsin
A Wisconsin Central freight train derailed on March 4, 1996, at 5:45 a.m. It was filled with petroleum liquid gas, like the incident in Italy, but also carried two tank cars filled with sodium hydroxide. A massive fire broke out after the crash, forcing firefighters to abandon any attempt at containing the blaze after 45 minutes and instead focus on evacuating residents, according to a local news report from Spectrum News 7.
The continuing fire meant the potential for a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion, or BLEVE. The condition occurs when pressurized liquid inside a vessel reaches temperatures higher than its boiling point. It was likely the train cars would not be able to contain the pressure and would explode. Thankfully, that is not what happened.
Officials immediately shut down the natural gas line running to the town because it was located directly underneath the crash. The fire was not fully extinguished until March 8. Locals were unable to return to the area for more than two weeks. No one was killed in the fire, but the damage was extensive.
As more regulation and innovation come to rail, there may be fewer such disasters in the future.

According to authorities, the collision occurred on Rancho Avenue.
Reports indicated that the truck driver approached the tracks at an unsafe speed when it failed to stop for the guard crossing arm and collided with the Metrolink train traveling eastbound.
There were more than 30 passengers aboard the train at the time of the crash.
Due to the impact, the truck was left in a mangled state, with debris strewn across the railroad.
The truck driver and the passenger were taken to a local hospital and are still in critical condition.
Meanwhile, only one Metrolink passenger sustained minor injuries in the crash.
Train Collision Statistics
According to the National Transportation Safety Board, trains collide with people or vehicles every two hours. Train accidents kill thousands of people every year. A total of 600 people were killed, and 2,300 were injured.
According to the National Transportation Safety Board, a train collision is more likely to kill pedestrians than an auto collision. More than half of all train accidents are caused by insufficient or outdated safety features, dangerous crossings, and inadequate motorist warning systems.
More than 7,200 people have died in train accidents in the United States since 1997. Train collisions with pedestrians are the leading cause of death on American railroads, outnumbering all other reasons.
The train is the most efficient mode of transportation. An employee or passenger’s safety is affected by several factors, including the conductor’s skill and maintenance frequency. They are dangerous because they take unsafe shortcuts or are irresponsible.
Accidents involving trains result from derailments, worn tracks, poor security, and disregard for safety rules.
What Should I Do Following an Accident
Once you have gathered information, you should file a police report if it is safe. It allows the police to keep records in one place and information about what happened during the accident in an up-to-date, secure database within the department.
A police officer will usually be present at the scene of an accident. However, if they are not present, you can contact your local police to file an accident report after the fact, either by phone or in person. In this way, if the police are not present at the scene of the collision, they can gather the information and prepare a report afterward.

According to CAL FIRE Fire Department, crews were called just before noon on October 13, 2022 and found one of the four train’s locomotives on fire.
The engineer stopped the train so the burning engine was close to Summit Valley Road so it was easily accessible for fire apparatus. No train cars were endangered. The fire was extinguished within 15-30 minutes. Units were on the scene for nearly an hour to make sure no flare ups.
Summit Valley Road had one lane blocked near Trout Rd. during the fire fight.
No one was injured and the damage caused by the fire was contained to the engine bay.

The regional prosecutor said the victims appeared to be Algerian migrants who had been expelled from nearby Spain and had been sleeping on the tracks, calling it a “terrible human drama.”
The train was on a line that links the seaside resort town of Hendaye, on France’s border with Spain, and the city of Bordeaux, the national railway company SNCF said. The collision occurred at around 5:30 a.m., striking four people who were on the tracks, it said.
Only one victim has been definitively identified: a 21-year-old man who had recently received an expulsion order from Spanish authorities, according to Bayonne Prosecutor Jérôme Bourrier. Two others had documents suggesting they were in the same situation, but authorities are still working to verify their identities, Bourrier told a news conference.
He said it appeared that the group had been sleeping on the tracks, and were hit by the first train of the morning. While he said migrants walk on the tracks in the area, given its proximity to the border, “what’s more surprising here is that the people were lying down, even resting.”
The injured person’s life is not in danger, the prosecutor said.

Per scanner reports, the man-lift operator in his 40’s, sustained major head trauma and was airlifted to Antelope Valley Hospital. Officials have not released any update on his condition.

Person struck, killed on Metrolink San Bernardino County Line tracks near Upland station
A Metrolink train struck and killed a man in the city of Rancho Cucamonga Monday morning, Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said. The train struck a man who was walking on the tracks, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
Service was interrupted for a few hours on Metrolink's westbound San Bernardino County Line as authorities investigated the death.
At about 4:30 a.m., Metrolink train 301 killed someone between Baker and Grove avenues in Rancho Cucamonga. The train started in San Bernardino and was on its way to Los Angeles. The incident occurred between the Rancho Cucamonga and Upland stations, as the train traveled westbound just before it reached Upland station.
There were 194 passengers on the train, and Metrolink offered them bus service to L.A.'s Union Station.
The train was supposed to arrive at 5:30 a.m. At 7:30 a.m, train 301 was released from scene of the accident and began making its way towards downtown Los Angeles, but service on the westbound train route remained interrupted for another hour.
By 8:30 a.m., the tracks reopened, and Metrolink spokesman Johnson said service would return to normal. He expected the 9:02 a.m. train leaving L.A. Union Station for San Bernardino and the 9:40 a.m. train leaving San Bernardino for Los Angeles to depart on time.
The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident. The name of the man is not being released pending further investigation and the notification of his family.
This story has been updated.

What to Do After a Train Accident in Chula Vista, CA
A train accident can be overwhelming, and knowing the right steps to take afterward is crucial for protecting your health and legal rights. Taking immediate action can greatly impact the outcome of your case.
Here are the steps you need to take to ensure that you receive the treatment and compensation you are entitled to.
- Seek Medical Attention. Even if you feel fine, it’s essential to seek medical care as soon as possible. Injuries from train accidents, such as whiplash, broken bones, or internal injuries, may not be immediately apparent. Prompt treatment also helps document your injuries, which is vital for your case.
- Call Emergency Services. Dial 911 and report the accident. Emergency responders will assess the scene, provide medical assistance, and file an official report, which can be crucial for your claim.
- Document the Scene. If you are able to do so safely, take photos of the accident scene, including the train, any damage, and visible injuries. Record the time, location, and any other important details about the incident. This documentation can serve as vital evidence.
- Gather Information. Collect names, contact information, and insurance details from any other parties involved in the accident, including train conductors, passengers, and witnesses. If possible, get the contact information of the police officers who respond to the scene.
- Do Not Admit Fault. Even if you think you might be responsible, avoid admitting fault at the scene. It’s important to allow investigators to determine the cause of the accident.
- Contact An Experienced Train Accident Lawyer. Consult with an attorney as soon as possible. A knowledgeable lawyer will help protect your legal rights, investigate the cause of the accident, and guide you through the process of filing a claim. Having legal representation can significantly improve your chances of securing the compensation you deserve.
- Avoid Speaking to Insurance Companies. After the accident, insurance companies may contact you for a statement. It’s best not to speak with them until you’ve consulted with a lawyer. Insurance adjusters may try to get you to settle quickly, often for much less than your claim is worth.

A collision between a trolley car and a truck injured 17 people in the midst of rush hour Tuesday evening, causing damage that required track repairs.
Despite the damage, the southbound Blue Line began limited service Wednesday.
“Trolleys are now operating through the impacted area between H St and Palm,” MTS tweeted from its X account.
But service frequency was initially limited to every 15 minutes rather than the normal 7.5 minutes, authorities said. A bus shuttle took passengers to all impacted stations as the early-morning commute began, but by about 5:45 a.m. the limited service had started.
Riders, authorities said, should “still expect some delays as the system recovers.”

According to police, a group of people became impatient after a train was sitting on the tracks and blocking access to 5th Avenue across the street from the Convention Center and decided to climb over and under the train.
“The trolley arms were down, it was a slow moving train and people… didn’t want to wait for the train,” San Diego police Lt. Anthony Reese told Onscene.Media.
The engineer had no idea that the BNS&F train had struck anybody and thus did not stop, he said. First responders found one person on the tracks.
“One female tried to cross and either got slipped and fell or got stuck underneath the train, and her right leg got run over,” Reese said, adding that her leg may have to be amputated.

SPECIFICALLY, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR MAP, WE ARE ALL IN THE GREEN. WE DO HAVE SOMETHING IN ORANGE VALE THAT MELANIE WINGO WILL DETAIL IN A MOMENT, BUT NOT AFFECTING ANY TRAFFIC. SO THAT’S GREAT. DOWN ON I-5 SOUTHBOUND, SOUTH OF STOCKTON, EVEN THERE, THERE WAS A WRECK EARLIER. THERE ARE PIECES OF THOSE CARS IN THE ROADWAY AND THEY ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM THAT WRECK. MINOR INJURY, WRECK. ALSO SOMETHING HAPPENING IN COPPEROPOLIS JUST POPPED UP ON THE MAP. I KNOW IT’S REMOTE, BUT A CAR DROVE THROUGH 250FT OF FENCE LINE AND ALL OF THAT’S IN THE ROADWAY. IF YOU’RE COPPEROPOLIS VIEWER THAT IS HAPPENING, PLEASE BE AWARE. OTHER THAN THAT, TRACY TRIANGLE IS REALLY OUR ONLY PAIN POINT THIS MORNING IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC.

YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE STORY HE DID ON ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY INSIDE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. IT IS PRETTY AWESOME. IT’S KIND OF A GAME CHANGER, SO IT’S NEAT. YEAH. WE’LL JOIN BRIAN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES. THE MEANTIME, RIGHT NOW, PART OF A MAJOR STREET IN ORANGEVILLE HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF BECAUSE OF A VEHICLE THAT CRASHED INTO A UTILITY POLE. THIS WAS ON GREENBACK LANE NEAR HAZEL AVENUE. CREWS GOT THE CALL THERE AROUND 2 A.M. OUR MELANIE WINGO JOINS US LIVE WITH THE WORK THAT’S UNDERWAY. AND IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE THEY HAVE OPENED IT. MELANIE OKAY, SO JUST WITHIN THE LAST TWO MINUTES SINCE WE SAW YOU RIGHT AT THE TOP OF OUR 6 A.M. NEWSCAST, THEY HAVE MOVED IN. THE BIG GUNS, THE BIG TRUCKS FOR SMUD, AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN A NEW POWER POLE THAT WE EXPECT WILL BE REPLACING THIS ONE THAT IS NOW LEANING OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SO WE SEE BIGGER SMUD VEHICLES EVEN THAN WE SAW IN OUR LAST HALF HOUR. NOW IN PLACE STAGING READY TO BEGIN WORK ON THIS POWER POLE THAT WAS HIT BY A CAR OVERNIGHT. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF PHOTOGRAPHS THAT A VIEWER SENT US A SHORT TIME AGO, THAT THIS IS HOW THINGS LOOKED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT CAR CRASHED INTO THE POWER POLE, RIGHT NOW, IT’S NOT KNOWN WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH OR HOW THE DRIVER IS DOING. ACCORDING TO CHP, THAT’S ALL UNDER INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW, BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED, THE CAR WAS JUST BEING TOWED AWAY AND CHP OFFICERS AT THE SCENE SAID THIS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE MORNING COMMUTE OUT HERE AT GREENBACK LANE, RIGHT AT BRAZIL, WHERE WE’RE JUST WEST OF HAZEL AVENUE, RIGHT IN THE ORANGEVILLE AREA. IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PART OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY, RESTORING POWER TO THE 25 CUSTOMERS AFFECTED IS THE GOAL. ALSO MAKING SURE THIS KEY PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS SAFE BECAUSE AS WE’RE LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE STABLE WHATSOEVER. SO THEY’VE GOT THE LINES DE-ENERGIZED THE CREWS OUT HERE AND JUST JUST AGAIN WITHIN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES OR SO, THEY HAVE REALLY PUT THESE BIGGER VEHICLES INTO POSITION AND IT APPEARS THEY’RE MAKING SOME PRETTY QUICK WORK OF GETTING RIGHT TO IT. THOSE CREWS WERE OUT HERE ASSESSING FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND NOW THEY ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THEY GOT ALL THE MACHINERY OUT AND READY TO GO, AND WE’RE GOING TO SEE THEIR PROGRESS OUT HERE AS THEY MAKE IT TO TRY TO GET THIS POLE PUT UP. SO WE’LL REPORT BACK IN JUST A BIT WITH THEIR PROGRESS. ALL RIGHT. BACK TO YOU IN THE STUDIO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IN THE MEANTIME, AN ACCUSED SERIAL KILLER DUE TO BE BACK IN COURT THIS MORNING IN STOCKTON. HERE’S SOME VIDEO NOW OF WESLEY BROWNLEE FROM A COURT APPEARANCE EARLIER THIS YEAR. HE’S ACCUSED OF KILLING SEVEN PEOPLE OVER 18 MONTHS. FIVE OF THEM HAPPEN IN STOCKTON. TWO OCCURRED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. BROWNLEE IS ALSO ACCUSED OF THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF AN EIGHTH PERSON WHO WAS SHOT, BUT SURVIVED. TODAY’S HEARING IS A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY. SO THAT MEANS EITHER HIS DEFENSE TEAM WILL ASK PROSECUTORS TO TURN OVER EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, OR PROSECUTORS WILL ASK THE DEFENSE FOR INFORMATION IN THEIR CASE. A 606 NOW. NOW TO MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE A HELICOPTER ACCIDENT KILLED IRAN’S PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER. MIKE CHERRY IS JOINING US NOW WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AND ALSO WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. YEAH. SO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO. IT JUST SHOWS THE HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS THAT FIRST RESPONDERS WERE DEALING WITH WHEN THEY TRIED TO HEAD TO THAT CRASH SITE. OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT RESTRICTED VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE POOR WEATHER IS WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH. IRAN’S PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER WERE RETURNING FROM A COMMEMORATION EVENT WHEN THE CRASH TOOK PLACE, KILLING EIGHT PEOPLE IN ALL. THIS COMES DURING A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. IRAN ARMS RUSSIA IN ITS WAR AGAINST UKRAINE, AND THEN IT ALSO ATTACKED ISRAEL AMID ITS ONGOING WAR AGAINST HAMAS. NOW THE PRESIDENT POSITION IN IRAN IS SEEN AS A SECOND IN COMMAND BEHIND THE SUPREME LEADER. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS THE TOP ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THAT COUNTRY. STILL, OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL IN THE COUNTRY. EARLIER THIS MORNING, IRAN’S CABINET ANNOUNCED THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT IS TAKING OVER THE POSITION UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAPPENS WITHIN THE NEXT 50 DAYS. TAHOE. ALL RIGHT, MIKE, THANK YOU. WELL, THIS MORNING, A MAN IS IN JAIL ACCUSED OF MOLESTING A FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL THAT VICTIM IS NOW A TEENAGER AND REPORTED IT TO HER FAMILY. NOW, THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE MORE VICTIMS. KCRA 3’S LETICIA ORDAZ LIVE NOW IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WITH MORE ON WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS YOUR HELP. DURANTE OH GOOD MORNING. THIS IS A VERY DISTURBING CASE IN OUR REGION. THAT MAN IS NOW AT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY JAIL WHERE HE CAN’T HURT ANYONE. BUT ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, HE WAS A KARATE INSTRUCTOR IN TOWN. HE WAS ALSO A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER, SO HE HAD ACCESS TO A LOT OF KIDS. THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE COULD BE MORE VICTIMS WHO SIMPLY HAVEN’T COME FORWARD YET. SO THIS IS HOW THIS STORY UNFOLDED. ON FRIDAY, A WOMAN CALLED THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE TO REPORT HER TEENAGE DAUGHTER WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED WHEN SHE WAS JUST FOUR YEARS OLD BY A FAMILY FRIEND. DETECTIVES ENDED UP ARRESTING THE SUSPECT, 49 YEAR OLD JASON PRATER, AFTER THEY SAY HE MADE SOME ADMISSIONS AND CONFIRMED SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF THE GIRL’S STATEMENT. DEPUTIES SAY BEFORE HIS ARREST ON FRIDAY, PRATER WORKED AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER AT JOHN ADAMS ACADEMY IN ROSEVILLE, AND DEPUTIES TELL US PRATER PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT OPTIONS FOR YOUTH CHARTER SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO UNTIL LAST AUGUST. PRATER WAS ALSO A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR IN THE SACRAMENTO AND ROSEVILLE AREAS, AND INVESTIGATORS WANT FAMILIES TO COME FORWARD IF THEY SUSPECT THEIR CHILD COULD BE A VICTIM, COME FORWARD, BRING THIS INFORMATION TO US. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AGAIN, ANYTHING THAT HE’S BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR, HE’S HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR. AND AGAIN, I DON’T CARE IF IT HAPPENED 20 YEARS AGO, 30 YEARS AGO. DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT. PLEASE BRING THAT INFORMATION. ANY LITTLE TIDBIT CAN HELP US AGAIN. KEEP HIM LOCKED AWAY. OUR BIGGEST THING RIGHT NOW, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN’T VICTIMIZE ANYONE ELSE. AND PRATER WILL FACE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SACRAMENTO. HE FACES TWO COUNTS OF CHILD MOLESTATION, AND RIGHT NOW, HIS BAIL HAS BEEN SET. AT $2.1 MILLION. REPORTING LIVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY, LETICIA ORDAZ KCRA THREE NEWS. ALL RIGHT, LETICIA, THANK YOU. 609 NOW, WE DID REACH OUT TO JOHN ADAMS ACADEMY IN ROSEVILLE TO COMMENT ON THE ARREST OF THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. AT THIS POINT, NO WORD BACK. WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED. HOWEVER, WE GOT A LIVE SKYCAM VIEW HERE OVER THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER IN SACRAMENTO STATE WRAPPING UP THREE DAYS OF GRADUATION CEREMONIES OVER THE WEEKEND.

On April 26, 2024, a train carrying 3 locomotives & 97 cars heading towards Phoenix, Arizona would derail in Gallup, New Mexico. The derailment was so bad it caused Interstate 40 to be closed both ways for DAYS.
Amazingly the train crash at the New Mexico/Arizona was captured on video right when it happened
Usually when this sort of event happens, you see video of the aftermath & the clean up of the wreckage. But not this time; a car's dashboard camera managed to capture video right when the train left the tracks AND the insuring explosion that followed. You can even see just HOW CLOSE that first fireball got to the camera car, and I-40 itself.
The person who uploaded this footage, Harry Collins Photography, stated that this was his mother & father in law who caught this amazing derailment on camera.
That wasn't the only video of the train derailment either; there was another one from a truck driver that captured the massive explosive after the train crashed. It wasn't as close as the first one but after seeing how big that fireball is... thank god they WEREN'T closer to the flames!
Thankfully no one was killed. In fact, no one was INJURED in the crash, which is amazing considering the size of the fireballs that came from the crash itself.
This wasn't the first time a train would derail in either New Mexico or Arizona; but thankfully this is NOT a case that resulted in a loss of life.

The man was hospitalized with major injuries after he was struck at 9 p.m. Monday by a northbound train near the intersection of Via De La Valle and Camino Del Mar in Del Mar, according to San Diego Sheriff’s Sgt. Jason King.
Earlier the same day, a woman was fatally struck by a northbound Coaster about 3:30 p.m. near the intersection of Morena Boulevard and Asher Street in San Diego, King said.
“When San Diego police officers arrived, they found a woman who was hit by a northbound Coaster train,” King said. “Paramedics rushed to give aid, but she did not survive her injuries.”
The Medical Examiner’s Office will identify the woman and notify relatives of her death.
Earlier in the holiday weekend, at 3:25 p.m. Sunday, a man was struck and killed by northbound Coaster train near the intersection of Pacific Highway and West Washington Street.

Witnesses at the overground station said the train crashed through barriers, with people fleeing the platform in terror.
Images from the scene show the train crushed against the station wall, with London Fire Brigade at the scene.
They tweeted: ""Firefighters have attended a derailed train at #Enfield Town station this morning. Crews carried out a systematic search of the train to ensure no one was trapped. Two people have been treated for minor injuries by @Ldn_Ambulance crews.""

A worker from a nearby sorting office said he was ""shocked"" by the sight of the crashed train at Enfield station but added the situation ""seemed very much in control"".
Gary Spencer said he did not hear the crash but walked over to the station from his workplace after seeing dozens of emergency services vehicles rushing to the scene.
""(There was) initially some shock but more importantly (I was hoping) that there were no casualties,"" the 37-year-old told the PA news agency.
""I have never known a train to fail stopping at the end of the line... if the metal steel was not behind the buffer I'm confident the train would have damaged the building.
""The situation seemed very much in control.""
Around 50 people were evacuated following the morning crash.
Station staff helped passengers off the train before London Fire Brigade attended, with station commander Jim O'Neill saying: ""The train had hit the buffers at the station, which is at the end of the line, and gone up over the top of them.
""Firefighters carried out a systematic search of the train to ensure there were no further people on board.
""Crews assisted station staff to make the scene safe and a recovery operation will now be carried out.""
Three fire engines and two fire rescue units rushed to the scene at around 8.30am and left after checking the train about an hour later, a spokesman said.
The train left Liverpool Street at around 7.45am and hit the barriers at around 8.15am.
As a result of the crash, Overground services have been suspended between Enfield Town and Edmonton Green, Network Rail said.
A resident who lives in a flat overlooking the station said his family was ""scared"" when they were awoken by the loud bang of the crash and looked out the window to see the derailed train.
Another man who worked nearby described hearing the huge ""volume of fire engines and ambulances at the scene"" and went to see what happened.
One commuter also told of the ""chaos"" when he arrived at Enfield Town and was forced to try and catch a train from another station.
Kyel Matin added: ""Fortunately it didn't go through the station window.""
The London Ambulance Service said a hazardous materials team was dispatched and the two injured people were not taken to hospital.
A spokesman said: ""We were called this morning to reports of a train derailed at Enfield Town railway station.
""We sent a number of resources to the scene, including from London Ambulance Service Hazardous Area Response Team and The London Ambulance Service Emergency Planning and Resilience Officers tactical advisors.
""Two people were assessed at the scene for minor injuries, but they were not taken to hospital.""
Network Rail said the service is not expected to resume as it should until 3pm this afternoon.
A spokesman said: ""An operating incident at Enfield Town means no trains will run between Edmonton Green and Enfield Town.

They would pick up the train fast and be at track speed very quickly. Leaving Anaheim, it is 2 miles to a sweeping curve boarded for 65 mph. At the east end of the curve was the State College Boulevard road crossing, which was protected by automatic signal flashers and signs indicating a railroad crossing.
As I approached the crossing at the prescribed 65 mph, I could see the red flashers working. I was sounding the air horn long and loud. We were almost at the crossing when suddenly two large dump trucks, running bumper to bumper, reached the crossing. The leading truck somehow made it across, but the second truck did not. We struck it dead center, with a loud crash. One moment I was looking at the track ahead, then the next all I could see was blue sky.
The engine rose up, twisted, and turned on her right side. We were violently slammed along the ballast with sand, rocks, and pieces of debris coming in the cab window on my side. Ed Seybels, my fireman, was thrown from the left-side seat down on top of me, then back against the rear of the cab. We traveled about the equivalent of a city block amid sounds of tearing metal, with dust and glass flying inside the cab. I could see we were heading for a building, and I thought we were going to crash into it. Suddenly all the noise stopped, and the engine came to rest just short of the building. I couldn’t believe how quiet it was.
Ed was behind me in the sand and debris that filled the bottom of the cab. “Eddy, we better get out of here, she might catch on fire!” I said.
The left-side cab window was the only way out, and I climbed up on the control stand and was able to reach the handle to open the window. I managed to get it open and told Eddy to get up on the control stand. He was dazed but managed to make it. We both got out of the window and were standing on the left side of the engine when the conductor came running up to see if we were OK. We were about 10 feet off the ground and he told us to stay put until the fire department arrived with a ladder. Both Eddy and I were covered with blood from many cuts and abrasions.
There was a 2-gallon glass drinking-water jug mounted in the center of the cab. When it shattered in the collision, flying glass from it had cut us up considerably, including a large cut on the side of my neck. In the emergency room at the Anaheim hospital, a doctor told me that the cut was a sixteenth of an inch from severing my jugular vein. Both Eddy and I had bruises all over our bodies. We were taken to the Santa Fe hospital in Los Angeles and released on December 24 so we could be home for Christmas.
The two locomotives, Nos. 61 and 51C, never worked again. They sat on a track at the San Bernardino shops for a long time and were finally scrapped. I shall always consider myself very fortunate in that we were on an Alco PA on this trip instead of the EMD F units that were more commonly used on the San Diegans. The Alco’s long nose, constructed of heavy-gauge steel and reinforced with heavy steel bracing, took the brunt of the impact and, I believe, saved our lives.
There were injuries among passengers on the train, but no fatalities. The first coach behind the engines was telescoped and crushed through the vestibule and restroom area, and came to rest in a parking lot adjacent to the right of way. The second car sat a short distance away, turned over and almost completely on its side. This was the car in which most of the passenger injuries occurred. The next four cars were derailed but remained upright, and the last two were not derailed.
The driver of the truck we hit was instantly killed. Both trucks were loaded with 17 tons of sand for a building site in the area. It was learned later that the drivers had stopped at a cafe and had stayed too long, thus they were late for the delivery deadline of the sand.
Wrecking crews managed to clear the accident area and place a shoo-fly in service about 10:30 p.m., some 10 hours after the wreck. About a week or so later, it was reported that crossing gates would be installed at the State College Boulevard crossing.
While many years have passed since this incident, I well remember the wild ride Ed Seybels and I, and our passengers, experienced that day in 1965 on train 76.

There are so many other reminders.
He was in Little Italy that night, two summers ago, singing in a bar with a cover band called Backstage Pass. He wandered away between sets and wound up standing on the tracks at the Hawthorn Street crossing. Witnesses said he was talking on his cellphone, unaware of what was headed his way.
A 540-ton Amtrak Surfliner.
Train operators saw Clark, blew the horn and hit the brakes, but there wasn’t enough time to avoid impact at about 30 miles per hour.
Clark spent weeks in a coma and almost a year in various hospitals. A brain injury slowed his speech, his motor skills, his memory. Numerous bones were broken. His legs, arms, feet, shoulders, hands — almost nothing works the way it used to.
One thing left unchanged, according to people who know him: An optimistic streak bordering on stubbornness.
“I got hit by a train and I lived,” he said. “I’m not bragging. I’m just fortunate beyond belief.”
Now the 57-year-old Clairemont resident spends his days trying to move beyond just being alive. He wants his life back, too.
For almost three decades he was a retailing free spirit, running the used-goods stores Music Trader and Thrift Trader as much by feel as by spreadsheet, reveling on the front end in the bargains he found at estate sales and swap meets, and then on the back end when customers discovered those same treasures on his shelves.
“I loved everything about the stores,” he said, which were shut down, the merchandise put in storage, when it looked as if he might die from the accident. “Still do.”
He’d like to sing again, too, and not just in the steam room at the 24 Hour Fitness where he works out almost every day. The hot, moist air soothes his vocal folds, and if no one else is listening — and sometimes even if they are — he’ll sit in there and do voice exercises.
His singing on four CDs and in live gigs around town reminded some of Counting Crows’ Adam Duritz or Live’s Ed Kowalczyk. “Such a great rock voice,” said Mick Kling, a guitarist who performed with Clark in Backstage Pass.
But while getting his life back is the goal, Clark is also a realist. He knows he’s someone now who goes to McDonald’s for takeout one night, puts the food in his minivan and then forgets about it until he sees the bag the next morning.
He’s someone whose shuffle from the locker room at the gym to the front door takes almost 10 minutes. “I’ll be there by Christmas,” he joked while making the trek one day last week.
And he’s someone who wears a yellow rubber bracelet, given to him by a friend, with words etched into it that serve as his motto: “It’s a work in progress.”
Passion for music
He was probably drinking.
Clark liked to down beers when he was performing, and on June 24, 2017, he and his band mates at the Loading Dock in Little Italy were also celebrating a birthday. Kling, the guitarist, turned 50.
“So I might have had more than I usually do,” Clark said.
But something else was going on that day, based on text messages he sent to friends. He wasn’t feeling well, seemed off in some way. Kling remembers him as “particularly loose and loopy.”
Clark has a history of cardiac issues, including a stroke, and he wonders now if he had a second one that day. Scans after the accident suggested that might be the case, he said. Or maybe there was an issue with his heart medication.
Whatever it was, it wasn’t enough to keep him from the stage that night. Not much could back then.
Rock music has been a passion of his since he was 7. Growing up in Battle Creek, MI., he saved his nickels and dimes until he had enough to go to a record store and buy two Elvis Presley records.
When he was 19, he moved to California. “I’d seen all the TV shows with the girls in bikinis,” he said. He tried San Francisco first and didn’t like it, and then someone suggested San Diego.
“Everything here made sense to me, the way each community has its own feel,” he said. “I’d never lived any place before where I felt like I did here, like I belonged.”
He worked different jobs — movie theaters, bookstores — and then one day on the radio heard Monte Kobey talking about a new swap meet in the old Walker Scott department store downtown. Clark took some of his own CDs, bought others, and began selling them there.
“I didn’t make a lot of money, but I learned a lot,” he said.
He also met a woman there who would become his wife, Debbi. “He had a magnetic personality, always drawing other people to him,” she said. “He was the life of the party.”
Together they opened Music Trader in the late 1980s. From one store on El Cajon Boulevard, they grew the used-CD business into a chain that had 16 outlets throughout the county when they sold the business in 1999 for $4 million.
Clark used some of the money to bankroll a recording of his own, “Addicted,” by a band he called Ten Sugar Coffee. Backed by experienced musicians, including ones from Kings Road and Little River Band, he sang polished versions of songs by John Gorka, Patty Griffin, Dave Alvin and others.
Dismissed initially by some as a vanity project, the CD garnered radio play on stations here and elsewhere, and it led to opening-act performances at concerts by B.B. King and Sonia Dada. Three other CDs followed.
Clark also began sitting in with various cover bands around town, which is how he wound up in Little Italy with Backstage Pass that June night two years ago, wandering off between sets at about 11:30 p.m. with his cellphone in his hand.
Life or death
About 1,000 people were hit by trains in the United States in 2017, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. Some 20 percent of them — 214 — were in California. Of those, 123 were fatalities.
It’s enough of a problem that it has its own non-profit public-awareness organization, Operation Lifesaver, which has helped trim the number of annual casualties over the past 30 years. Still, people wind up on the tracks for a variety of reasons. Some are suicidal. Some, in coastal areas, are crossing to get to the beach.
And some, like Clark, are distracted.
When he didn’t make it home, friends started calling friends and one of them eventually tried Clark’s cellphone. A stranger answered and said something to the effect of, “This is the phone of the guy who got hit by the train last night.”
Word made it to his ex-wife, Debbi, and she got on her computer — “Thank goodness for the Internet,” she said — and read media accounts of the accident that pointed her to the hospital where Clark had been taken.
She contacted their two grown children, both college students, and Clark’s family in Michigan, and while everybody was making their way to San Diego, she heard from doctors that a decision might have to be made about letting him die.
It was something they had discussed when they were a couple. “He had always said he would want us to save his life, to keep fighting for his life,” she said. “So that’s what we did.”
While he was in a coma, his future uncertain, family members shut down the three Thrift Trader stores in San Diego. One of Clark’s friends let them use a warehouse in Escondido to store the merchandise.
The stores, which sold used CDs, clothes and other items, were quirky and beloved by many, including some who would come almost every day to see what was new on the shelves. Clark sometimes let homeless people sleep inside at night so they wouldn’t be on the sidewalks.
About 20 workers lost jobs when the stores closed, but that didn’t stop many of them from visiting Clark in the hospital. “He could have been like the average boss, with all these rules and regulations, ‘Do this and do that,’ but it was like a family there,” said Vicki Stein, who worked at the North Park store. “We were all pulling for him.”
Clark’s recovery came in fits and starts. He spent time in different care homes and rehabilitation centers until he got well enough to move back to his house in Clairemont.
When he looks back on that period now, he tears up remembering the support he got from family and friends. It breaks his heart a little to know that his elderly mother came out from her retirement facility in Michigan to see him when he was comatose, sat by his bed and held his hand, and then went home and died a few weeks later.
She never knew that Clark would regain consciousness, walk again, make it to the point where he’s so upfront about what happened that when he makes arrangements over the phone to meet in person with someone he doesn’t know — a reporter, say — this is how he describes himself:
“I’m 6’4 and I look like I got hit by a train.”
Moving forward
He greets people with his left arm outstretched, palm down. His right one doesn’t work well enough for handshakes.
At the gym, he moves slowly from one machine to the next. Sometimes he has to use his hands to lift one of his legs into position. His range of motion on most of the exercises is limited.
There is pity in the eyes of some of the other people there, but Clark doesn’t seem to notice. He talks instead about his progress, how he can lift more weight now than he could before.
“I’m getting stronger,” he said.
People who saw Clark right after the accident — when it seemed like he might not live, and if he did he might never walk again — sometimes express awe at how far he’s come.
And sometimes they don’t. They expected as much from him, because Clark has known upheaval before — married and divorced twice, separated from another longtime partner with whom he fathered a child, had court squabbles with roommates — and never seemed to let it keep him down.
“He will not give up,” Stein said. “He’s one of the most optimistic people I’ve ever known.”
Clark dreams about opening another used-goods store one day. He sometimes sells items at Kobey’s on weekends, to keep his hand in. “It’s therapy for me, more than it is about making money,” he said.
But mentally and physically, he still has a long way to go before running a store is possible, he said.
His singing feels further along to him. He’s recording himself for his phone’s voice-mail message again, something he used to do all the time. He’s thinking about which songs he might want to include on a CD.
“It’s a new voice, a new Jeff,” he said. “There’s a depth that wasn’t there before.”
But sometimes that dream feels beyond his immediate reach, too, so he tries to be patient. “I’m just going to sit in my car now and think about what I can do to move my life forward,” he said one day last week, after he finished his workout at the gym.
He leaned on his walker and pushed it slowly along the sidewalk to his minivan in the parking lot. He opened the tailgate, put the walker inside, and closed the hatch door, a process that took him several minutes.
Then he realized he had forgotten to put his gym bag inside. He sighed, and for a moment the idea of going through all those movements again seemed to defeat him.
But only for a moment.
“Sometimes it’s hard to believe this is my life now,” he said, and then he picked up the bag and remembered something a friend told him once in pain-management class.
“Believe it,” he said to himself out loud. “It’s happening.”

- Share via
As a safety precaution stemming from February’s Oxnard crash, the Metrolink board on Friday approved an agreement that will allow the commuter railroad to place locomotives at both ends of its trains.
Metrolink, which serves six Southern California counties, will spend $23.9 million to lease 40 engines for one year from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Co.
The locomotives will take the place of Metrolink’s new crash-resistant Hyundai Rotem cab cars -- passenger coaches that include an engineer’s compartment. Metrolink has 57 of the units, which are designed to absorb impacts when accidents occur.

Cab cars are used at the front of trains when they are being pushed from behind by locomotives--a common practice among the nation’s commuter railroads when trains reverse direction at the terminus of a line.
But investigators are now evaluating how well one cab car performed in the Feb. 24 Ventura County collision between a Metrolink train and a heavy-duty pickup truck and trailer at a crossing near Oxnard.
Officials say the lease will allow Metrolink to place heavier locomotives at both ends of trains until safety issues involving the cab cars are resolved. The units, however, will still be used to carry passengers.
“This is a preemptive measure taken out of an abundance of caution due to an unusual event,” said Art Leahy, Metrolink’s chief executive officer.
In the Oxnard crash, a train with a cab car in front derailed and several trailing coaches turned over on their sides, throwing passengers around their interiors. Twenty-eight people were injured, including the engineer, who later died.
Among other things, investigators are trying to determine if the cab car’s steel deflector, or cow catcher, failed during the collision, allowing wreckage to get under the wheels.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is looking into the accident, has yet to determine the probable cause of the crash. NTSB officials have declined to comment on the investigation.
Leahy said three other cab cars have been taken out of service “due to a potential safety issue.”
The crash represented a setback in Metrolink’s campaign to acquire advanced safety technology and rebuild public confidence after a 2008 head-on collision in Chatsworth that killed 28 people and injured 135.
The effort included a $263-million investment in a fleet of Hyundai Rotem coaches and cab cars, which have a variety of safety improvments such as stronger construction and energy-absorbing crush zones.
Following an internal report about the accident, rail officials announced in early September that they would limit the use of Rotem cab cars and seek to lease engines from Burlington Northern. Several weeks later, the board authorized renting the locomotives.
Without the lease, officials say, Metrolink service would have to be cut almost in half from 165 trains a day to 80 or 90.

The plan’s $23.9-million budget will be used to pay for the lease, fuel, maintenance, modifications and adapting the Burlington Northern engines to Metrolinks’ positive train control emergency braking system.

Shortly after 6 a.m., a motorist failed to navigate a turn and got his car struck on a stretch of rails near Palm and California streets in the Midtown district of San Diego, sheriff's Deputy Jeffrey Houser said.
The driver jumped out of the car and frantically signaled the operators of a northbound Amtrak train approaching at about 35 mph, its horn blaring, according to Houser.
The engineer braked, but was unable to stop the locomotive in time to keep it from plowing into and crushing the sedan.
Authorities closed the tracks in the area for about an hour while getting the mangled automobile off the railroad right of way, Houser said. A few Amtrak runs had to be canceled, but passengers were given the option of taking Coaster trains instead.
A similar non-injury accident played out about a dozen blocks to the north on Aug. 28.
About 9:30 a.m. that day, a truck driver stuck in a line of traffic leaped to safety just before a train smashed into his vehicle at a grade crossing on West Washington Street at Pacific Highway, near the eastern edge of San Diego International Airport.
The northbound Amtrak Surfliner hurled the box truck off the roadway and into a railroad-crossing sign, which in turn crashed down on and broke the windshield of a Metropolitan Transit District truck parked on the other side of a fence, authorities said.
A transit worker sitting in the MTS vehicle at the time escaped harm as well.
The driver of the cargo vehicle told reporters he had started crossing the rails on a green light, then found himself blocked in between stationary vehicles when the signal went to red.

- Share via
After a Metrolink commuter train slammed into a pickup truck near Oxnard this year, injuring 27 people and killing the engineer, railroad officials were quick to claim that new crash-resistant passenger coaches appeared to save lives and reduce injuries.
Now, however, Metrolink is trying to determine whether a design flaw in one of the state-of-the-art cars played a role in derailing the train.
The evaluation marks a setback in the regional passenger railroad’s campaign to employ advanced safety technology to help rebuild public confidence after a 2008 head-on collision in Chatsworth killed 28 and injured 135.
On Thursday, railroad officials announced that they will restrict the use of 57 of the new passenger cars that have control cabs for engineers and operate at the front of trains when they are being pushed from behind by locomotives.
The use of such “cab cars” is common practice among the nation’s commuter railroads when trains reverse direction at the end of a line.
While the railroad, which serves six Southern California counties, reexamines safety features on the cars, built by South Korea-based Hyundai Rotem Co., the vehicles will be replaced with locomotives leased from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Co. The cab cars will remain in service as passenger coaches used elsewhere in a train’s lineup of cars.
“We are taking this additional step as a redundancy to keep our riders safe,” said Metrolink Chief Executive Art Leahy. He added that the railroad is dedicated to becoming the safest in the nation.
Hyundai Rotem officials could not be reached for comment.
In February, a Metrolink train with a Rotem cab car in front derailed after hitting a pickup truck and trailer that strayed into a grade crossing at 5th Street and Rice Avenue outside of Oxnard.
Metrolink officials declared that the new cars with energy-absorbing crush zones, heavier construction and anti-derailing features helped reduce deaths and injuries. The agency’s $263-million investment in Rotem passenger and cab cars clearly paid off, they argued.
As part of its investigation, the railroad is trying
to determine whether a plow-like attachment on the front of the cab car failed in the collision and allowed wreckage to get under the wheels, triggering the derailment.
“We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution,” said Moorpark City Councilman Keith Millhouse, a member of the railroad’s board of directors. “This is an interim measure until the plow can be evaluated and beefed up if necessary. This is going to be costly for the railroad, but you can’t put a price on safety.”
Millhouse estimated that use of the cab cars will be restricted for a year before the issue is resolved.
Leahy said the railroad has been working with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Oxnard accident. Though there are concerns about the Rotem cab car plows, the NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the crash.
“This is very interesting,” said Paul Dyson, president of the Rail Passenger of Assn. of California who has questioned whether the new Rotem cars are as safe as officials say. “The plow is critical in keeping debris out from under the cars. Something was really wrong in Oxnard with the way the train jack-knifed. Passengers really got tossed around.”
Dyson contends that the cars’ energy-absorbing crush zones did not appear to lessen the force of the impact and that the couplers between cars did not keep coaches aligned as intended.
Since 2003, Metrolink has had four serious accidents, including three derailments, involving trains with cab cars in front. Sixteen people were killed and almost 360 injured in those crashes.
Though federal studies indicate there is minimal risk from the use of cab cars, some safety experts contend that having heavier locomotives in front reduces chances of derailment in an accident. They also have questioned Metrolink’s use of cab cars in a 512-mile system that contains hundreds of grade crossings and shares track with freight trains.
Tim Smith, the California legislative director for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, declined to comment on the Oxnard crash. In general, he said the union opposes the use of cab cars.
“We have felt they are dangerous,” Smith said. “Cab cars are light in weight and easy to lift off the tracks. As far as safety is concerned, we would like to have a locomotive out in front.”
Millhouse, however, defended the use of cab cars and said the new Rotem designs are superior to previous generations of such control cars.
Officials have praised the cars, saying that they include the latest safety features required by the federal government and that Metrolink is at the forefront of deploying the new technology.
Millhouse stressed that the temporary restrictions on the Rotem vehicles relate specifically to how the plow performed in the crash, not the larger debate over the safety of cab cars.

The man, who was between 20 and 30 years old, was cut into pieces by the northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train, which was travelling about 10mph (16km/h) at the time and was 62 cars long, Detective Ed Macken from San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said.
“He was be-bopping back and forth and there might have been phones up recording,” Macken said. “He was trying to do a manoeuvre to shoot under a train and it didn’t work.”
The train finally came to a stop about 35 miles (56km) north of the fatal incident.
Macken said the crossing gates were down and warning lights were flashing when the accident happened.
The death highlighted an ongoing problem with open, very visible and accessible train corridors in San Diego County, Macken said.

Shaun William Riddle, 27, was attempting to hook a vehicle stalled at Chesterfield Drive and South Coast Highway 101 to the flatbed tow truck about 2:35 p.m. Saturday, according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office.
Riddle was apparently assisting the owner of a broken-down SUV just west of the tracks, sheriff's officials said.
A southbound Surfliner train approached the intersection and Riddle got back into the truck to move it out of the train's path, but could not do so, the Medical Examiner's Office reported.
The train was traveling at a high rate of speed when it struck the tow truck, which reportedly was between closed crossing arms, authorities said. The rig was demolished.
Riddle died at the scene, the Medical Examiner's Office said.

The crash happened around 2:35 p.m. at Chesterfield Drive and South Coast Highway 101.
According to Encinitas deputies, the driver of the tow truck had stopped on the railroad tracks to assist a disabled SUV that was stalled just west of the tracks.
A short time later, an Amtrak train approached. The tow truck was unable to move in time and was struck by the train.
The driver of the tow truck sustained fatal injuries and died at the scene, deputies said.
The crash is under investigation
At 3:35 p.m., North County Transit took to their Twitter page to also confirm the collision, tweeting: ""Due to an incident on the tracks involving Amtrak, COASTER may experience a delay.""
One local witness said he saw the SUV on the flatbed tow truck, both stalled on the tracks. The witness said the train crossing arm dropped on the SUV and a moment later, the train slammed into the tow truck.
The witness caught the entire crash on tape. The video shows the truck driver’s door closing and then the truck turning away from the train just moments before the collision.
A witness who works across the street from the train tracks said the sound of the fatal crash was horrific.
“It's somewhere between an explosion and thunder. You know, when metal hits metal it makes a noise unto itself,” explained witness Thomas Neely.
The white SUV was left in place at the intersection.
Moments after the crash, people nearby tried to help and scrambled to find survivors.
One witness said the driver was ejected from his tow truck and thrown some 100 yards from the crash site. On the witness video, people seemed to cover the body of the victim while waiting for emergency crews to arrive.
“Anybody else back there?” a person searching for survivors at the crash site says on the video.
Another resident who lives near the site of the crash told NBC 7 that the impact from the collision shook his whole house.
It’s unclear how fast the train was traveling at impact, but the southbound Amtrak train came to a stop about half a mile away from the Chesterfield Drive crossing.
Pieces of the tow truck were strewn around the train tracks for hundreds of yards after the crash, including the flatbed, a wheel and even the massive engine block that landed about 200 yards away.
Numerous workers from the company TOWEX later arrived at the scene. The towing company responds to AAA calls.
The company told NBC 7 it wants to respect the privacy of the victim’s family, so his name was not released. One source confirmed the man had a wife and young daughter.
Local
The Medical Examiner’s office will identify the victim at a later time.
Most people nearby were saddened to hear that a man lost his life in the crash on the train tracks, including Neely.
“I'm sorry to hear that a mother lost her son, especially during the holidays. There's never a good time but it's just, it's tragic,” said Neely.
The two women who drove the SUV were not injured.

Nine people were injured in the incident in the East Bay between the Orinda and Lafayette stations [see “Nine injured as BART train derails,” Trains News Wire, Jan. 1, 2024], which saw two cars catch fire after derailing.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Shane Edwards, BART assistant general manager for operations, said a “field interface protocol failure” meant BART’s operations control center was unable to remotely control the interlocking between the two stations, requiring the train operator to leave the train to manually align a switch. The operator reported having properly aligned the track, but control center was unable to tell if that was correct. BART subsequently reported that the train initially started onto the wrong track, and that the derailment occurred while the train was reversing directions to correct that error [see “BART train briefly head on to wrong track …,” News Wire, Jan. 5, 2024].
Edwards told the BART board the damage at the derailment scene was far less than it could have been because the track had been replaced within the last three years. Otherwise, he said, “The existing infrastructure probably would have been completely destroyed. As it turns out, the damage in this case, although it looked catastrophic, was quite minimal.”

OAKLAND, Calif. (KTVU) - Bassist Marc van Wageningen spoke to KTVU for the first time on Tuesday, one day before he is set to perform at Yoshi’s in Oakland for the first time since a train accident nearly killed him.
Van Wageningen, known as Marc VW, said he feels at home behind a bass guitar and is excited for his returning performance Wednesday night. He noted that he has already crossed the train tracks a couple of times with his family about a month ago in the same area where he was hit to “get it out of his system.”
On Jan. 12, 2017, van Wageningen and Tower of Power drummer David Garibaldi were hit by a train in Oakland as they were crossing Embarcadero before their scheduled performance at Yoshi’s. Marc was set to fill in with the band that night.
The 59-year-old spend two months in intensive care and continues to recover.
“I have to give credit to Highland Hospital because they literally saved my life,” van Wageningen said. “Apparently I was bleeding to death. They found the cause of it. It turned out to be my spleen, which was ruptured. It was just bleeding.”
He does not remember much from that night.
It has been a long road to recovery for van Wageningen and Garibaldi. Close friend and fellow musician Peter Michael Escovedo calls van Wageningen’s recovery miraculous.
“I would not call it anything else because nothing else makes sense for two people to get hit by a train and both survive,” Escovedo said.
Escovedo held a benefit concert for Marc VW a week after the accident and formed The Marc VW All Stars. The band recorded a CD called “Raise the Marc” to help cover the cost of medical bills. The group will perform for the songs on Wednesday night.
“It's a welcome back to Marc,” Escovedo said. “This is his first time playing these songs and its actually all of our first times playing together, and live, so it's going to be a special event.”
As for Tower of Power drummer, David Garibaldi, a message is posted on the Tower of Power website, announcing his official return to the band. Part of the message reads:
“The entire TOP Organization along with the Garibaldi and van Wageningen families wish to thank all of our fans and friends for the outpouring of love and support.”
Garibaldi and the band is currently on tour in Europe. Tower of Power will kick off their 50th anniversary tour in January 2018.
“We were friends before that, but the accident kind of bonded us for life,” van Wageningen said. “All I can say is thank you [to the fans]. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the thoughts and help for the both of us.”
The Marc VW All Stars is set to perform at 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday at Yoshi’s in Oakland.

According to the Stockton Police Department, the 62-year-old man was struck by a train around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 8, along the 800 block of South Lincoln Street near Columbus Park.
The pedestrian has not yet been identified.
At the scene Tuesday night, police blocked off Lincoln Street for several hours as evidence technicians assessed the area, gathering information. The train involved was stopped on the tracks for multiple hours blocking Lincoln Street traffic in both directions from Scotts Avenue to Worth Street.
According to city maps, the railroad where the crash happened belongs to BNSF Railway, a freight transportation company that operates 32,500 miles of railroads nationwide.
The company responded to a request for comment Wednesday confirming that one of their eastbound trains struck the pedestrian. BNSF spokesperson Lena Kent says the cause of the crash is now under investigation.

A homeless man was struck and killed by a train Monday while trying to rescue his dog apparently stuck on railroad tracks, according to witnesses and Tulare police.
Both the man and dog were dead when officers arrived around 8 a.m. at the railroad tracks near Cross Avenue and J Street, Tulare Police Sgt. Edward Hinojosa said.
The victim's name is being withheld until his family is notified, though officers confirmed that he was a resident of a nearby homeless encampment.
""Witnesses reported that it appeared a man was struggling with his dog on the tracks when they were both struck by a northbound train,"" Hinojosa said. ""The circumstances are not clear but it is believed that the dog may have been stuck in the tracks and the man was trying to free him.""
The railroad crossing sits near a large homeless encampment on land that is under Union Pacific's jurisdiction. City officials say railroad leaders have been ""uncooperative"" in attempts to clear unsafe camps from the right of way.
""The railroad has somewhat ignored our pleas to not let encampments grow to dangerous levels,"" Tulare Mayor Dennis Mederos said. ""The city has tried to work with the railroad to take steps to not have people experiencing homelessness in areas that can be dangerous.
""We were concerned that someone could die as a result of what's taking place.""
On Monday, the predicted tragedy happened. Streets in the area were closed for hours as the stopped train blocked the roadway.
Union Pacific representatives could not be reached for comment. The company operates 32,300 miles of freight lines in the United States, according to its website.
Railroads play an outsized role in Tulare's history. The city was founded in 1872 by the Southern Pacific Railroad to serve as its San Joaquin Valley headquarters. A train features prominently in the city's logo.
""The death that occurred this morning shows the problem that we're dealing with and the urgency that this situation requires,"" the mayor said. He added that the city council has scheduled a special meeting in June to address the encampment and find solutions for Tulare's homeless issue.
Monday's death is at least the second to affect unhoused Tulareans this year.
In February, a homeless woman was hit and killed while crossing Highway 99 on foot. The accident prompted Tulare city leaders to lobby Caltrans to clear a large encampment on the side of the highway near the Prosperity Boulevard exit.
The state agency typically doesn't sweep homeless camps on their property unless local jurisdictions have rooms available for the evicted people to stay. An exception was made because of the size and danger posed by the Tulare camp, officials said at the time.
While Project Roomkey and Homekey have created some rooms for unsheltered people during the coronavirus pandemic, those locations are full. Traditional housing programs such as Section 8, meanwhile, have waiting lists that stretch up to 10,000 families, according to an annual Tulare County Housing Authority report.

Wood Chipper Incident Stalls Train Travel Through Santa Barbara - The Santa Barbara Independent,"A train versus wood chipper collision on the railroad tracks just south of El Capitan State Beach closed the rail corridor through Santa Barbara for about two hours while Union Pacific crews inspected the tracks, Amtrak spokesperson Puja Thomas-Patel said on Friday. From photos taken by Santa Barbara County Fire, the train suffered a crunched nose on the engine and scrapes to the side of the cars, but remained on the tracks. The passengers, however, are derailed until alternate transportation can be arranged.
The crash happened at 10:41 a.m. when the driver of the truck pulling the wood chipper was apparently caught unawares, S.B. County Fire spokesperson Captain Scott Safechuck said.

The coroner’s office identified the victim as Mariana Reinoso-Barreto of San Mateo. The fatal accident occurred near the Villa Terrace at-grade crossing in San Mateo.
Only six days earlier, Caltrain officials celebrated the start of electric train service.
The coroner’s office hasn’t determined if the death was an accident or a suicide.
This was the 12th death on the Caltrain tracks this year. Between 1992 and 2009, Caltrain averaged 10 deaths a year, according to research by the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University.
In May, Caltrain decided to stop reporting deaths that occur on the tracks in the hopes they would diminish. San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus, whose office has the contract to provide police services for the Caltrain line from San Francisco to Gilroy, went along with Caltrain’s censorship decision even though other first-responder agencies, such as police and fire departments, have not.
The news blackout doesn’t appear to be reducing deaths, since this is the 12th fatality on the tracks in 2024, which is higher than the average for an entire year, and it’s only the ninth month of the year.
Passengers report train deaths on social media, and some news outlets, such as the Daily Post, confirm the deaths through other official sources such as fire departments and coroners.

As of noon, Palo Alto police report that the Meadow Drive crossing is closed as authorities investigate the train death.
Also under investigation is the death of a woman at around 9 p.m. at Embarcadero and Newell Road.
After receiving a 911 call, police and firefighters found a woman in her 20s unconscious in the roadway. Despite life-saving efforts, Fire Department personnel pronounced the woman dead at the scene.
Police said a preliminary investigation revealed that the woman had been stopped astride her bicycle in the number one lane of eastbound Embarcadero Road at the crosswalk at Newell Road. Police believe it is possible she may have been waiting for a green arrow to turn left onto northbound Newell Road. The cyclist was struck from behind by a blue 2023 Honda Accord traveling eastbound in the number one lane of Embarcadero Road on a green signal. It was lightly raining at the time of the collision.
The force of the initial collision knocked the cyclist into the intersection, where, according to witnesses, she was then struck by two additional eastbound vehicles. Neither of those vehicles stopped and continued traveling eastbound. Detectives have identified four vehicles that were eastbound at the same time and are actively conducting follow-up investigation on those vehicles and their drivers to see which two struck the woman.
The driver of the Accord, an adult male in his teens, remained at the scene and cooperated with police. The Accord was equipped with a dash-cam that captured the initial collision in its entirety. Neither drugs nor alcohol appear to be factor in the initial collision.
Police are asking that anyone who may have witnessed the collision to call them at (650) 329-2413.

Tesla driver gets minor injuries after train crashes into EV: report
There are several things that drivers never want to be involved in. A crash with a train is definitely one of them. Fortunately for a driver in Santa Clara, she happened to be inside a Tesla, and she was able to escape the frightening ordeal with minor injuries.
The incident happened on Wednesday morning when a Capitol Corridor train smashed into what appears to be a Midnight Silver Tesla Model Y on the 600 block of Martin Avenue in Santa Clara. Videos taken of the incident’s aftermath show a crushed Tesla with its airbags deployed.
As noted in a report from NBC Bay Area, the driver of the Tesla reportedly tried to beat the train through the crossing — an incredibly dangerous move and one that could have easily claimed a life. According to witnesses interviewed by the news outlet, the Tesla driver was reportedly sitting on the tracks when the crossing arm came down on the vehicle.
The Tesla driver reportedly seemed distracted when the crossing arm hit the electric car. Witnesses were then shocked to see the driver reportedly exit the vehicle to move the arm off the Tesla. The driver then reportedly tried to beat the train but was unsuccessful. The train smashed into the all-electric vehicle, and its parts ended up being thrown in all directions.
Despite the Tesla driver’s apparent carelessness and recklessness, she was ultimately lucky. One driver, Emilio Martinez, whose vehicle was hit by a large section of the Tesla, was actually a licensed EMT, so he ended up being the first responder on the scene. The Tesla driver didn’t respond to the EMT at first, though later statements from the police indicated that the EV driver only sustained minor injuries. No passengers from the train were injured during the crash as well.
Ultimately, crashes such as this are among the reasons why Tesla is pushing the development of technologies like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. Systems like FSD tend to drive conservatively and cautiously, and they do not get distracted. Thus, when solutions such as FSD are fully rolled out, instances of accidents from distracted drivers would likely see a notable decline.

NY Democrats take aim at Tesla direct sales licenses in New York
Democratic Senator Patricia Fahy is pushing to revoke a legislative waiver that allows Tesla to operate five NY locations without using dealer franchises.
Democratic New York State Senator Patricia Fahy, once a Tesla ally, is currently pushing to revoke a legislative waiver that allows the electric vehicle maker to operate five New York locations without using dealer franchises.
Fahy cited CEO Elon Musk’s role in President Donald Trump’s administration as a reason for her change of heart.
Fahy’s Shift in Stance
For 12 years, Fahy frequently supported Tesla’s fight to bypass New York’s franchise dealer regulations. But after Elon Musk personally took Donald Trump’s side, and after he worked as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Fahy no longer supports the EV maker. Apart from her anti-Tesla efforts in the State Capitol, the Senator has also participated in demonstrations against a planned Tesla dealership in Colonie, as noted in a report from the New York Times.
“Maybe I’m making amends,” Fahy stated, describing Musk as “part of an administration that is killing all the grant funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, killing wind energy, killing anything that might address climate change. Why should we give them a monopoly?”
Fahy has introduced legislation that would effectively end Tesla’s direct sales operations in New York, as noted in a Syracuse.com report. Her bill argues that Tesla’s legislative waiver provides the EV maker with an unfair advantage. Thus, Fahy wants Tesla to forfeit its five licenses by 2026. The licenses could then be redistributed to other EV makers that also sell directly to consumers, such as Rivian, Lucid, and Scout Motors.
Republican Opposition
Republican New York Senator Jacob Ashby has described Senator Fahy’s bill as misguided, arguing that the “government should not be picking winners and losers on this.” Ashby also noted that “political disdain seems to be more at play. We are not recognizing the power and implications of the process that we have and that we should trust it.”
Colonie town supervisor Peter Crummey, also a Republican, stated that “though political sentiments appear to have recently changed for some folks about Tesla’s founder, people should let the Planning Board do their work.” As for requests from state legislators who are inserting themselves into the Tesla issue, Crummer noted that “I am confident we will give them the weight it deserves.”

Possible first glimpse of Tesla “Model 2” affordable car in Fremont Factory
The models that Tesla will release in the coming months will resemble the company’s current lineup.
During the Q1 earnings call, Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy set expectations on the design of the affordable models that the company is expected to launch this 2025. As per the Tesla executive, the models that Tesla will release in the coming months will resemble the company’s current lineup.
Drone footage from the Fremont Factory earlier this month might have provided the EV community its first potential glimpse at Tesla’s affordable cars–fondly dubbed by EV fans and analysts as the “Model 2” or even “Model Q”–or at least their components and overall shape.
The Sighting
Tesla watcher and drone operator Met God in Wilderness, who has been posting aerial videos of the Fremont Factory for years now, recently shared some footage from his drone flyovers this month. While the Fremont Factory was abuzz with activity as usual, a couple of rather strange vehicles were quickly spotted by EV watchers on social media.
During the drone operator’s flyover on the 17th, for example, an unfinished vehicle could be seen parked next to what appeared to be fully-built Model S and Model Y units. What was especially interesting was the vehicle’s roof, which seemed to be slightly narrower than the Model Ys around it. Based on the video, at least, the vehicle seemed to be shaped like a crossover as well.
Footage from the 24th of April also proved quite interesting, with the drone operator capturing footage of another cryptic vehicle. Unlike the mysterious, unfinished, crossover-esque car spotted on the 17th, this particular unit seemed to have a more sloping rear, at least based on the shape of its covering.
What Lars Moravy Said
In Tesla’s Q1 2025 Update Letter, Tesla noted that “plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.” Tesla also noted that the new vehicles will utilize aspects of its next generation and its current platforms. They will also be produced on the same manufacturing lines as its present vehicle lineup, likely the Model Y and Model 3.
During the earnings call itself, Moravy specifically stated that the new models that would come out in the next months would resemble the company’s current vehicles. They will, however, be affordable. “Models that come out in next months will be built on our lines and will resemble, in form and shape, the cars we currently make. And the key is that they’ll be affordable, and you’ll be able to buy one,” Moravy stated.
Watch the drone operator’s footage from April 17 below.

California proposal to allow self-driving tests for heavy-duty trucks
A new proposal in the state of California would allow initial testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks, as Tesla and others aim to bring their driverless technologies to market with Class 8 trucks and other large vehicles.
On Friday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said that it’s proposing self-driving vehicle tests be allowed on public roads for heavy-duty trucks and other large vehicles, as detailed in a report from Reuters. The news comes as heavy-duty vehicles about 10,001 pounds are currently unable to utilize public self-driving tests in California, as well as others such as Texas, Arizona, and Arkansas.
The proposal would restrict autonomous testing for semi-trucks and other oversized vehicles to specified, pre-selected routes that would be pre-determined to be legal for size, weight, and loading requirements. It would also ban testing these vehicles on city streets, with selected routes primarily including major highways.
The state would also prohibit testing of specific heavy-duty vehicles until further notice under the proposal, including household movers, commercial vehicles used to transport passengers, oversize loads, bulk liquids, or hazardous materials.
👀 A look inside Tesla’s Semi factory
— TESLARATI (@Teslarati) March 8, 2025
READ MORE ON SELF-DRIVING FOR HEAVY-DUTY TRUCKS:
The DMV plans to hold a public hearing on the proposal on June 10, after which point it would be allowed to move forward with the agency.
California has been preparing regulations for autonomous trucking since at least last August, when the state submitted an initial draft for such a legal framework.
The state is also evaluating whether light-duty vehicle testing requirements should be updated. Currently, the state requires a permit to test self-driving vehicles utilizing a safety driver, before applying for subsequent phases of driverless testing and deployment permits.
To apply for driverless testing permits, manufacturers are required to conduct testing for a minimum of 50,000 miles, while heavy-duty manufacturers would be required to complete at least 500,000 autonomous testing miles under the proposal. Of them, up to 40,000 of the miles are allowed to be completed outside of California.
The news also follows the Trump administration’s aims to accelerate self-driving deployment this week through the expansion of exemptions for certain reporting requirements.
Although Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) is not currently available for the company’s electric Semi, it’s expected to become available at some point in the future. Tesla has also been spotted testing its FSD on the Semi in and around Giga Nevada, ahead of the company’s plans to launch the software on the Class 8 truck.
Tesla is currently aiming to ramp up production of the Semi, and it’s constructing an expansion to its Gigafactory in Nevada to eventually scale up to volume production.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (KTVU) - Investigators are releasing more details about a local boy fatally struck by an Amtrak train over the weekend.
On Tuesday Santa Clara County officials identified the 5-year-old boy as Leonardo Shiyanga-Omani, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
Santa Clara Police Department said dispatchers received reports of a child running on the tracks near Lafayette Street south of Laurelwood Road.
Police said dispatchers immediately notified Union Pacific and asked them to stop all train service in the area, but it was too late.
Police believe Leonardo was playing in his parents' back yard when he apparently removed a couple of boards in the fence that surrounded the yard. The boy left the yard and got onto the tracks without his parents' knowledge.
The boy's parents were inside the home at the time he was struck. He was alone on the tracks when he was struck.
Santa Clara police said it appears the boy was gone only a few minutes before someone saw him near the tracks. The boy's parents have cooperated in the police investigation and told officers their son had special needs.
Santa Clara police investigators said the fatal collision happened near Lafayette Street and the Highway 101 underpass as the freeway runs below the tracks.
“A lot of us have kids. And this is something that really has a pit in our stomach,” said Capt. Wahid Kazem, a spokesman for the Santa Clara Police Department.
He said around 4:20 p.m. his department started receiving calls about a small boy, unsupervised, near the tracks. Then, a 911 call saying a northbound Amtrak train hit the child. First responders arrived and found the boy injured.
“The collision appears to be an accident. Whether there’s any other negligence involved, again, is the subject of our investigation,“ said Kazem.
Area residents were shocked by the death.
“Yeah, it doesn't make no sense why a kid that young is running around here, all alone,” said area neighbor Kenneth Masoner.
Investigators and residents said, although there are incidents of adults being hit by trains, they can’t remember the last time such a young child was hit, if ever.
“I ain’t never seen no children out here by themselves. You rarely see teenagers. You know, you don’t see teenagers. It’s pretty much a business district around here,” said Masoner.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (KTVU) - VTA and police are cracking down on scofflaws at a light rail crossing in the South Bay after two people were hit by trains this summer, including a 14-year-old girl.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies on Tuesday will be citing car, bikes, and pedestrians if they ignore traffic lights, safety warnings, and gates at the at the Stokes Avenue light rail crossing.
That's where 14-year-old Michelle Espinoza was hit by on July 10. She is now slowly recovering from numerous injuries that include a fractured skull and broken ribs. Her family is still trying to figure how this happened.
Authorities say Michelle was riding her bike and went around the crossing barriers, and ended up getting hit by a train was making its way through the intersection.
""All we know is that we're thankful she's alive and she's fighting. She's very strong,"" her sister Eliana Espinoza said.
VTA spokeswoman Holly Perez said that everyone needs to pay attention and not skirt the signs.
""Often times, you may not see or hear a bus coming,"" she said. ""So it's important you look both directions.""
Michelle's family says a good Samaritan pulled her off the track and gave her CPR.
They don't know who that person is, but they want to thank them for their help.
The VTA says the crackdown is part of the agency's annual safety campaign every September.
They say light rail operators keep seeing people distracted by their phones or simply ignoring the lights and crossing arms at the tracks. That is against the law.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (KTVU) - The family of a teenage San Jose girl hit and critically injured by a VTA light rail train on Wednesday is asking for the public’s help determining how the accident happened.
Family members say Michelle Espinoza is an effervescent 14-year-old with an infectious personality. She remains at Valley Medical Center where she is fighting for her life.
“It’s hard. We can’t believe this happened. We wanna know how it happened,” said Liliana Rosas, the girl’s aunt.
Rosas and other family members sat outside the hospital Friday morning, trying to make sense of it all.
Espinoza clings to life in critical condition, with a fractured skull, swelling of the brain, broken ribs and clavicle, and other injuries.
Late Wednesday morning, Espinoza was riding her bike near Southwest Expressway and Stokes Street. She was hit by a VTA light rail train as it made its way through the intersection.
“All we know is that we’re thankful she’s alive and she’s fighting. She’s very strong,” said Eliana Espinoza, Michelle’s older sister.
San Jose police say the teen was riding her bike east on Stokes Street and went around the crossing barriers, which were functioning. She peddled across the tracks, but there’s no explanation as to how or why she was hit by the southbound train. VTA officials stress being situationally aware when near or using their system.
“Often times, you may not see or hear a bus coming. So it’s important you look both directions,"" said Holly Perez, a VTA spokeswoman. ""Remove the distractions like earbuds, and really follow the directional signs. Whether it’s lights, directional signs or crossing gates.""
After Espinoza was struck, family member say a Good Samaritan pulled her off the tracks and administered CPR.
In the family's search for answers to the accident, they want to personally thank the stranger who may have helped save a 14-year-old’s life.
“We would love for the person who helped her to come forward. And we would like to meet them, and thank them and just give them a big hug,” said Eliana Espinoza.

(KGO) -- It is still a mystery why a driver crossed light rail tracks in San Jose on Sunday when the crossing arms were down. Two men, the driver of the car and a passenger, were both killed.
Four lanes of traffic cross the VTA tracks on Lincoln Avenue. When the crossing arms descend, they completely block vehicles from proceeding.
RELATED: Deadly crash prompts delays on VTA in San Jose
However, it appears the driver of a gold Buick Regal decided not to stop and wait for the light rail train to pass.
Surveillance video taken by a camera at Hapa's Brewery, which sits adjacent to tracks, shows the car going around the crossing arms and getting struck by the northbound train, causing the train to derail while pushing the car down the track.
Investigators from San Jose police say there's no question what happened.
""The crossing arms were down and the driver went around it. And that's when the train collided with the car,"" said San Jose Police Sgt. Enrique Garcia.
Witnesses were shocked by what they saw. ""We all went out to the car and the dude was barely breathing,"" said Ryan Stern. ""People were telling him to stay with him but it's pretty hard to survive a wreck like that.""
Jose Zarate was one of about 20 passengers on the train.
""It felt like a tin can was like just crunching it,"" recalled Zarate. ""You see the walls coming down on you. You don't know what to expect. I didn't know if it was a bomb. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know it was car, until after.""
In the surveillance video, the car seems to be going straight on the wrong side of the street, but before zig-zagging to get across the tracks, the train hit the car.
It is not easy to get around the crossing arms at this location. Concrete dividers separate the two sides of Lincoln Avenue approaching the crossing. There's a second concrete barrier between the tracks.
Police say there's no excuse for ignoring crossing arms.
""Even if they look in both directions, they don't know how fast the train could be coming,"" said Sgt. Garcia. ""Maybe there's a blind spot, maybe there's a curb. There's a lot of factors. It would be prudent for people to wait.""

Williams’ truck was struck, turned over and pushed along the tracks by a railroad maintenance vehicle on the Union Pacific line at Masten Avenue and Monterey Road in north Gilroy while safety crossing arms designed to stop traffic were in the upright position, according to the California Highway Patrol.
The corner’s office listed the cause of death as “Positional Asphyxia.” It means the victim was trapped in the vehicle in a position that rendered him unable to breath, a spokesperson for the office said.
The victim’s name and identification had been withheld by authorities pending notification of his family.
Railroad employees at the north Gilroy scene Jan. 9 told investigators that malfunctions of the safety arms during maintenance are common, a CHP officer told the Dispatch.
The driver of the railroad vehicle was identified as Lindberg Thompson, 57, of Grants, N. M. He was not injured, the CHP said.
Union Pacific did not returned repeated phone calls seeking infornmation about the accident. But in an emailed response to a Dispatch query emailed to the company, a spokesman for Union Pacific Railroad expressed “sympathies to those affected by last week’s tragic accident.
“Safety is a main priority for Union Pacific”, wrote Jeff DeGraff. He said the accident is being investigated “thoroughly” but provided no further detail.
Williams’ silver 2008 Toyota Tacoma was westbound on Masten Avenue and crossing the tracks at around 12:58 pm when it was struck by a Union Pacific railroad maintenance vehicle headed southbound on the tracks that parallel Monterey Road, according to a CHP report on the collision.
“Railroad personnel on scene made statements that ‘it happens all the time’ with these vehicles that the arms don’t go down…It’s a common occurrence,” CHP Officer Herb Kellogg said.
Roughly 20 minutes before the collision, Morgan Hill resident Lolita Cavinta said she witnessed the railroad crossing arms at the intersection of Monterey Road and Church Avenue—2 miles from the crash scene—failed to stay down as maintenance vehicles passed by.
“One maintenance vehicle came by and another came by, and then the arms went up,” she said. “But I saw there were at least two others on the tracks. I asked my mom, ‘Do I go? I see them coming but the arms went up, which means you’re supposed to go.’ I had to guess because I saw them coming—and they weren’t stopping. So I just went for it. I didn’t want to get hit.”
Cavinta said she didn’t see the crossing arms go down after she’d crossed. Twenty minutes later, she checked her phone and learned of the fatal collision that took place nearby.
“I probably saw the guy who hit that truck because he probably went by while I was waiting there to turn onto Church,” she added. “If the arms weren’t working during whatever maintenance they were doing, they should have had somebody out there warning cars to stop or something.”
Authorities do not suspect that alcohol or drugs played a role in the collision at this time and no arrests were made, Kellogg said.",Union Pacific,Santa Clara County Corner-Medical Examiner,California Highway Patrol,Unknown,Jan. 9,12:58 pm,Unknown,Unknown,Santa Clara County,CA,Unknown,Masten Avenue,D,Unknown,3,3,Unknown,Unknown,2,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,7,5,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Common occurrence,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Danika, a freshman at Del Mar High School in San Jose, was hit while bicycling Friday around 7:35 a.m. near Stokes Street and Southwest Expressway on her way to a singing performance at her school, according to her cousin Jessica Williams.
According to Williams, Danika was rushing to get to the performance on time when she was struck.
Her family waited at a hospital for several hours before they were told Danika had suffered fatal injuries and lost too much blood in the accident, according to Williams.
An online fundraising website has been set up to raise $10,000 to go toward funeral and memorial services.
A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Willow Glen Funeral Home at 1039 Lincoln Ave. in San Jose. A reception will follow the service at the Fraternal Order of Eagles Hall across the street.
On Monday, a burial procession will begin at 10 a.m. at the Willow Glen Funeral Home and arrive around 11 a.m. at the Oak Hill Cemetery at 300 Curtner Ave. in San Jose.
On the website, Williams wrote, ""The entire family is deeply saddened by the loss of our sweet dear Danika.""
Danika leaves behind her parents and a brother who is in fifth grade.
As of Thursday morning nearly $7,300 had been raised on the site.
After the high school learned about the incident, additional grief counselors were made available to students and staff, Campbell Union High School District spokesman Michael Posey said.
Support staff continues to be available for students and staff this week, he said.
An informal vigil took place at the site of the crash Saturday night, which is near the school.
A growing memorial with candles, teddy bears, and signs has gone on the side of the school near the train tracks in honor of Danika.

Monday night’s train accident
Morgan Hill – Friends and co-workers of 18-year-old Jackie Gamboa gathered at a wooden cross near the railroad tracks Tuesday at San Pedro Avenue to pray and remember the radiant young woman, killed when the truck she was riding in was struck by an oncoming commuter train Monday night.
“If I wish I could have loved anyone, it would have been her,” said Robert Brancato, who came to the site to pay his respects to his friend.
Those who loved the petite teen all painted the same picture of her: Sweet. Happy. Beautiful.
“She was such a sweet, sweet girl,” said Carlota Martinez who worked with Gamboa at Fox Racing. “A beautiful lady.”
After learning of the death of her co-worker, Martinez and others came to the cross to grieve.
“We saw her yesterday. It’s very hard for us. We come to pray for her,” she said. “This morning when we got to work we found out. We’ve been crying all day for her.”
Michelle Ramirez, human resources manager, said Friday that when the announcement was made in the company about Gamboa’s death, employees were told that counseling referrals would be available if needed.
Meanwhile, Morgan Hill police are investigating the accident, which left the driver of the pick up, Morgan Hill resident Nathan Schrock, 20, in critical condition. He regained consciousness Tuesday but remains in serious but stable condition, police said Friday.
According to friends, Gamboa and Schrock had been a couple for the past three years.
The complete investigation may take months, as police wait to speak with Schrock, who witnesses say drove through warning signals and around closed gates at the crossing. The couple’s GMC Sonoma was struck by a southbound commuter train, which Schrock apparently never saw coming, police said.
Now he may face vehicle manslaughter charges for apparently attempting to beat the train across the tracks, punishable by up to six years in prison.
The incidents leading up to the tragic accident began about 7pm as Schrock headed southbound on Railroad Avenue. When he got to Tennant Avenue he saw the railroad arms down for an oncoming northbound freight train, according to police.
Schrock and a truck in front of him both made U-turns and headed back north on Railroad, apparently in an attempt to beat the northbound train to the next intersection at San Pedro Avenue, police said.
When they arrived the gates were down, police said, and Schrock was behind the other truck at the crossing.
Witnesses told police that he apparently became impatient and drove around the pickup in front of him and around the railroad arms. The driver of the first pickup yelled for Schrock to stop. A second train heading southbound saw the pickup and tried to stop, but plowed through the truck, splitting it in half. The bed of the truck ended up 150 feet down the rails.
Gamboa was ejected from the truck and pronounced dead at the scene. Schrock suffered serious trauma to the head and a gash to the thigh. He was flown to Regional Medical Center in San Jose.
Police are waiting for toxicology and alcohol reports for Schrock, which may take several weeks.
“Obviously, he is a big part of the investigation, and we cannot interview him when he is medicated or in any kind of altered state of consciousness,” said Cmdr. Joe Sampson of the Morgan Hill Police Department. “This is very sad. Two young lives have really been destroyed. He will have to live forever with this.”
Once he is interviewed and test results are available, a full report will be given to the District Attorney’s office which will determine whether or not to press manslaughter charges. Passing through activated railroad warning signs is illegal.
The engineer is being provided with counseling services. Rail traffic was stopped until the train was released about 10pm.
“This is just an unfortunate and tragic error in judgment in the part of this young man,” Sampson said.
Family members consoled each other Tuesday and declined to speak with the reporters for South Valley Newspapers, saying that the matter was private.
“It’s a tragedy,” friends said as they gathered on the sidewalks of the Gamboa home. They erected a large wooden cross with pictures of the beautiful young woman at various stages of her young life. It was later placed at the San Pedro Avenue crossing.
News of Gamboa’s death caused staff members to break into tears at Mount Madonna Continuation High School, where she graduated last year.
Journalism teacher Marina Campos grew very close with Gamboa during her senior year.
“I want to give my condolences to the family,” she said clasping a tissue. “She was like a shining light … She was radiant … She was just that one student you just won’t forget. I won’t forget. You won’t forget her face, you just won’t forget her smile.”
Campos described a student eager to please her teachers, making sure she did the job right – a woman whose personality was bigger than her petite frame.
“The essence of her beauty was just the type of person she was,” Campos said. “I am just shocked. This is probably the second time in my career that I can really feel the pain – and it’s not easy. I feel very much for the family. I would tell her, ‘Jackie – I love you,’ And I meant it. I meant it every time.”
Gamboa worked in the front office with Mt. Madonna staff and was close to former Principal John Perales, who met frequently with her and her mother to work with her towards reaching her goal of graduating.
She spoke of one day attending junior college.
“Her boyfriend I know, was a big part of her life,” he said. “I just remember her passion for life. She just loved spending time with her family and friends. We spent a lot of time together dreaming and justifying why she was working so hard,” he said. “Nothing was impossible for Jackie. She could conquer the world tomorrow.”",San Pedro Avenue,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Friday, after the announcement",After 7pm,Unknown,Morgan Hill,California,CA,Morgan Hill,Railroad Avenue,D,Unknown,2,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,E,2,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Narrative Description: Jackie Gamboa was a radiant, sweet, and happy young woman who worked in the front office at Mt.

UPDATE - Redding police say a preliminary investigation revealed that a semi-truck driven by a 25-year-old man from Washington was attempting to cross the tracks at Highway 273 and Breslauer Way, when the semi-trailer became stuck on the track.
The semi-truck was hauling a large Caterpillar tractor on a low clearance trailer, the Redding Police Department said. The driver of the semi-truck and trailer was attempting to free the trailer from the tracks, blocking the train tracks and roadway.
Meanwhile, a Union Pacific train traveling southbound was unable to slow or stop prior to the train striking the semi-trailer and large tractor. As a result of the collision, the tractor was thrown from the trailer, striking the railroad crossing arm controls, causing major damage. Per witness statements, the semi-truck and trailer had been stuck on the railroad crossing for a short period of time, and no call had been made to notify Union Pacific about the semi prior to the collision.
Due to damage to the Union Pacific railroad crossing arm and electrical system, the crossing at Breslauer Way will be closed for several days. At this time traffic will not be able to cross Breslauer Way from Highway 273, and Eastside Road. Motorist are encouraged to use Wyndham Lane and South Bonnyview Road to access Breslauer Way, the police department said.

The collision occurred at about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday on a track owned by Union Pacific Railroad, and involved an Amtrak train on the Capitol Corridor service heading northeast from San Jose to Sacramento, according to Kelly Just, an Amtrak spokesperson.
Train 524 on the Capitol Corridor struck a vehicle that was obstructing the track, and that vehicle in turn struck a second vehicle, she said Friday. It was not immediately clear which vehicle Simi was in at the time of the collision.
Several other people were hospitalized after the crash with injuries ranging from major to moderate, CBS affiliate KOVR-TV of Sacramento reported.
No injuries were reported among the train crew or the estimated 120 passengers, according to Just.
The wreck occurred at East Tabor Road and Railroad Avenue, and caused closures of both roads that lasted several hours, police said in a news release. The Amtrak train was delayed by nearly three hours, Just said.
YOUNTVILLE — When the first Rock the Ride fundraiser to end gun violence was held last summer, the Napa Valley community was still reeling fro…
Simi rose to local prominence in the Napa Valley in the wake of Donald Trump’s 2016 election as president, which led her and three others to form Rise Up Napa in response to what they described as a rising threat of racism and intolerance.
“We have a president who doesn’t represent our beliefs,” she told the Napa Valley Register during a December 2016 march Rise Up Napa organized in downtown Napa against the then president-elect. “I realized complacency is no longer an option. We have to get off our couches and out of our houses and organize to stand up for what we believe. This is not politics as usual.”
Simi also was a member of the Napa chapters of the anti-gun-violence group Moms Demand Action, Indivisible and the Rock the Congress political action committee, according to Ermilita Bruce Gulliksen, a friend, neighbor and fellow Rise Up Napa co-founder.
A pair of attacks that killed Napa County residents — the March 2018 Pathway Home shooting in Yountville and a mass shooting that November in Thousand Oaks in which the Napa native Alaina Housley and 12 others died — moved Simi to urge quicker action against “the onslaught of gun violence … in our community and in our country,” she said during the Rock the Ride benefit in 2019 to fundraise for groups battling gun violence.
Lilea Heine, a former neighbor of Simi’s in Browns Valley and the executive director of First 5 Napa Valley, recalled the support Simi lent her and others involved in Rise Up Napa and Moms Demand Action.
“She was so comforting, reminding me of our work to shape the world we want for our kids and for our community,” said Heine, who first came to know Simi when both were serving as volunteer escorts for Planned Parenthood clinic visitors. “She was a great comfort during our time (together).” (Heine is a member of the Napa Valley Register’s editorial board.)
Later Thursday, Bruce Gulliksen reflected on the loss not only of a comrade-in-arms in political activism, but also of a neighbor and loyal friend.
“She was so personable. She would just know you from the first time you met her; she’d find something you had and find something to connect with you,” she said of Simi. “She was just beaming positivity; she was always a great relationship kind of a person.
“I’m still in shock,” said Bruce Gulliksen. “Everyone who knows her is still in shock. She was gone too soon. She had so much life to live.”
Simi leaves behind her husband, daughter and son, along with her parents and two sisters, according to Bruce Gulliksen.

SOLANO COUNTY – A fiery crash involving a vehicle and an Amtrak train has left one person dead near Vacaville early Thursday afternoon.
The Vacaville Fire Protection District says they responded to the scene near California Pacific and Elmira roads just before 12:30 p.m.
Crews found a vehicle fully engulfed after the crash.
California Highway Patrol has since confirmed one person in the vehicle died; no one else was in the vehicle, officers say. The train crossing arms were down when the vehicle was hit.
Due to the crash, train traffic on the Capitol Corridor is delayed. Train 532 is holding in Fairfield-Vacaville, Capitol Corridor says, while Train 543 is being delayed from departing Sacramento.
Amtrak released a statement Thursday afternoon saying more than a hundred people were on board the train and they were investigating the incident with authorities.
On January 19, Amtrak train 541 was traveling from Sacramento to San Jose at approx. 12:40 when a vehicle obstructing the track came into contact with the train in Elmira, CA with 106 passengers onboard. Amtrak is working with local law enforcement to investigate the incident.
According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), trespassing along railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, and railroad crossing incidents are the second leading cause of rail-related deaths in America. These incidents can affect everyone involved—those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers. They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and crossings. Amtrak continues to work closely with Operation Lifesaver (OLI) to #STOPTrackTragedies by emphasizing the obvious dangers of being on railroad property or disregarding warnings at rail crossings.

Minivan Driver Suspected Of DUI In Collision With SMART Train
Police said the driver could not speak and was not alert. He was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription drugs.
SANTA ROSA, CA — The driver of a minivan who collided with a SMART train Wednesday in Santa Rosa is suspected of driving under the influence of prescription drugs, Santa Rosa police said.
The crash was reported at 11:04 a.m. Wednesday on the railroad tracks at West Steele Lane, adjacent to Coffey Lane.
""Initial reports indicated that after the crossing arms had lowered to stop traffic, the vehicle (a white minivan) drove through the arms and was struck by the oncoming SMART Train,"" Santa Rosa police Sgt. Josh Ludtke said. ""The train struck the rear driver’s-side of the vehicle as it crossed the tracks, spinning it around, and it came to rest on the northwest side of the intersection.""

The driver of the minivan, a 57-year-old Santa Rosa man, was the only person in the car and was conscious when officers got there but he could not speak and was not alert, Ludtke said.
Personnel with the Santa Rosa Fire Department responded alongside an AMR ambulance crew. Once firefighter-paramedics extricated the driver, who was trapped in the minivan, he was taken to a hospital, fire officials said.

The driver did not suffer major injuries, according to police. He was contacted by SRPD accident investigators at the hospital, where he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription drugs, Ludtke said.
Police did not disclose the driver's name.
""It appeared the vehicle had been traveling south on Coffey Lane and it had turned west onto West Steele Lane just east of the tracks,"" Ludtke said. ""The vehicle likely drove into the opposing lane of traffic on West Steele Lane to go around the crossing arms and was struck by the train as it was clearing the intersection to continue west on West Steele Lane.""
No injuries were reported to anyone on the train, the Santa Rosa Fire Department said.
It was not clear how long the incident affected train service. A spokesperson for SMART could not immediately be reached by email Wednesday afternoon.

A motorcyclist was killed in a collision with a SMART train Wednesday in Santa Rosa after he drove into the opposite lane of traffic onto the tracks and struck one of the rear cars of the train, authorities said.
A motorcyclist was killed in a collision with a southbound SMART train Wednesday afternoon at the Guerneville Road crossing in Santa Rosa after he drove into the opposite lane of traffic onto the tracks and struck one of the rear cars of the train, authorities said.
The collision was reported about 3:55 p.m. at the crossing just feet from the Santa Rosa North SMART station where the train was scheduled to stop. Fifteen passengers were on board, according to SMART. No injuries were reported, said Santa Rosa Police Sgt. Summer Gloeckner.
Investigators found the motorcyclist, whose name was withheld by officials Wednesday, was driving east on Guerneville Road when he saw backed up traffic at the rail crossing, Gloeckner said. Instead of stopping, the man weaved into the westbound lane and drove onto the tracks as the train was passing through the intersection, police said.
“We’re not sure what speed, but he was traveling at a high rate of speed,” Gloeckner said of the motorcyclist. The collision caused both the motorcycle and the undercarriage of the train to catch fire, Gloeckner said.
David Bailey, who was on the platform at the nearby Santa Rosa North station waiting for the train, said he saw “a huge fireball” burst up from the train after the collision.
“I felt the hit inside the train,” said passenger William Gilmore. “That fireball - we could feel the heat from inside.”
It was too early to determine why the motorcyclist entered the wrong lane of traffic to pass through the crossing, Gloeckner said. She added that it did not appear that the conductor knew immediately about the collision.
Passengers on the train and bystanders tried to pull the man off the burning motorcycle and some brought buckets of water to douse the blaze. Train personnel also brought out fire extinguishers to help. Gilmore said he took off his leather jacket to try and extinguish the flames, which had engulfed the motorcyclist’s legs.
“Everybody was doing their part, hoping something better would happen,” Bailey said. “Everybody came to try and help in a bad situation.”
The burning motorcycle exploded moments after the rider was pulled clear of the wreckage, Gilmore said. Firefighters arrived soon after and quickly put out the fire. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene, Gloeckner said.
Traffic was blocked in both directions on Guerneville Road from Coffey Lane to North Dutton Avenue for officials to investigate the crash.
The train came to a halt in front of the passenger platform and the charred motorcycle sat on its side several feet away, near the pedestrian path across the railroad tracks.
The crash dented the train body, and SMART officials were still trying to determine what other damage, if any, the collision may have caused, said Jennifer McGill, SMART’s public safety chief. The intersection’s safety equipment - the crossing arms and bells - was working at the time of the crash, she said.
“The train conductor couldn’t have stopped (the crash),” said Maaz Sheikh, who had been waiting for the train on the platform at the time of the collision and helped pull the rider off the burning motorcycle.
Elizabeth Wilcox, a resident at a nearby apartment complex, said a loud boom drew her to the train tracks, where she found the group of people attempting to pull the man from his downed motorcycle and put out the flames.
“It just makes my heart sink every time I hear about these (deaths),” Supervisor Shirlee Zane, a SMART board member, said upon hearing initially of the incident.
Multiple calls and messages to SMART General Manager Farhad Mansourian and Matt Stevens, SMART’s spokesman, went unanswered ?Wednesday.
The motorcyclist’s death marks the seventh fatality involving a SMART train this year, and 11th since the commuter rail agency launched service in August 2017. There have also been two train collisions - both in Santa Rosa - that led to injury, but none at the location near Guerneville Road.

The death of a man hit by a SMART train on Friday was the second this week and fourth in two weeks along the tracks.
A second pedestrian this week was struck and killed by a SMART train Friday afternoon in Santa Rosa, the fourth death on the passenger rail line in about two weeks.
Authorities think two men who died Wednesday and Friday intended to take their lives. Friday’s death was the eighth along the tracks since the rail service from San Rafael to Sonoma County airport started in August 2017. Three have been deemed accidents and five are suspected suicides.
The four deaths this year have all occurred in the past two weeks, two of them at the same rail crossing in Rohnert Park. The Rohnert Park crashes are believed to have been accidents.
By comparison, the Bay Area Rapid Transit commuter rail system, which carries 126 million passengers annually in four counties, has had five pedestrian collisions in 2019. Three people have died.
The unidentified man was hit shortly before 3 p.m. Friday by the southbound Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit train near the San Miguel Road track crossing. He was pronounced dead at the scene, the Santa Rosa Police Department said in a statement. Trains reach a top speed of 79 mph where the man was struck, rail agency officials said.
“It’s tragic,” Farhad Mansourian, SMART’s general manager, said in an interview Friday night. “Your heart stops for the train crew; it stops for the victim’s family, for the passengers, for everyone who is affected.”
Mansourian said the recent train deaths represent a much larger issue than train safety that requires an aggressive, collaborative response from the entire community of local government, public safety, mental health and media professionals.
“Suicide is a community issue,” he said, “and we need everybody’s help. SMART cannot solve the suicide and mental health issue.”
Nevertheless, Mansourian said the rail agency will consider taking whatever additional safety steps are necessary to prevent more deaths on the tracks, including slowing the trains at certain crossings and hiring more safety officers to monitor the rail line.
The man killed Friday was seen loitering near the tracks before the train came. Witnesses said rail crossing arms were down and the train blew its horn several times before the man was struck, police said. Based on video from the train, police think the man took his own life. The Sonoma County Coroner’s Office had not identified him Friday night, police said.
“SMART has become a ‘death train’ for those in the community that have come to the end of their rope,” said Felix Huerta, a union official of Operating Engineers Local Union 3, representing 28 local SMART employees in contract negotiations with the rail agency. “The cities, counties and the communities have to come up with a solution to homelessness, housing and the alienation of the have-nots for this to stop.”
Union representatives and SMART officials plan to meet Monday to discuss safety issues regarding the trains and rail line, Huerta said.
SMART Police Chief Jennifer McGill said each train-related death gets investigated to determine the unique circumstances. But she also said the suicidal acts point to a broader, community problem.
Mansourian said the rail agency’s board of directors will gather Wednesday to discuss the series of train fatalities and related issues. Earlier this week, SMART began installing sidewalk fencing dubbed a Z gate at 30 of its 62 road-level crossings. The deadly Golf Course Drive crossing in Rohnert Park, where two people were run over by trains on back-to-back mornings in late June, was the first place to get the safety enhancement.
Huerta, the union leader, has called for SMART to hire more safety enforcement officers to monitor activity along the 43-mile rail line since the entire job now is done by only one person.
Mansourian said Friday that “everything is on the table” regarding rail safety upgrades and public outreach to try to prevent suicide by train.
“SMART is committed to doing anything and everything the professionals say we should do to combat mental health issues and suicides, which is what we’re dealing with,” he said.
Meanwhile, passengers Friday were taken off the train about a quarter-mile south of the Santa Rosa crash site just before 4 p.m. and offered transportation by bus or van.
The crash disrupted SMART rail service for a little more than two hours. Service resumed at 5:19 p.m., said rail agency spokeswoman Jeanne Mariani-Belding. San Miguel Road was closed to vehicle traffic, but still accessible to pedestrians, between Santiago and Bock from about 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Nick Martinez, who was on the train at the time of the collision, said he didn’t know the train had hit a pedestrian until a SMART employee told him.
“The brakes slammed really hard. ... It just sounded like a bunch of stuff was falling,” he said. “One of the workers came and said there’s been a casualty.”
Cody Kay, who was also onboard, said the train hit an object less than five minutes after leaving the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport station, and came to a stop 30 seconds later.
“I could see debris on either side,” Kay said, noting he didn’t realize the object was a person until a SMART employee informed him.
David Rabbitt, chairman of the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors and a director on the SMART board, called Friday’s train fatality a tragedy the rail agency could not necessarily have prevented.
“Any death is one too many, but again, suicide is a societal issue that we’ve been struggling with at every level of government,” he said.
“We need to figure out better mental health systems and taking care of one another better.”
Kay had a message for anyone who might be considering taking his or her life on the train tracks.
“Someone loves you,” he said. “No matter who you are, someone loves you.”

SMART Train Board To Discuss Recent Spate Of Pedestrian Deaths
Following five recent pedestrian deaths, the board of directors plans to discuss public safety, operation and public outreach.
PETALUMA, CA — The Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit's Board of Directors is meeting in Petaluma Wednesday afternoon to discuss the recent spate of pedestrians who have been killed by its commuter trains. Five people have died between June 27 and Monday. Three of the deaths are considered suicides and two were labeled accidents.
Nine people have been killed by SMART trains since Jan. 13, 2018, and six of them are considered suicides. SMART started its train service between San Rafael and Santa Rosa in August 2017.
The Board of Directors at the 1:30 p.m. meeting at SMART offices in Petaluma will discuss an overview of the agency's public safety, operation and public outreach team's assessment related to the recent deaths in the Santa Rosa and Rohnert Park areas.

SMART General Manager Farhad Mansourian said in a report to the board that a task force evaluates all aspects to determine the circumstances that contributed to the collision. The inquiry includes a review of all federal and state safety standards, devices and warning systems.
""Though no amount of additional enhancements can fully account for human behavior or distractions, SMART continues to evaluate what enhancements or enforcement options can be made to improve the public awareness of the active railroad by the inattentive pedestrian, bicyclist or driver crossing the tracks,"" Mansourian said in his report.

After an Aug. 30, 2018 pedestrian death in Rohnert Park, Mansourian assembled a task force the next month to review all grade crossings with sidewalks or some other path-of-travel across the tracks.
The task force identified ways to improve public awareness of the trains at 30 of the 62 locations it reviewed. The improvements included ""Watch for Trains"" stencils on the sidewalk and pedestrian ""channelization"" that forced pedestrians to break their stride and change direction before
crossing the track.
The SMART board reviewed the suggestions at a workshop in October, and SMART included more features to increase awareness of the trains.
In May, SMART awarded a contract to Ghilotti Bros. Inc. for improvements that could quickly be made at 17 high priority crossings in Petaluma, Rohnert Park and Santa Rosa. The improvements included widening sidewalks, installing fencing and barrier railing and ""Z"" gate style
channelization to raise pedestrian awareness of the trains.
The SMART board Wednesday afternoon will consider approving an additional $249,175 to add path-of-travel enhancements at 13 locations in San Rafael, Novato, Cotati and Rohnert Park. The improvements are to be completed by Oct. 31.

A woman trying to outrun a SMART train was killed Thursday morning, at the same Rohnert Park intersection where a man died in August after he was struck walking across the tracks.
A Central Valley woman trying to outrun a SMART train was killed Thursday morning, at the same Rohnert Park intersection where a man died in August after he was struck walking across the tracks.
This is the fifth fatality on North Bay's passenger rail line since it started running in August 2017.
The woman, Jimmie Joy Qualls, 30, of La Grange, walked under the gate crossing arm on Golf Course Drive near Commerce Boulevard and then was hit by a northbound Sonoma-Marin Area Transit train about 8 a.m., Rohnert Park Public Safety Deputy Chief Aaron Johnson said.
“She was struck right there on the railroad track and died on impact at 7:51 a.m.,” he said. The investigation continues, but officials don't think her death was a suicide.
The train had pulled away from the Rohnert Park Station near the Rohnert Park Expressway and was about two miles north of the station when the crash happened. It was believed to be going between 65 mph and 70 mph when Qualls was struck, said Jennifer McGill, chief of police for SMART. Transit agency officials said they would review video footage to check the exact train speed at the time of the collision. Train speeds in that area top out at 79 mph.
“All protocols were followed in a situation like that by the engineer,” McGill said. “The gate arms were down, lights were flashing and horns were ringing alerting the pedestrian who blatantly went under the safety equipment. Nothing else from our end could have prevented this death.”
Despite law enforcement officials saying there were no eyewitnesses, Alphonse Tramutolo said he was waiting in his car at the Golf Course Drive train crossing when he saw Qualls wearing a peach-colored dress walk onto the tracks. Moments later, he saw her body flying through the air.
“I do not remember hearing or seeing the train stop anytime soon” after hitting her because the “it was going so fast, unusually fast,” said Tramutolo, who lives near the SMART tracks and drives daily through the Golf Course Drive crossing. “I was listening to music and then I heard the (train) horns, looked up and saw the impact.”
The train operator told authorities he first spotted Qualls after she ducked under the crossing arm at the Golf Course Drive intersection and she was only about 50 yards in front of the fast-moving train.
SMART officials said earlier this week the agency's code enforcement officers spoke to Qualls and warned her multiple times not to walk on the train tracks.
McGill said when code enforcement officers talked to her near Golf Course Drive they didn't know her name or whether she was one of the handful of people in the area living in homeless encampments alongside the train tracks.
Rohnert Park Public Safety Director Timothy Mattos said the city's police officers were unable to find Qualls after SMART officers relayed their concerns about her recent presence on and near the tracks.
“SMART contacted her this week about the dangers of being on the tracks,” Mattos said. “I believe she probably thought she could get across and had done it many times before, so it is an unfortunate incident.”
Despite the woman's apparent recklessness around the rail line, Rohnert Park Mayor Gina Belforte said when there is an accident in the city involving the commuter train local officials need to talk about whether additional safety measures should be implemented to try to prevent more fatalities.
Her main focus is examining whether steps like adding pedestrian arms or if train speeds should be slower at certain areas along the SMART line where pedestrians, motorists and bicyclists can cross the tracks.
“I understand SMART is trying to put together a fast commuter service but to an extent I think speed may have been an issue,” Belforte said.
McGill said that if the trains slowed at each of the 60 public track crossings it would take upwards of 10 hours to complete the 43-mile public transit rail line between Sonoma County airport in Santa Rosa and downtown San Rafael.
“We already have pedestrian arms installed at a few areas and we also follow train speed protocols as set forth by state and federal regulations,” McGill said. “In this instance, with this woman, she completely disregarded everything we put in place for safety.”
Of the four previous deaths involving SMART trains, the most recent occurred in November when a Rohnert Park man walking on the tracks was hit and killed by a southbond train in south Santa Rosa near the pedestrian train crossing at Hearn Avenue. In January 2018, a woman took her life by standing on the tracks near the same Hearn Avenue crossing and was struck by a southbound train.
The other two earlier fatalities both occurred in August 2018. One incident involved a 72-year-old woman who crawled on the tracks near the Hamilton Station in Novato and was killed by train. The other death happened at the same Golf Course Drive rail crossing, when a 29-year-old man wearing noise-isolating headphones was run over by the train walking across the tracks where Qualls died.
Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane, who also sits on the SMART board of directors, called Thursday's incident a horrible tragedy that will be thoroughly investigated and reaffirmed safety is the top priority of the transit agency's board.
“After two deaths at this same crossing, we are obviously going to ask ourselves if there is more we could do there to make it safe,” Zane said. “But ultimately you can't stop someone from making bad decisions.”

On Friday morning, a westbound cyclist unwittingly rode into the path of a SMART train and died.
When a SMART train approaches Golf Course Drive in Rohnert Park - the site of three fatal accidents in less than a year - red warning lights flash, bells ring and three gate crossing arms swing across the traffic lanes.
The counterweights on the crossing arms extend part way across the adjacent sidewalks, creating a small obstacle for pedestrians and cyclists approaching the tracks.
Unless they're heading west on the south side of the road, or heading east on the north side. There are no crossing arms, no counterweights, no obstacles that might attract the attention of someone absent-mindedly approaching the railroad track.
On Friday morning, a westbound cyclist unwittingly rode into the path of a SMART train and died.
Authorities said the man was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, his head was down and, like so many pedestrians and cyclists, he was wearing headphones. He eventually saw the train, and the engineer saw him, but it was too late.
This was, by all appearances, a tragic accident. Witnesses said a woman struck at the same crossing a day earlier had gone around a crossing arm, evidently trying to cross the tracks before the train arrived.
SMART can't stop people from risking their lives.
But the North Bay commuter rail system must do better than asserting that it is complying with all applicable federal regulations - the initial response to last week's fatalities from SMART police Chief Jennifer McGill.
SMART General Manager Farhad Mansourian did better Saturday when he visited the Golf Course Drive crossing and promised an investigation of safety measures as well as pedestrian and cyclist behavior to try to avoid accidental deaths.
“We will figure out what else can be done, what else should be done,” he said, adding that “there is nothing more critical to SMART than safety.”
The safety assessment shouldn't stop at Golf Course Drive. There are 63 at-grade crossings along SMART's 43-mile route, and there will be more as service extends to Larkspur later this year and Windsor in 2021. All of them should be reviewed for possible safety improvements.
Some crossings have two arms to stop auto traffic. Many have three, and a few, including West Ninth Street in Santa Rosa, have four. More crossing arms mean more counterweights that partially block sidewalks. Crossing gates can be installed for sidewalks, or gates can be located so they block sidewalks and bike lanes as well as traffic lanes, according to a Federal Railroad Administration report on pedestrian safety.
Crossing gates aren't the only solution. Some rail systems place flashing lights and warning signs on sidewalks. SMART painted warnings on the sidewalks approaching the Golf Course Drive crossing after a young man, also wearing headphones and looking down, walked in front of a train and was killed last August. That wasn't enough.
Pedestrians and cyclists need to be alert near trains, but people blunder. That isn't a capital offense. Here in California, the Public Utilities Commission developed “z-gates,” fenced zigzag pathways that force pedestrians and cyclists to look in the direction of approaching trains before they reach the tracks.
We think SMART should take a close look at z-gates for deployment at busy at-grade crossings. Golf Course Drive would be a good place to start.

SMART Train Collision: Driver Of Truck Failed To Stop, CHP Says
UPDATED: ""The crossing arms were down and the warning lights activated,"" CHP said about the collision between a SMART train and a box truck.
SONOMA COUNTY, CA — UPDATED: A local man is expected to survive the injuries he suffered Thursday in a collision with a SMART train in south Santa Rosa, the California Highway Patrol says. At about 3:20 p.m., 68-year-old Detlev Ihfled of Santa Rosa was driving a commercial box (delivery) truck westbound on Todd Road near Moorland Avenue and failed to stop at the tracks as a northbound Smart Train was approaching at an undetermined speed, said CHP Spokesman Jonathan Sloat.
""The crossing arms were down and the warning lights activated,"" Sloat said. ""For unknown reasons, Ihfled failed to stop and ran through the crossing arms. The cab of the truck crossed the tracks, but the train struck the rear box bed.""
The impact caused the truck to spin and flip before shearing off a utility pole, Sloat said.

The collision sent debris catapulting into an adjacent parking lot and down the tracks, Sloat said.
The train came to a stop approximately a quarter of a mile north of the crossing, according to CHP.

Although there was significant damage to the front of the SMART train, none of the 47 passengers reported suffering injuries in the crash nor did three crew members, according to CHP.
Ihfled was taken to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital with major injuries that were not believed to be life threatening, Sloat said.
Friday afternoon, Ihfled was in fair condition, a Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital spokeswoman said.
Thursday's collision delayed trains by at least 20 minutes, SMART said on social media.
SMART spokeswoman Jeanne Mariani-Belding said a bus bridge took train passengers from the downtown Santa Rosa station south to Rohnert Park to bypass the collision site.
One-way traffic control was in effect for several hours on westbound Todd as the debris was removed.
The investigation is ongoing.
""[The] driver does not remember anything,"" Sloat told Patch Friday morning.
Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to call CHP at 707-588-1400.

Security footage that captured a SMART train and truck crash last week just south of Santa Rosa shows the crossing arms lower before the truck drives over the tracks.
Surveillance video from a business in southwest Santa Rosa shows the moment last Thursday when a box truck barreled through lowered crossing arms into the path of an oncoming SMART train, which smashes into the rear of the truck, spreading debris along hundreds of yards of rail track.
It is the first real-time footage of a violent crash that badly injured the furniture truck driver, Detlev Ihlenfeld, 68, and stunned many of the more than four dozen passengers and crew members aboard. Some passengers were lifted out of their seats by the collision, on the tracks parallel to Moorland Avenue at its intersection with Todd Road.
The video, shot from a security camera on a Ghilotti Construction Co. building at
238 Todd Road, was posted online Sunday to the image-sharing website gfycat.com. By Tuesday, it had garnered nearly 300,000 views.
“I thought it was an earthquake,” said Mark Teal, Ghilotti's information technology support specialist.
The whole building shook from the crash, Teal said. A co-worker shouted it was a train crash, so several Ghilotti employees ran outside in the immediate aftermath, where they came across piles of debris and
Ihlenfeld, who was aided by bystanders before EMT workers arrived.
Teal went back inside to check the security camera. “I wanted to see what happened,” he said.
About 10 to 15 minutes after the crash, he had the footage uploaded to a USB drive and handed it to the CHP.
Teal said he didn't share the video online.
It appeared the footage posted online was the same video Teal turned in to the CHP. However, a monitor was visible on the online video.
Ihlenfeld was taken to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, authorities said. He told CHP investigators last week he had no memory of the crash.
None of the 47 passengers or three crew members aboard the train were injured in the crash, according to the CHP.
Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit Police Chief Jennifer Welch said information about the engineer would not be released, and referred questions about the train's speed to the CHP.
CHP Officer Jon Sloat said the agency doesn't have the expertise to accurately determine train speed. Last week he initially estimated the train was traveling at least 50 mph, but after viewing the video he said it “could be faster than that.”
“I have viewed the video circulating and it clearly depicts the grade crossing warning devices functioning with gate arms fully horizontal,” Welch said. “From this video it does not appear the truck driver had any regard for the warning devices or made any attempt to stop.”
Ihlenfeld could not be reached for comment.
The heavily damaged lead train car is still being assessed for repair costs, Welch said.

Authorities say at around 4:39 p.m. Wednesday, dispatchers with the Union Pacific Railroad contacted the Red Bluff Police Department to report that one of their trains had been involved in a collision with a vehicle in the area of Main Street and Walton Avenue.
Officers responded to the scene and located a unoccupied pickup truck that had major damage sitting next to the railroad tracks.
During their investigation, it was determined by authorities that a Union Pacific train was traveling northbound in the area, sounding its horn when the train encountered a Ford F-150 pickup truck attempting to drive westbound on Walton Avenue.
Authorities say that the train conductor continued to sound the train's horn but the vehicle failed to get off the tracks, which resulted in the train crashing into the pickup truck.
The driver of the pickup truck, identified as 51-year-old Brandon Funk of Red Bluff, immediately left the scene of the accident.
The Red Bluff Police Department says that Corporal Lampron, his partner K-9 Max, and other officers began searching the area where Funk had last been seen.
Authorities say that K-9 Max alerted to Funk's location around 300 yards away from the scene of the collision. The Red Bluff Police Department says that K-9 Max was able to deter a violent confrontation and Funk was taken into custody without the use of force.
As the investigation progressed, officers determined that Funk was the driver of the pickup truck and that no passengers were inside of the vehicle at the time of the collision.
Funk was evaluated at the scene for driving under the influence and was subsequently arrested for DUI.

Her family described her as a vibrant young woman full of potential, whose absence has left a significant void in their lives.
""She was our whole world,"" said Melinda Freemyers, Olivia's grandmother. ""I was there when Livy was born, and I was the second person to hold Livy.""
Melinda and Luke Freemyers, Olivia's grandparents, adopted her when she was 3 years old after her mother, their daughter, passed away from cancer.
""Our family got together and we thought that’s the best place for Livy, and so we adopted Livy, and it’s one of the best things we ever did,"" they said.
Olivia's older sister, Rosanna Baker, said Olivia was a role model to her nephews and nieces.
""I have another son who plays football for the Spartans in Red Bluff, and she was always there,"" Baker remembered. ""Always there rooting him on. Yelling his name. The loudest one there, you can hear her for miles.""
Rosanna's son, Joseph, remembered Olivia as one of the kindest people he had ever met, recalling their last trip to the movies.
""She started being really loud, loving the movie and all that,"" he said, smiling. ""She made everybody in the theater laugh and we were so loud in there. And she made everybody have fun, wherever we brought her she made sure we had fun.""
Olivia graduated from high school at just 16 years old and had plans to attend cosmetology school.
""The prettiest eyes you ever saw,"" said Melinda. ""Even when she was just a little baby, everyone would say what beautiful eyes she had.""
With so much ahead of her, Olivia's family said they never imagined life without her.
""She was the best baby sister ever and I will always love her, and there is always going to be a hole in our family's heart.""

Authorities name woman killed by train
A woman killed after being struck by an Amtrak train in Ventura Dec. 26 has been identified.
Jaime Curran, 53, died from multiple, blunt-force injuries, according the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office. The manner of death was deemed undetermined.
Curran, described as homeless, was struck by the train just before 8 p.m. along the tracks near Auto Center and Hofer drives, according to the Ventura Police Department. The tracks are sandwiched between southbound Highway 101 and the Ventura Auto Center.
The woman was pronounced dead at the scene, police officials said at the time.
No passengers or crew members were injured in the collision, but the train, headed south from San Luis Obispo, was halted for more than two hours, an Amtrak spokesperson said previously.
Battery charger suspected in start of Oxnard fire
Firefighters battled a commercial building fire in Oxnard Sunday night, stopping it from spreading to surrounding businesses, authorities said.
The Oxnard Fire Department received a call just after 8:30 p.m. of signs of smoke at a single-story building near Richmond and Mountain View avenues, said Battalion Chief John Ceceña. The industrial area lies between East Fifth Street and East Wooley Road in the Five Points Northeast neighborhood.
Crews at the scene reported light smoke followed by flames venting through the roof of the building housing multiple businesses like an auto shop and a woodworking shop. Firefighters cut through the roll up doors and were able to contain the fire to the structure, Ceceña said.
Firefighters kept the blaze from spreading to neighboring businesses with help from the Ventura County Fire Department, he said.
No occupants were in the building at the time and no damage was reported to surrounding buildings or vehicles. The building was deemed non-operable until the city's building and safety department determines the building is safe to reenter, the battalion chief said.
The Oxnard Fire Department is investigating the fire, but a lithium ion battery charger was suspected as the fire's source.
On Monday, firefighters responded to a fire in a battery pack at a Moorpark drone company. Smoke from the fire forced the occupants to evacuate Monday morning.

A pedestrian was fatally struck by an Amtrak train north of Ventura late Friday morning, authorities said.
The incident was reported shortly after 11:20 a.m. near Solimar Beach, said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Greg Gibson. Tracks in the area are situated between old Pacific Coast Highway and Highway 101 on a seaside stretch between Ventura and the Mussel Shoals area.
Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner train No. 765 had been traveling northbound, from Irvine toward Goleta, when the pedestrian, described as a trespasser, was hit, a spokesperson for the rail agency said. There were no injuries among the 64 crew members and passengers aboard.
The incident remained under investigation Friday by sheriff's officials and railroad authorities.
The pedestrian, a woman, was pronounced dead at the scene, Gibson said.
On Tuesday, the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office identified her as a 33-year-old resident of Morro Bay. The manner of death was found to be suicide.
A week earlier, on Jan. 19, a pedestrian was killed by an Amtrak train in Oxnard.

A man died after being struck by an Amtrak train in Oxnard Friday afternoon, authorities said.
The Oxnard Police Department responded to calls of a train versus pedestrian near Gonzales Road and Oxnard Boulevard shortly before 1 p.m., said Cmdr. Ricardo Vazquez.
The department said Saturday the pedestrian was a 64-year-old man. He died at the scene.
No roads were affected by the collision, Vazquez said.
The tracks between Oxnard and Ventura were closed as a result of the incident, the regional train service Metrolink said on social media.
The affected train was Amtrak's No. 769 Pacific Surfliner, which runs between San Diego and Goleta. The train had been headed northbound.
Amtrak officials said 102 passengers and crew were aboard the train when the collision happened. No one was injured.
The train service is working with local police to investigate the crash but officials did say the man was trespassing on the tracks when it happened.
Oxnard Fire Department Battalion Chief Aaron Baker said the pedestrian was not at a marked railroad crossing. Rather, he was on a stretch of tracks between Gonzales Road and Citrus Grove Lane.
Investigators from Oxnard police, Union Pacific and Amtrak responded to the scene, Baker said.
Oxnard police officials said Saturday they didn't know why the man was on the tracks.
Late Monday afternoon, the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office reported the man's city of residence wasn't known. The manner of death was found to be suicide.

A 63-year-old woman died Tuesday after an Amtrak train struck her vehicle in Camarillo.
The incident was reported just after 10:35 a.m. at the railroad crossing near the intersection of Upland and Somis roads.
An Amtrak Surfliner headed northbound crashed into a four-door passenger vehicle with one female occupant, the Ventura County Fire Department said.
A woman was shot and injured at her home on Encino Avenue on New Year’s Eve by an ACS Security guard who was patrolling alone.
The vehicle had been traveling west on Upland Road when it stopped on the railroad tracks, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Tuesday.
The engineer saw the vehicle and applied the emergency brakes but was not able to stop the train.
The locomotive struck the vehicle, pushing it into the crossing arm control box, authorities said.
The woman was pulled from the vehicle in critical condition and flown by helicopter to a trauma center, where she later died. Her name has not been released.
Video posted to X, formerly Twitter, by the Fire Department showed the crumpled remains of the vehicle lying near the stopped train.
The collision did not cause the train to derail, and no injuries were reported on board. The crash remains under investigation.

Here's a roundup of recent incidents and announcements from Ventura County agencies:
Authorities release name in train fatality
Authorities have identified the woman killed when her car was hit by an Amtrak train in Camarillo Tuesday morning.
Carole Schlesinger was 63, according to the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office. Officials described her as transient. The manner of death was determined to be accidental.
Schlesinger had been driving a white sedan westbound on Upland Road around 10:35 a.m. She reportedly stopped on the railroad tracks as she entered city limits near the intersection with Lewis Road, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, which is contracted for police services in Camarillo.
Amtrak's Surfliner 765 was traveling northbound. The engineer saw the car and applied emergency braking, authorities said, but the train struck the car.
Firefighters extricated Schlesinger from the wreckage. She was flown from the scene by helicopter to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, where she was later pronounced dead.
No injuries were reported among the 207 passengers and crew members on the train, authorities said.
Witnesses have been asked to contact Senior Deputy Luke Riordan at 805-388-5100.
Victim of hit-and-run ID'd
Authorities have released the name of a woman killed in a hit-and-run incident in Thousand Oaks early Sunday.
Sheila Pluntke was 84, according to the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office.
Pluntke was struck around 12:05 a.m. Sunday in the parking lot of an apartment building in the 2000 block of Los Feliz Drive, the sheriff's office reported. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
Phone scam suspect arrested
Authorities on Wednesday arrested a Calabasas man, 30, suspected of using a phone scam to take nearly $200,000 from an elderly Thousand Oaks resident.
The arrest, made during a warrant search in Calabasas, followed an extensive investigation launched in October, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Office. The agency is contracted for police services in Thousand Oaks.
Officials believe additional suspects were involved. The investigation is ongoing.
Calls to the 81-year-old man were made over several days leading up to Sept. 28, when the victim met suspects for a handoff of money in the 2400 block of Thousand Oaks Boulevard, said Detective Kevin Walters. The victim's loss was close to $200,000, he said.
Such scams can involve large networks, Walters said, with scammers claiming to be from a trusted company or government organization. Callers may convince victims they're part of a criminal investigation and must pay bail over the phone, for example.
In the Thousand Oaks case, a caller initially pretended to be an Amazon employee calling about a possible fraudulent purchase in the victim's name.
Over the next few days, the bogus case was ""sent up the chain"" to people impersonating federal authorities from agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and Drug Enforcement Administration, Walters said.
Sheriff's investigators learned the identities of some of the alleged scammers and have connected the suspects to a similar out-of-state case.
Wednesday's search at the Calabasas home reportedly turned up additional evidence. Sheriff's detectives are ""actively pursuing"" other suspects, Walters said.
As of Thursday, authorities hadn't recovered the victim's money, he said, but they're working on it.
The suspect was arrested on suspicion of three felonies: theft by false pretenses, conspiracy and theft from an elder or dependent adult. He remained at the county's main jail Thursday with bail set at $200,000 and is scheduled for arraignment Friday afternoon.
Sheriff's officials reminded residents law enforcement agencies won't ask citizens to pay for bills, fines, bail or warrants over the phone. If you've been the victim of a scam, you can make a report by calling the sheriff's non-emergency dispatch line at 805-654-9511.

Editor's note: Our live coverage has ended. You can find a summary of the incident here, and a story on expected track repairs as of Thursday here.
Original story:
Several cars of an Amtrak Coast Starlight train derailed after a collision with a county vehicle in Moorpark late Wednesday morning, authorities said.
The train hit a Ventura County Public Works Agency water truck that was being driven by a public works employee, officials said.
A center was set up for family members to reunite with passengers, at the adult center at 799 Moorpark Ave. As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, most people at the center had been picked up by family or had boarded buses to Union Station in Los Angeles.
Here are the latest updates:
Additional passenger sent to hospital
As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, authorities added one more person to the number taken to local hospitals after someone at the Moorpark center, where passengers had been bused, was transported. In all, 16 people were taken to hospitals, including the truck driver taken to a trauma center.
Authorities also had conflicting numbers of passengers on the derailed Amtrak train.
Olivia Irvin, senior public relations manager for Amtrak, said that based on ticket scans, the train was carrying 198 passengers.
Ventura County Fire Engineer Andy VanSciver said based on the count of people getting off the train, there were 186 passengers.
Both agreed there were also 13 crew members aboard.
It wasn't clear exactly what caused smoke, initially described as fire, under the luggage car, VanSciver said late Wednesday afternoon.
Something was putting up smoke, he said. Firefighters put water on it, and the smoke went away. Whether it was heat or full combustion wasn't known, he said.
Birthday trip
Mindy Faver of Detroit and her mother Sheri Peterson, who lives in Oceanside, waited outside the center before 4 p.m. for a local friend to pick them up.
Wednesday was Peterson’s birthday, and the duo were on a special mother-daughter trip to visit family in Eugene, Oregon.
“All of a sudden: Smack!” Faver recalled. She was seated facing the rear of the train and saw what she later found out was the water truck’s tank tumbling past her window.
But with the minimal injuries, she said, “It could have been a lot worse.”
Patty Wells of Killeen, Texas, also waited outside the Moorpark center, determined to get rolling again as soon as she was able toward Seattle. Amtrak representatives had told her they planned to bus passengers back to Union Station in Los Angeles, then transport them north by way of the Central Valley.
Wells had already been on the train from Killeen to Los Angeles since Monday before hopping on the coastal line Wednesday morning.
“I’m still gonna visit my daughter,” she said.
Traffic remains slow
4 p.m.: Traffic along Highway 118, also called Los Angeles Avenue, remained slow in both directions near the accident site, especially in eastbound lanes heading into Moorpark, traffic maps showed.
Earlier in the afternoon, the route was at a crawl as drivers tried to catch a glimpse of the scene between fields of weeds and trees.
The railroad tracks run parallel to Highway 118, about 250 yards from the roadway. Around 1:30 p.m., the dirt road that crosses the tracks and runs perpendicular to the highway had been swarming with law enforcement officers, county officials and members of the media.
Signage at site
The spot along the Union Pacific Railroad tracks where the Amtrak train hit a county truck has advisory signs and a stop sign, said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Dean Worthy, but no electronic crossing arms. Worthy described the site as a remote farm road.
Ventura County fire officials said a fire that broke out after the derailment was under the baggage car. No details were immediately available as to what materials caught fire, but the blaze had been put out before noon.
An official with the county Office of Emergency Services said some hydraulic fluid had apparently spilled and may have been producing a lot of smoke after the derailment.
Passengers recount jolt
Kimberly Mathews, of Klamath Falls, Oregon, was taking the coastal route home when the train’s sudden jolt threw her across the seat.She stood up to go to the bathroom, she said, and was on the stairs when her car derailed, knocking her down again, Mathews recalled after arriving at Moorpark's community center, where train passengers were bused after the collision.
Mathews was suffering back and shoulder pain. “It feels like somebody took a sledgehammer and just whacked me 50 times,” she said.
Paramedics had told her to consider going to the hospital, but with no apparent route back to Klamath Falls, she decided against it. She’ll visit her doctor at home whenever she gets there, she said.
Tucson resident James Hinz, who was in the same car with Mathews, said the incident took 30 to 45 seconds from impact to derailment.
“I thought we were goners,” said Theresa Darragh, also from Tucson, who was traveling with Hinz.The train car then caught fire and its occupants evacuated, said Hinz and Darragh, who were were on their way to Seattle planning to catch a cruise ship for Alaska.As of midafternoon, the pair hadn’t yet heard about travel arrangements from Amtrak. They also hadn’t tracked down their luggage, which they’d checked into their car's luggage compartment before it caught fire.
By 4 p.m., Amtrak had arranged a bus back to Union Station in Los Angeles and told the partners they’d get them to Seattle by Friday, a day ahead of their cruise ship's departure.Hinz, on his first vacation after decades of work as a general contractor, said he wasn’t about to miss it.Darragh simply said she hopes the boat doesn’t get a hole in it.
Update on driver
3 p.m.: County officials said the person who suffered the most serious injuries, the driver of the Ventura County Public Works truck that was hit by the train, had been taken to the trauma center at Los Robles Regional Medical Center.
He was said to have serious injuries, but was described as being in stable condition.
First passengers arrive at meeting site
2:15 p.m.: Busloads of Amtrak passengers, along with their luggage, started arriving at the reunification center in Moorpark.
At least five buses, including from Simi Valley Transit, Moorpark City Transit and the Ventura County Transportation Commission, were ferrying passengers from the crash site, said Brian Chong, Moorpark's spokesperson.
Updated patient count
2:15 p.m.: Ventura County Fire officials said during an afternoon press conference that 15 people in all had been transported to local hospitals. One of them was taken to a trauma center.
Fourteen of the patients were classified as having minor injuries, while one had suffered critical injuries, according to radio traffic. Authorities said earlier the driver of the water truck that had been struck by the train was taken to a trauma center.
Fire officials also provided an update on Train 14's components, bassed on information from Amtrak. The train had two locomotives, two coaches, three sleeper cars, a dinner car, a lounge car and a baggage car.
Buses taking passengers to reunification site
The Ventura County Transportation Commission has sent two buses to the site to pick up passengers.
The buses will take passengers to the Moorpark Adult Active Center, 799 Moorpark Ave., said Darrin Peschka, agency spokesperson.
Traffic was open on Highway 118, also called Los Angeles Avenue, though was moving slowly. Authorities were stopping traffic periodically to let vehicles out of the incident staging area and to let people cross the roadway.
Train was headed to Seattle
1:45 p.m.: Amtrak officials said in an email that train 14 had been headed from Los Angeles to Seattle when the collision occurred around 11:15 a.m.
The water truck had been ""obstructing tracks"" in Moorpark when it was hit, the rail agency said.
Amtrak's tally of people on the train was higher than an earlier number from county officials. About 198 passengers and 13 crew members were on board, Amtrak said. All were evacuated without serious injuries.
Ventura County Fire Department officials later tweeted a different number: 186 passengers and 13 crew members.
""The train derailed as a result of the impact but remained upright,"" the statement from Amtrak spokesperson Kimberly Woods said. ""Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements. Amtrak, in coordination with local authorities, is conducting a full investigation.""
1 taken to trauma center
1:30 p.m.: Amtrak's train 14 had been headed northbound when it ran into a Ventura County water truck on the level grade crossing, authorities said during a press briefing.
The number of people on the train, tallied at 190, included Amtrak employees and passengers. Only minor injuries were reported.
One person driving the water truck was also injured. That person was transported to a local trauma center. No update was available on the status of the driver's injuries, but because of the nature of the accident, the person had to be taken to a trauma center, according to Ventura County Fire Department officials.
190 passengers on train
Ventura County Fire officials said all 190 passengers aboard the Amtrak Coast Starlight's train 14 appeared mostly uninjured. One person had been transported to a local hospital by ambulance. Four passengers in all had been transported with bumps and scrapes that were considered minor injuries.

A Ventura County Fire Department official said the crash occurred around 11:20 a.m. on 11100 W. Block of Los Angeles Avenue, surrounded by several large farms.
The seven-car passenger train traveling from LA to Seattle with roughly 198 passengers and 13 crew onboard collided with an irrigation truck, causing the train to derail partially. Then, a fire broke out beneath one of the train cars, but it was quickly extinguished. As a result, the truck was also totaled. By that time, all passengers had been evacuated.
One passenger says that they were just cruising along, and all of a sudden, there was a big bang, and then the car started reeling up and down and then left and right, and it smelled like gasoline, and dust was flying. They braced against the seat. Another one says they went back and forth everywhere and hit the table.
Fourteen passengers were hospitalized after sustaining minor injuries. The truck driver, however, suffered severe injuries and was transported to a trauma center. Additionally, as a precaution, the train’s driver was taken to a hospital. It has not been revealed who the people involved in the accident are.
While Amtrak released a statement suggesting that the water truck obstructed the tracks at Moorpark, the police say otherwise. Upon investigation, it does not appear that the truck was stopped or stalled on the tracks when it crossed while driving over a private frontage road.

Train Accident Statistics
In 2016, train accidents resulted in the deaths of 893 individuals, which represents a 20% increase from the previous year’s total of 744. Additionally, hospital admissions for injuries that could have been fatal increased by 4%, or 5,780 individuals, between 2020 and 2021, with a 21% increase in fatalities at highway-rail grade crossings during the same period.
Roughly one-third of train accident victims eventually recover from their injuries, while it was estimated that train accidents caused 266 out of the 893 pedestrian fatalities in 2021. Over 3,216 commuters were injured in train accidents that year, and if these injuries were more severe, they could have been fatal.
In 2015, 66 individuals died due to grade crossing incidents involving automobiles and trains in the United States.

Sixteen people were hospitalized Wednesday after an Amtrak train struck a public works truck and slid off the tracks in the city of Moorpark, Calif.
The 10-car Amtrak Coast Starlight passenger train was traveling northbound, from Los Angeles towards Seattle, when it struck the truck around 11:15 a.m. PT, officials said.
The train was carrying a total of 186 passengers and 13 crew members, none whom required extrication to exit the train, according to the Ventura County Fire Department's Public Information Officer. Amtrak put the passenger count higher, at 198. The truck's driver, a public works employee, was taken to a trauma center.
Statements from several local agencies characterized the passenger injuries as mostly minor, though some told reporters it was a scary and painful incident.
""I thought we were goners,"" passenger Theresa Darragh told the Ventura County Star.
Kimberly Mathews, who was traveling in the same car as Darragh, described to the outlet how she'd been left with shoulder and back pain after hitting the stairs during the crash.
""It feels like somebody took a sledgehammer and just whacked me 50 times,"" she said.
The crash's impact caused three of the train's seven passenger cars to derail, but they stayed upright. Smoke poured out from the train's luggage car, but the fire was extinguished quickly, the fire department said.
Amtrak did not immediately return NPR's request for more information.
The impacted vehicle, a Ventura County Public Works tanker truck, was atop a level-grade crossing as its employees were cleaning out a channel nearby, the The Star reported.
Ventura County Sherriff's Capt. Dean Worthy described the site to the outlet as ""a remote farm road."" The crossing has a stop sign, but no electronic crossing arms, photos show.

The Ventura County Fire Department and CHP have responded to the scene.
AIR7HD captured the train that officials say has had all eight train cars derailed at some level.
The train was traveling westbound and filled with passengers at the time at the crash.
There were more than 200 people on the train when it crashed. Officials were checking the passengers and helping them travel from the scene.

(KABC) -- Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday evening after an Amtrak train derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.
Officials said a total of 16 people were injured, including the driver of the water truck, but there were no serious injuries. If train cars had actually toppled over completely, officials believe there would have been a lot more people injured.
""We're very lucky today that the trains stayed on the wheels,"" said Andy Vansciver of Ventura County Fire. ""Obviously, it was derailed but it stayed vertical. I think that really limited the amount of injuries we had.""
AIR7 HD was above the scene and captured the train with several of its cars off the tracks.
People could also be seen on ambulance stretchers. One couple was headed to the hospital after one of them suffered an arm injury.
The train was traveling westbound and filled with more than 200 people at the time at the crash. Some of the passengers spoke with Eyewitness News about the ordeal.
""Yeah, I was listening to an audio tape when and I was laying back on the sofa, and all of a sudden, we hit very hard and things were flying around,"" said Debbie Welsford of Anaheim. ""Our luggage, my cup, the water ... everything was just flying around the room and we realized we hit something so we came out and looked and saw the water tank.""
""It was very brief. Felt the train make impact and, you know, flew me forward in the car,"" said Matthew Roberts of Paso Robles. ""Immediately got up to see if everyone around me was ok. The car filled with a lot of dust and it took about 30 seconds for the train to come to a stop and we assessed the situation, made sure everyone was ok, and got to the exit and that was it.""
The water truck was delivering water to local ranches in the rural area when it got in the way of the train. The driver was talking with police before being taken to the hospital. It's unclear why the water truck was in the train's way.
Officials were bussing the uninjured passengers to the Moorpark Senior Center where they could be reunited with loved ones. Amtrak worked with passengers to help them get to their final destination.
The train was set to stop in Oxnard on its way to Seattle.
The tracks themselves have been damaged due to the collision as well and it was unclear how people who use the line to and from work would be able to travel home Wednesday night.

Crews responded to a non-injury crash Sunday night after a train struck a vehicle on the tracks in Ventura, police said.
The incident was reported at 7:40 p.m along the train tracks near South Garden Street and the Ventura County Fairgrounds, authorities said.
According to Ventura Fire Department, a small compact car with two occupants was driving down South Garden Street under the freeway bridge. The driver turned onto the tracks thinking it was the road, police said.
When the occupants realized they were on tracks, they exited the vehicle minutes before an Amtrak passenger train traveling southbound struck the vehicle, authorities said.
The train was forced to stop but power was not shut down, leading authorities at the scene to declare the incident an electrical hazard. An Amtrak safety specialist instructed the conductor to back up, separating the train from the car. A tow truck then removed the car from the tracks, authorities said.
All train passengers and those in the surrounding area were evacuated to prevent any injuries caused by the hazard, authorities said.
Police said the driver of the car was arrested on suspicion of DUI. She was later booked into county jail.

- Share via
The Oxnard rail crossing that was the scene of Tuesday’s Metrolink derailment is the 23rd most hazardous in California, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration.
In 2014, two people were killed when their vehicle was struck by an Amtrak train at the Rice Avenue crossing.
According to data from the U.S. agency, the crossing had two collisions in 2010 and one in 2009.
The data indicate the Rice Avenue crossing had more collisions than any other Ventura County crossing in the 2009-2013 period.
LIVE UPDATES: Oxnard Metrolink crash
The issue of rail crossing safety has been raised before.
In 2009, The Times performed a data analysis showing so-called grade-level street crossings used by Metrolink trains such as the Rice Avenue junction had a particularly high number of accidents or near-collisions.
STORY SO FAR: Metrolink derailment
Twelve locations accounted for about one in five crossing accidents, and of all accidents, nearly one in four were along a 17-mile corridor in the San Fernando Valley. The most dangerous intersection was Sunland Boulevard at San Fernando Road in Los Angeles, at which there were 13 incidents. Buena Vista Street in Burbank, with nine, had the second-worst record.
Officials have talked about making some of these crossings safer, in some cases with extra barriers. But building more grade separations has been a slow process because such projects are expensive.
The Rice crossing was one of the places officials have talked about building a grade separation.

(KABC) -- A 54-year-old truck driver from Yuma, Arizona was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run after a Metrolink train headed toward Los Angeles struck his large pickup truck, which was hauling a trailer, on the tracks in Oxnard Tuesday. No fatalities were reported, Oxnard police said.
Ventura County Line Train 102 crashed at about 5:40 a.m. near 5th Street and Rice Avenue. The vehicle caught fire after the crash.
Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez managed to flee the scene, Oxnard fire officials said. An officer spotted Ramirez walking on Rice Avenue about 1.62 miles south of the accident and determined that he was the driver.
""It appeared that he was very distressed. The person appeared to be disoriented and on the phone,"" Oxnard Assistant Police Chief Jason Benites said.
Ramirez was not injured, but was taken to Ventura County Medical Center for observation. He was arrested following his release from the hospital. He has a valid driver's license, police said.
Benites said the 2005 Ford-450 pickup truck appeared to be traveling southbound on 5th Street, and in attempting to make a right turn onto a street, instead turned onto railroad tracks and got stuck. It was unclear if the area was part of his regular route.
PHOTOS: Metrolink commuter train derails in Oxnard
Before the crash, the train was leaving from the Oxnard station. With two miles of straight tracks, the driver of the train was able to spot the vehicle on the tracks early and pulled the brakes and provided warning signals. Authorities said the train had been going eastbound slower than 79 mph cruising speed.
Upon impact, five cars derailed, including three seen on their side and two upright, fire officials said.
""The whole truck was just up in flames, or car, I didn't know what it was. It was a fireball,"" Ted Maloney said. He immediately went inside the train car to help passengers. Maloney found a sweater and wrapped it around the neck of a female victim, who was bleeding.
""I just held her hand and comforted her and told her help was on the way,"" Maloney said.
A total of 49 people were on the train, including 46 passengers and three crew members. Authorities say 28 people were taken to area hospitals, with four in critical condition. One of the four in critical condition was the train engineer. The conductor and his assistant were treated and released.
""Patients have complained of dizziness, of headaches, of lower back pain, of pains related to being bumped, thrown, hit and so forth,"" said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer at Ventura County Medical Center.
FULL STORY: Dozens injured in Metrolink train collision transported to area hospitals
Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten credited crash safety technology to softening the blow of the collision. About two-thirds of the Metrolink fleet is 5 years old or less and is equipped with the technology.
""The front end of the cab car is designed to crumple by nature to help absorb the energy of that collision,"" Lustgarten said.
The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate the crash.
""[Federal Railroad Administration investigators] will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the factors that contributed to this accident. Safety must be every railroad's absolute top priority and we will establish what lapses, if any, occurred and order any necessary corrective actions,"" a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration said.
Experts will investigate if the crossing arms were working properly. They will also check the train's recorders. Authorities are optimistic the train had inward and outward facing cameras.
Approximately 24 freight trains and four passenger trains pass through the track near 5th Street and Rice Avenue per day, said Constance Gordon, a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission.
There have been 11 incidents on this specific crossing in the last 10 years, not including the incident which occurred Tuesday. The last incident occurred on June 3, 2014. Gordon said two people were killed.
The train tracks appeared to be heavily damaged following the crash Tuesday, which caused delays and cancellations for Metrolink and Amtrak trains. Amtrak train service between Los Angeles and Goleta was suspended for Tuesday.
Regularly scheduled Metrolink service continued between Union Station in Los Angeles and Moorpark. Buses were provided for passengers traveling beyond Moorpark, with stops at Camarillo, Oxnard and east Ventura.
Repairs could take several months, Lustgarten said.
For information related to passengers, Metrolink urged the public to call (877) 248-8381 or visit http://ht.ly/JAW5c.

OXNARD, Calif. - A Metrolink train derailed Tuesday morning after it collided with a tractor trailer on the tracks in Ventura County, injuring dozens, officials said.
The driver of the truck fled the scene when first responders arrived, but was arrested ""some miles down the road unharmed,"" officials said, adding the driver is currently in police custody. It is unclear if charges have been filed.
An investigator has told The Associated Press the accident occurred when the truck became stuck on the tracks as the driver turned before the crossing. The investigator says the driver is not from the area and made a premature right turn.
An official investigation is ongoing.
Sergio Martinez with the Ventura County Fire Department said there were a total of 51 involved in the accident, including the train's engineer and other railroad employees. Of those, 28 were transported to hospitals, with four in critical condition.
The VC Line 102 train, which was headed southbound to Los Angeles, hit the truck around 5:45 a.m. near 5th Avenue and Rice Street in Oxnard, according to the Ventura County Fire Department.
""For some reason there was a tractor trailer on the tracks there at Rice Avenue and Train 102 collided with it,"" Scott Johnson of Metrolink told CBS Los Angeles.
Martinez said the train was being pushed east by a read locomotive at its normal speed in that spot of about 79 miles per hour. Officials said the preliminary investigation indicates the driver saw the truck on the tracks ""from a great distance"" and attempted to apply the brakes.
All five of the train's cars are considered derailed, and three of them are lying on their side.
The truck caught fire and was left such a scorched and mangled wreckage officials were still not sure late Tuesday morning what type of truck it was.
Martinez said lots of Army equipment passes through the area, but he was not sure that the truck involved in the accident was with the military.

Keana Grey was heading to jury duty in Los Angeles before dawn Tuesday, sitting in the lower deck of the second Metrolink car from the front, when she felt the train shake.
UPDATE: Driver apparently drove truck on tracks before Metrolink crash, NTSB says
Looking out the window, the 19-year-old Oxnard woman thought she was dreaming: Just a few yards in front of her, the front train car was turning around.
------------
FOR THE RECORD, Feb. 24, 9:25 p.m.: An earlier version of this report incorrectly said the train’s conductor first saw the truck on the railroad tracks and pulled the emergency brake. It was the train’s engineer.
------------
“No, no, no,” she thought. “This can’t be happening.”
Around her, the lights went out, and she felt a sharp jostling. “We were knocked out of our seats about a foot or more, into the air,” Grey said.
The car fell onto its left side, and she heard groaning. She heard a man behind her ask, “Is everyone all right? Can everyone walk?”
He led her by the hand out of the car, even as workers from nearby pepper and strawberry fields rushed up to help other passengers.
Twenty-eight people were injured, four of them critically, but no one was killed when the five-car Metrolink commuter train — en route from Ventura County to downtown Los Angeles — struck a truck on the tracks in Oxnard and derailed.
The truck driver, whom police identified as Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Ariz., had driven his 2005 Ford F-450 about 80 feet west of the rail crossing, National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said late Tuesday. It’s unknown how long the truck, which was pulling a trailer, was on the tracks or if it had become stuck, Sumwalt said.
After the collision, the truck was pushed through the grade crossing, a total distance of about 300 feet, Sumwalt said.
Police said they found Sanchez-Ramirez about a mile and a half from the crash, and arrested him on suspicion of felony hit-and-run involving multiple injuries.
Sanchez-Ramirez’s wife, Lucila Sanchez, told The Times that he jumped out of the truck when he saw the train approaching and couldn’t restart his engine. “It’s not his fault,” she said.
The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals with broken bones, back and neck injuries, and head trauma.
The Metrolink train was moving at 79 mph near the 5th Street and Rice Avenue crossing about 5:40 a.m., authorities said, when the train conductor, who was in the first car, saw a truck stopped on the tracks. The conductor pulled the emergency brake but could not stop in time.
Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said it takes between a quarter-mile and a half-mile to stop a train with five cars. The train struck the truck and derailed, and four of its five cars went onto the gravel and street.
Lustgarten said the crash was recorded by cameras on board the train. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.
“We support the NTSB’s investigation, and this is theirs to look into,” Lustgarten said.
Nine of the patients injured in the derailment were rushed to Ventura County Medical Center, including the engineer. Bryan Wong, the hospital’s chief medical officer, said the engineer suffered injuries to the chest involving his lungs and heart and was conscious when he arrived.
“Really, the next 24 to 48 hours will give us the best sense of how he will recover from his injuries,” Wong said. “Certainly our hope is that his body rallies and his heart and lungs start to turn the corner.”
Police said the truck driver was taken to the hospital for observation, and was cooperating with the investigation. “He was very distressed,” said Oxnard police Assistant Chief Jason Benites.
Metrolink passenger Joel Bingham, 44, was heading to work in Chatsworth in the second car from the front. He was looking out the window when he saw the truck blow up.
“It was like the movies,” Bingham said. “It exploded when I went by.”
The Ventura man felt the train run off the rails. Then the lights went out and “everything started flying,” he said. He held onto a pole, and felt like a flag being whipped around. “It seemed like forever to come to a stop. It seemed like slow motion.”
Inside and outside the train, it was dark, and he could smell smoke and fire. “I just went into rescue mode,” Bingham said.
He said that about a dozen people were in his car. He said he told people to come to his voice, to escape through a safety window he had opened.
There were two women with broken arms, he said, and one with a broken shoulder.
Ted Maloney, 59, of Oxnard said he was driving to work near the crossing when he heard the Metrolink horn blaring.
“He just laid into the horn,” Maloney said. “I looked up and it was just a horrendous ball of fire.”
Maloney drove off the road and sat in his car for a few seconds, staring at the fire. He decided to help. As he ran toward two train cars flipped on their sides, he was met by two farm workers from a nearby strawberry field.
They helped Maloney, who has an artificial knee, climb into one of the trains.
Inside the train car, he saw a few passengers walking around in “a daze,” but most of them were sprawled on the floor. Purses, lunch sacks, laptops and boxes were strewn throughout the train car.
“Is anybody bleeding?” he screamed.
A passenger yelled back, “Yes, this lady’s bleeding.”
Maloney couldn’t find a first aid kit, so he grabbed a sweater, placed it under her head and held her hand.
“She called me an angel,” he said. “I said ‘No, I am just here to help you.’”
For the next 15 minutes, Maloney talked to the woman, who had been headed to work in downtown Los Angeles. He tried to keep her mind off her injuries. He said she seemed to have head, neck and back trauma.
He gathered her purse and slid it under her arm. He placed her laptop and other belongings next to her. Firefighters arrived and took over.
“It seemed like an eternity,” Maloney said.
Maloney has been in a bus wreck, traffic collision and plane crash.
“I can’t believe I even did what I did,” he said. “People needed help. I did what anybody else would do.”
The Metrolink train was equipped with new Rotem passenger cars designed to maximize passenger safety.
“The injuries came from people being tossed around,” said Keith Millhouse, a Metrolink board member. “The Rotem cars received very minor damage. They performed the way they should in terms of collision absorption. This could have been tremendously worse without them.”
The crossing, which is controlled by Union Pacific, has flashing lights, bells and arms that drop when the train is a quarter-mile away.
Two neighbors told The Times that the safety arms at the crossing don’t drop when a train is coming.
But Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said, “All indications are that, at the point of the incident, everything at the crossing including the gate arms and emergency notifications and bells were working properly.”

Withington was heading west on Poindexter Avenue. He turned onto a driveway that crossed the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks to access open land he was leasing on the north side of the tracks when the train arrived.
As the vehicle was crossing the tracks, the eastbound Amtrak train headed for San Diego struck the driver’s side of the vehicle, sending it into a nearby drainage ditch, said Ron Nelson, spokesperson for the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department.
The train was traveling about 50 miles per hour, said Sr. Dep. Ed Tumbleson for the Moorpark Police Department. The speed limit in the area is 70 miles per hour. The train’s horns were blaring, but the driver never stopped or slowed down, witnesses told police at the scene.x
Withington, who lived on Gabbert Road, frequently drove across the private crossing to get to the open lot, the deputy said.
Withington was president of Midway Drilling and Pump Company in Saticoy.
“He was a very hard-working and caring individual and would make sure that all jobs were done as best as they could for the customers,” said office manager Sandy Cornelius. Withington was a generous man who would give anybody the shirt off his back, she added.
The Moorpark resident was married to Willa Withington for 54 years. He had two daughters and one son, Harvey Withington, who will now maintain the company, Cornelius said.
The unprotected railroad tracks have been a longstanding problem, said Hugh Riley, assistant city manager for the city of Moorpark. “But the tracks are on private property, so the city doesn’t have any jurisdiction.”
“It’s very sad,” said Councilmember Keith Millhouse, who serves on a Metrolink committee.
Although he didn’t know the circumstances of the accident and what caused it, Millhouse wanted to remind people to be extra cautious around rail crossings.
“We don’t know what caused the collision but trains are deceptive in terms of the speed they move at,” Millhouse said.
“My thoughts and prayers go with the family,” he said. Officials will review the complete accident report in detail, he added, and determine if anything can be done to prevent a similar accident in the future.
There are several private uncontrolled crossings outside of town but only two within the city limits, Tumbleson said.
The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. No one on the train was injured, Nelson said in a press release.
