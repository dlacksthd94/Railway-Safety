The train hit the motorcyclist in the area of Springlake Drive and Hesperian Boulevard.

The crash happened around 1:55 p.m. ACFD said another person was injured from the collision.

No other details were immediately available. KRON4 reached out to the San Leandro Police Department for more information about this collision. We are waiting for a response.

A motorcycle rider who witnessed the collision told KRON4 that a woman on the back of a motorcycle was struck and killed by an Amtrak train. The witness said the victim was part of a group of about 100 bikers who had gathered in San Jose for an organized ride.

“I’m still in the process of processing everything,” said Brandon Lupinek. “It’s pretty gruesome what I saw. We were trying to get past the train tracks, an Amtrak train was coming. Unfortunately, a couple of people lifted the Amtrak arms that come down to block the roadway. Most of everyone got through. There was one person last, and he hesitated before going. The bike got clipped by the train and the rear-end, he was carrying a passenger. We witnessed her body flying through the air. Her leg was cut off and her body was in half from the waist down. That’s a motorcyclist’s worst fear for a passenger to get injured, let alone go down with them on our bikes.”

Feb. 23, 2025     SAN LEANDRO, Calif. - The motorcycle passenger who died after being struck by an Amtrak train when her driver rode over the train tracks after fellow riders lifted the railroad crossing arms in San Leandro has been identified.  The Alameda County Coroner's Office on Friday named the passenger as 25-year-old Julia Giovanna Rocca of Morgan Hill. 
 KTVU has reached out to multiple family members to learn more about Rocca, but they declined to comment.  Her brother said he was too angry and grief-stricken to speak.   San Leandro Lt. Abe Teng said that the investigation into what happened is still underway and that the motorcycle driver, who has not been formally identified, was still in the hospital this week.  Police have released some details so far about what happened on Sunday at 2 p.m. on Hesperian Boulevard near Springlake Drive, where there is a railroad crossing. Police said some people lifted the railroad crossing arm as an oncoming train was headed their way.  It is illegal in California and most other states to go around a railroad crossing.  There were about 100 people riding that day, though it doesn't appear as though it was part of some official event, police said.  The train struck the bike that Rocca was riding on – she was killed and her driver suffered critical injuries, police said.  The story has ignited on social media, with many questioning what would prompt anyone to lift a railroad crossing arm and why anyone would choose to try to beat a train.  Anyone with information should contact Traffic Unit Sergeant Ryan Gill at (510) 577-0446.

SAN LEANDRO, CA, (February 23, 2025) - Julia Giovanna Rocca was tragically killed on Feb. 23 when the motorcycle that she was a passenger on was struck by an Amtrak train in San Leandro.

Julia Giovanna Rocca was tragically killed on Feb. 23 when the motorcycle that she was a passenger on was struck by an Amtrak train in San Leandro.


The motorcycle was hit at about 2 p.m. at a railroad crossing on Hesperian Boulevard near Springlake Drive. According to police, fellow riders lifted the railroad crossing arms before the collision. It is illegal in California to go around a railroad crossing. 
The accident remains under investigation.MOTORCYCLE CRASH INVESTIGATION
Motorcyclists must be even more cautious with a passenger on board and authorities are trying to determine what caused the bike to crash, resulting in the passenger being injured.
Per the National Safety Council (NSC), approximately 6,000 motorcyclists are killed each year in the U.S. Candice Bond, an experienced motorcycle accident attorney, noted that in cases such as this, it is imperative to have an independent investigation into the crash conducted by a seasoned lawyer to protect a victim’s rights.
“Insurance companies often try to pressure victims to settle for a quick payout for far less than the case is worth,” Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal, added. “They are financially motivated to limit compensation and do not factor in the long-term consequences and suffering those victims will ultimately experience. Attorneys vigorously advocate for their clients to ensure that they are treated with respect and compensated fairly.”
WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM
The family members of Julia Giovanna Rocca may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of companionship, pain, suffering, and emotional distress following a tragic or catastrophic accident.
“The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand just what families are forced to go through, and protecting their rights is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help protect their legal rights and best interests.""

Authorities are investigating the death of a man who was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in northwest Berkeley on Tuesday morning.He was the second person to be killed in an Amtrak train fatality in Berkeley this month. The first incident took place Oct. 4 near the railway crossing with Harrison Street, according to media reports.On Tuesday, Amtrak said an individual who was trespassing on the track ""came into contact with the train"" around 9:15 a.m. near Gilman Street.As of publication time, he had been identified only as a man in his 40s. His name has not yet been released.

The train was traveling from Auburn, California, to San Jose, Amtrak said.""Amtrak is working with local law enforcement to investigate the incident. Train 529 resumed its journey shortly before noon,"" Amtrak said in a statement at 12:40 p.m.There were no reported injuries to the 77 passengers or crew on board. Trespassing on railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, followed by railroad-highway grade crossing incidents, Amtrak said.🚨The Berkeley Scanner was the first to report this incident.""These incidents can affect everyone involved,"" Amtrak said, ""those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers. They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and grade crossings."" Amtrak works with Operation Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI) to reduce train fatalities ""by emphasizing the obvious dangers of being on railroad property or disregarding warnings at rail crossings."" It was the second train fatality of the month in BerkeleyThe fatality earlier this month took place Oct. 4 when Amtrak train 545 was en route to Oakland from Sacramento at 5:35 p.m. The Alameda County coroner's office identified the victim from that incident as 56-year-old Selana Williams.In a story over the weekend, the Daily Californian said Williams, who was known as ""Sissy,"" had been unhoused since 2018 and was a beloved member of the People's Park community.For more information on railroad safety, visit StayOffTheTracks.org.This story was updated after publication with several additional details.",Amtrak,AMTK,529,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,10,25,2023,9,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Alameda,CA,6,Berkeley,Unknown,Unknown,K,K,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,1,1,4,4,4,4,Unknown,Unknown,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,A,A,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,40,1,1,2,2,8,8,Unknown,Unknown,8,8,1,1,2,2,1,0,Unknown,Unknown,0,0,77,1,1,0,0,No,No,Unknown,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

OAKLAND, Calif. (KGO) -- An Amtrak train hit a truck in Oakland just before 9 a.m. Thursday, dragging it about 30 yards and immediately sparking a huge fire.

The driver of the truck and his passenger, a co-worker, were able to jump out of the truck before the impact. The driver, 73-year-old Javier Soria, said their truck was stuck on the track.

""All of a sudden, I saw that I got stuck and then I saw the (train) light and said 'Oh, my God.' I tried to go back and forward and he said, 'You have to get out of the truck, that train is going to hit you!' So I ran across the street and tried to stop the Amtrak - but no he wouldn't stop, he just kept going,"" Soria said, showing how he waved his arms in the hopes that the train operator would see him.

The crash happened at the intersection of Fruitvale Ave and E 10th in Oakland.

Soria and his co-worker were hauling garbage and were headed to the dump when he says the truck wheels got stuck on the track. He said he felt some panic but was calm enough to jump out of the truck in time.

EXCLUSIVE: Video shows fiery crash between train, truck in Oakland

Video captured the moment that a truck was struck by an Amtrak train in Oakland, causing the truck to explode into flames.

""The impact was terrible. I was worried about the Amtrak operator, he was in front, he is the one who hit it,"" Soria said.

An Amtrak spokesperson says the Amtrak Coast Starlight train 11 had 111 passengers and crew members on board. No one was hurt.

""All of a sudden it started slowing down, kind of a halt but not too abrupt,"" explained passenger Sonya Kotler. ""Everyone was safe. It wasn't too scary. And then they told us we hit some thing and we had to get off.""

While Sonya got off the train, most passengers remained on the train which continued on after the engines were swapped out.

The train was headed to Los Angeles from Seattle.

Photo: Frances Dinkelspiel
Janae Bell was standing on the Union Pacific railroad tracks around 8:10 p.m. Thursday talking with two friends, Jupiter and Fixie. A freight train was rushing past on one of the tracks, and the trio was waiting for it to pass before crossing at Hearst Avenue near Fourth Street in West Berkeley. They were eating some pastries from Peet’s Coffee.
All of a sudden, Bell looked up and noticed another train hurtling toward him and his friends. He didn’t have time to think. He jumped back and ran off the tracks, bringing his bicycle with him.
Within seconds, Bell turned around. His two friends were gone, run over by the Amtrak train.
“I looked up and saw the lights on the other train,” Bell said Friday, becoming visibly distraught at times while talking to a reporter. “I said, ‘Shit, train,’ and I took off running. When I looked around they were gone.”
The Alameda County coroner’s office on Monday released the name of the two men: Jason Clary, 37, with no fixed address and Jupiter Marley, 31, with no fixed address.
The men were killed Thursday night when they were struck by Train 717 on its way from Bakersfield to Oakland, according to Christina Leeds, a spokeswoman for Amtrak. (Amtrak had identified the train number as 550, which goes from San Jose to Auburn,  on its Twitter page Thursday night. Berkeleyside will seek clarification from Amtrak.)
Jupiter Marley, also known as “Jupiter of the Universe,” was 31, according to public records. Fixie was around 37, said Bell, who is 41. Both of the men who were killed had housed family in Berkeley, he said. They also both had girlfriends who lived on the street. Jupiter had a young daughter around 2.5 years old, said Bell.
After the train hit his friends, Bell was stunned. He wasn’t sure what to do so he returned to an area near Hearst and Second Street known as “the alley.” He had to break the news to his friends’ girlfriends.
“I couldn’t believe what had just happened,” said Bell. “It didn’t seem real to me.”
Some homeless advocates are wondering if recent actions by Caltrans might have upset the men’s equilibrium and in some way contributed to their deaths. Caltrans had just dismantled two nearby homeless encampments along University Avenue where the men were living, one Wednesday and one Thursday. The temperature reached into the high 80s on Thursday, leading Barbara Brust, a homeless advocate, to wonder if the two men killed had been dehydrated, tired and stressed, which led them to make bad judgments.
“Where do we go? Answer us!” #berkmtg #WhereDoWeGoBerkeley homeless persecution by CalTrans, BPD.— JP Massar (@jpmassar) September 13, 2019
Posting on Twitter, JP Massar shared a photograph of Andrea Henson on Thursday as she sat outside Berkeley city offices with signs about the men who died as part of the recently launched “Where do we go?” campaign supporting those experiencing homelessness. The sign included a reference to the hot weather.
But Bell said Jupiter and Fixie seemed good to him in the minutes before their deaths. Jupiter was drinking coffee and had those pastries; Fixie was riding his bike. Neither man was intoxicated, said Bell.
The two men had been living on the streets for at least three or so years, said Bell, who came from Las Vegas a few years ago after he had been shot five times by someone he didn’t know. Both of the men who were killed had been admired, he said.
“Fixie was amazing with bikes; he could fix anything,” said a woman who called herself J. That’s why he had the nickname “Fixie.”
“Jupiter was funny as hell, always goofing around, always smiling,” said J.
Bell said Fixie was “a true Irish dude,” a kind-hearted person who was a whiz on bikes. He was extremely generous, too. But like many living on the streets, something had happened to interrupt his life and hand him hard times, he said.
Jupiter was “the greatest,” said Bell. “He had so much love.”
Bell said the three men had climbed under the train crossing guards, which were down, although the alarms were no longer ringing. The freight train that was rushing by came every night at the same time and took 6-10 minutes to barrel through Berkeley. There isn’t usually another train there at the same time, said Bell.
They didn’t hear the train that struck Jupiter and Fixie, possibly because they were so used to the noise.
“It’s like white noise to us,” he said. “You hear the train all the time so your sensories don’t go off.”
Bell keeps replaying the scene in his head, over and over.
“I was the furthest away from the train,” he said. “I wonder, did they just freeze? Did they run into each other trying to run away? I don’t know. I wish it could all start over again and all of them could move with me.”
Update: Friends of Jason Clary mourned his death on Facebook. Clary was a former employee of the State Bicycle Co. and was a champion bicyclist.

The company put together a video five years ago of Clary riding through San Francisco. A friend made a tribute video of Clary riding his bike.
Marley’s friends are also posting about him on Facebook.

Here is a video that Marley posted to his Facebook page a number of months ago.
Update 9/16: The article was updated to include the full names of the two men killed.

LIVERMORE, Calif. (KGO) -- A driver was killed when an incoming ACE train hit his car Monday morning in Livermore.

It happened just before 8 a.m. at a railroad crossing that is about a quarter-of-a-mile from the Livermore ACE Train station.

Officials say it's early in this investigation, so they still don't have a clear picture of what happened. But according to witnesses, the car appeared to have been in the railroad crossing when it was hit.

According to Brian Schmidt, Director of Operations for ACE Train, investigators are still trying to figure where the car was hit. But he says, if the investigation finds that the driver was in railroad crossing after the crossing arms came down, it would have been difficult for the train to stop.

""It normally takes a passenger train anywhere from half-a-mile to three-quarters-of-a-mile to stop, depending on how fast they are going,"" says Schmidt, adding that the train was likely already slowing down as it approached the station.

He says trains travel about 45 mph, but speeds could be higher in areas where the train is traveling a straight section of tracks.

Justin Todd owns the nearby K.A.R. Service repair shop. He didn't see the accident, but was onhand as the body and car were removed from the intersection.

Todd says it is rare to hear of accident at this railroad crossing, in part because it is heavily patrolled by police.

""You see the police come by and make a big stink about people crossing the tracks, walking across when you are not in the cross walks,"" he explained. ""It seems pretty well regulated.""

Two members of the veteran Oakland R&B-funk band Tower of Power were in critical condition Thursday night after being struck by an Amtrak train near Jack London Square shortly before 8pm, according to several sources including a band spokesperson. They were scheduled to perform two sets at Yoshi’s, the jazz club that borders the transit hub, and a venue where the band plays regularly.

“In an unfortunate accident tonight, two members of the award-winning group Tower Of Power, drummer David Garibaldi and current bassist Marc Van Wageningen, were struck by a train in California,” said their publicist, Jeremy Westby, in a statement. “Both men are responsive and being treated at a local hospital in Oakland.”

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the accident occurred when Garibaldi, Van Wageningen, and two other pedestrians tried to cross the train tracks while the guard arms were down, possibly because they thought the warning was for a slow freight train that had just passed. An Amtrak train was coming at about 25 mph from the other direction on a different track, Oakland Police Sgt. Aaron Smith told the Chronicle. The other two people were apparently able to jump out of the way before the two musicians were struck.

Garibaldi is one of the original members of East Bay R &B group Tower of Power. Van Wageningen was just filling in for their concert Thursday.

RELATED: Tower of Power band members hit by train in serious condition

There are two train crossings by Yoshi's jazz club at Jack London Square for pedestrians, and for cars. There's even a pedestrian bridge over the tracks, but two members of the Tower of Power band ran out of their hotel just before their 8 p.m. started and apparently tried to jaywalk over the tracks along with several others.

A freight train passed, then they ran out and were struck by another oncoming Amtrak train.

Drummer David Garibaldi was rushed to Highland Hospital with face and head injuries according to a Facebook post by the Tower of Power band leader, who also said fill-in bassist Marc Van Wageningen made it through surgery for internal bleeding. Both are in critical condition.

Yoshi's cancelled the band's last two performances in Oakland and fans were stunned. ""I grew up listening to them,"" said Marlena Aying. ""And listening to them this morning on the way in, great music for decades so hearing about the accident, it's very sad.""

""At every crossing there's bars that come down. The lights start to flash as the trains approach, they blow the horns,"" said Dean Agmata who works at Jack London Square.

Those who live and work down here say it's hard to imagine not noticing the warnings of an oncoming train.

At around 6:35 p.m., a woman in a Prius was approaching the railroad crossing on Whipple Rd (near Railroad Ave) when someone struck her vehicle from behind, Union City police Lt. Jeff Snell said.

Although the collision was a “minor” fender bender, it did push the Prius onto the railroad tracks.

The driver saw a train was approaching and decided to abandon the vehicle.

The train did collide with the vehicle, destroying it, Snell said.

None of the 200 passengers on the train was injured.

The driver also did not suffer any injuries.

Roads were closed in the area after the train struck, but everything has since been re-opened.

Passengers were delayed roughly 90 minutes as a result of the crash.

Further details were not immediately available.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) -- New questions are being raised about the deadly train accident that killed a mother and her toddler in San Leandro Tuesday.

Some are wondering whether construction in the area contributed to the accident on Washington Avenue.

Police caution is it is never safe to stop on train tracks, but there was construction in the area where PG &E crews were inspecting a gas pipeline.

Some are worried that created an unusual traffic backup that may have contributed to Tuesday's deadly accident. ""We're all going there someday, but it wasn't their time,"" one man said.

Less than 24 hours after two of his family members were killed, Juan Colmenero returned to grieve and wonder, if somehow this could have been prevented. ""They should have more security right here on these tracks because people come and go, it's devastating,"" Colmenero said.

Vanessa Henriquez, 30, and her daughter Saidy Henriquez, 3, were killed when an Amtrak train plowed into their SUV on Washington Avenue.

A PG &E crew was working in the area and had signs out funneling traffic down to one lane, just past the train crossing.

Henriquez' SUV was backed up in traffic, it's front end was apparently on the tracks when the crossing gates lowered and the train approached. ""There were cars on the track and all the way up to the light,"" Lilla Magee said.

Magee had driven south on Washington Avenue and was stopped in nearly the same spot just two hours earlier. ""Honestly, before this crash even, I just had this feeling like this is bad. You really have to be on your toes to not get caught on the tracks,"" she said.

According to San Leandro police, PG &E had a permit and a city inspector had signed off on the utility's traffic management plan. ""We do send inspectors out on a daily basis to make sure those permits are in full compliance and yesterday the proper signage for the traffic management plan were properly posted,"" San Leandro Police Department Lt. Robert McManus said.

PG &E offered condolences to the Henriquez family and issued a statement saying: ""While the incident is currently under investigation by local authorities, at this point, this incident doesn't appear to be directly related to any pG &E work in the area.""",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,PG&E,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Alameda,CA,6,San Leandro,Washington Avenue,Public,E,E,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,1,1,Unknown,1,1,4,4,4,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,2,2,2,2,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,1,1,1,2,0,Unknown,2,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

San Leandro police identified the victims as 30-year-old Vanessa Henriquez and her 3-year-old daughter, Saidy.
San Leandro Police Department spokesman Lt. Robert McManus said the SUV was parked on the track on the other side of the guardrail. ""There is a construction zone which could have created some confusion,"" McManus said. Both mother and child died on impact, he said.
The family was in shock Tuesday. Jose Nelson Portillo confirmed to NBC Bay Area that it was his sister-in-law and niece in the SUV. He said the family has a boy with autism, and Hernriquez was on her way to pick him up.

One witness said the conductor tried to stop the train and was concerned when he got closer to the wreckage.
""I went down there, and the conductor came out of the train,"" said Weston Pokorny. ""He said, 'Please tell me people got out of the car.' He was checking the train. I said no one got out of the car.""
There were no injuries to the 39 people on board, Amtrak said. All passengers were transported by bus to an Amtrak station to continue on to Sacramento.

The maximum train speed in that area is 79 mph, but it was not immediately known how fast the train was going, Amtrak said.
""I don’t know what speeds the Amtrak train was traveling at but do know that as they pass these rail passings they do go at a very high rate of speed which would explain why that car was trapped in the tracks,"" McManus said.
Emergency crews and paramedics could be spotted at the scene of the crash, which showed the SUV trapped underneath the train.
""The train basically dragged the car all the way down - it stopped pretty fast, but it was too late,"" a man who was eating lunch at a nearby restaurant told NBC Bay Area. ""I suddenly turned around and heard this impact ... Wham!""
According to police, the train pushed the SUV to what appears to be an eight and a quarter of a mile down the train tracks.
""I heard the screeching and then bang,"" said Western Pokorny, who spoke with the conductor moments after the crash.
""He said, 'Please tell me they got out of the vehicle.' I said, 'No one got out the of the vehicle they are gone.'""
On Monday, a man was hit and killed by an Amtrak train traveling from San Jose to Sacramento in San Leandro, officials said. Train No. 528 was traveling from San Jose to Sacramento when it struck the man around 10:30 a.m. near Davis Street and Orchard Avenue, Amtrak said.
There were two more train-related accidents Monday. The first accident occurred at 6:45 a.m. when Caltrain No. 305 struck and killed a man in Burlingame.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) -- A mother and her toddler were killed when an Amtrak train slammed into their SUV in the East Bay.

The incident happened Tuesday afternoon on Washington Avenue and Halcyon Drive in San Leandro at around 1:30 p.m.

The Alameda County coroner identified the mother and daughter as 30-year-old Vannessa Henriquez and 3-year-old Saidy.

Police say Henriquez of Oakland was in that SUV with her 3 year old daughter, Saidy.

Jose Portillo, a relative, says the family is devastated he calls Henriquez a dedicated, hard-working mom. He says she was on her way to pick up her son, who has autism, but she didn't arrive, and police were called.

The Amtrak Capitol Corridor Train No. 532 had 39 passengers on board and was heading northbound from San Jose to Sacramento when it crashed into the dark SUV with a woman and young child inside. Officials said none of the passengers aboard the train were injured.

The SUV was caught on the tracks with no way to escape. ""It appears that the vehicle that was struck today was trapped in traffic. It was stuck there prior to the railroad arms going down and was unable to get off the tracks safely before it was impacted at a high rate of speed by the Amtrak train,"" San Leandro Police Department Lt. Bob McManus said.

""I have two kids, and it just hurts my heart you know,"" said San Leandro resident Jackie Moniz.

Moniz said she's always careful near this rail crossing.

On Monday, a pedestrian was struck and killed by a train less than a mile from the site of Tuesday's crash.

Henriquez and her daughter are a sad, sobering reminder about danger on the tracks.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. - A 30-year-old mother from Oakland and her 3-year-old daughter were killed in a collision between an Amtrak train and a vehicle in San Leandro Tuesday afternoon.
Alameda County Fire and Paramedics Plus personnel responded and pronounced the mother, Vanessa Henriquez and her 3-year-old daughter, Saidy, both of Oakland, deceased at the scene.
Robert McManus with San Leandro police said the collision occurred on the railroad tracks in the area of Washington Avenue and Chapman Road.
A witness told KTVU that the black Toyota Rav 4 SUV was stopped on the tracks when the train hit it.
Firefighters responded at 1:19 p.m. to reports that a woman and child were killed in a collision on the railroad tracks in the area of Washington Avenue and Chapman Road, fire spokeswoman Aisha Knowles said.
Responding officers found the Amtrak train stopped on the tracks, approximately ¼ mile north of Chapman Rd., with the SUV trapped underneath its front rail car. Officers attempted life-saving measures on the mother and her child, but were unsuccessful.
Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham said the train involved was Capitol Corridor Train No. 532 that was headed from San Jose to the Sacramento area.
Graham said 39 people were on the train at the time and were uninjured. They were being taken to a bus to a nearby station this afternoon, she said.
Graham said she did not immediately have any information about what led up to the collision, but noted that trains going through that area in San Leandro have a maximum speed of 79 mph.
Washington Avenue was closed in the area following the collision, but reopened as of 3 p.m., San Leandro police.
Henriquez leaves behind a husband who is Saidy's father, and a son who is in the third grade. Relatives weren't sure if the son is 8 or 9 years old.
It's a very tough time. She was a very loving mother very responsible, always with her children,"" said Evelyn Henriquez, the victim's cousin.
The family said Vanessa was probably tending to her family as she always did as a devoted stay at home mother of two.
""She was running daily errands, things that she did daily as a mother; picking up groceries, dropping off her son,"" said Mauro Henriquez, the victim's cousin. She loved just to be with her family. This could have happened to anyone, but unfortunately it was us.""
Relatives say Vanessa was planning a trip to Hawaii with her family next month.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) -- Monday evening a teenage girl on her cellphone stepped into the path of an oncoming train. It happened at Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive in San Leandro.

ABC7 News has covered train fatalities at the same railroad crossing before, but this victim lived in a bottom floor apartment across the street. You would think she would be highly aware of the dangers, but even we were surprised at how quickly the train flies through the area. You cannot afford to be distracted.

Brittney Silva, 18, routinely crossed these train tracks, next to her home at Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive. But this time witnesses say the senior at San Leandro High School was distracted.

Witness Cindy Lu says her friend tried to warn her. She said, ""He yelled. He screamed so loud, he was nervous, he screamed so loud, but she doesn't hear because she had a phone to her ear.""

Cynthia Silva, Brittney's mother, told ABC7 News, ""She wanted to be an OBGYN. She wanted to help bring babies into this world."" She says her daughter was the strong one in a home where she admits they had challenges. She said the things she would miss most were: ""her smile, her hugs, her, the way she used to soothe me when I was upset.""



""She turned her grades around and made it possible. She got into UC Santa Cruz and she got into Humboldt, and Cal State East Bay. Just a few years ago that wouldn't have been possible,"" San Leandro High School assistant principal Elisa Alvarez said.

Just last month, a car crashed into the Silva's apartment, shaving off their balcony.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) -- A high school senior lost her life because she was distracted by her cellphone and her grieving mother has a message.

A train quickly sped by and 18-year-old Brittney Silva did not get out of the way. The accident happened next to her home in San Leandro on Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive.

Witnesses say she had earbuds on and when they yelled out a warning, there was no reaction. She couldn't hear it.

Brittney's mother, Cynthia Silva, said, ""I need her to come back and I need these youngsters to take their headphones out of their dang ears. She was listening to music. She had both of her headphones in and she was texting.""



Cynthia showed us what she thinks happened to her daughter Brittney as the teen walked across the train tracks near their San Leandro home just before 6 p.m. Monday night.

""And she's looking down like this and you can't see the arms come down behind her. And the arms came down behind her, she had her headphones in and she couldn't hear the train coming,"" said Cynthia.

Brittney died instantly when an Amtrak train hit her at a high speed on at the intersection of Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive, just a few yards from her family's apartment. Because of the earbuds, Brittney didn't hear a witness yell for her to get out of the way.

Cynthia made a public plea to other young people, ""I will tell all of the other youngsters out there. When you're walking down the street, and you've got your headphones on, keep one headphone in and one out so you can hear the world around you.""

Brittney was a senior at San Leandro High school, all set to go to the prom this weekend and graduate in June.

""She was just always so nice and complimenting people all the people all the time. She's so outgoing and loving. This is such a tragic thing to happen for someone who is so special,"" said Lilian McLean, a friend.

At San Leandro High, students signed a big sheet of paper with their condolences to Brittney's family, including her mother and 11-year-old sister.

""Everyone loved her, everyone knew her, she would always dance and she would always give me great advice about life,"" said Melody Silva, Brittney's sister.

The incident occurred at 5:33 pm at Main Street at Big Break Road when a train struck a silver sedan causing major damage and shutting down the roadway.

According to preliminary information, two occupants of the vehicle were able to exit the vehicle prior to the train striking the vehicle according to police .

As of 6:09 pm, the area was shut down to traffic in both directions leaving the Vintage Parkway Neighborhood with one exit.

It is not yet known why the vehicle was stopped on the train tracks. Oakley Police have not yet released any information on the incident.

UPDATE: City of Oakley



At 5:33PM on January 19, 2025, Oakley officers were dispatched to the railroad tracks at Big Break Road and Main Street to investigate a vehicle that had been struck by a train. Our officers arrived and found a female near the collision site. Our officers determined the female was the driver, and sole occupant of the vehicle, and she began experiencing vehicle problems as she was approaching the tracks.

The female drove off of the road right at one set of the tracks, seemingly in an attempt to move her vehicle off of the road. The vehicle became stuck on the tracks because of this movement. The female saw a train was coming at her while she was stuck so she got out of her vehicle to avoid injury, or worse. The train hit the vehicle causing major damage to the vehicle.

It did not appear as if there were any intoxication issues associated with this incident, but investigation was turned over to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway Police Department for investigation.

Please make sure that when pulling over near train tracks, you have cleared the actual tracks. We encourage you to save the train emergency hotline number for the BNSF Resource Operations Call Center, 1-800-832-5452, in your phone or in your glovebox. The center is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

OAKLEY, Contra Costa County (CBS SF) -- A freight train hit a vehicle on the tracks in Oakley Wednesday, killing a 12-year-old boy and critically injuring a woman.
The collision happened at about 12:53 p.m. at a railroad crossing at E. Cypress Road just east of Main St.
A 19-year-old woman was airlifted to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek with critical injuries while three other people were taken by ambulance to area hospitals, according to Fire Marshal Steve Aubert with the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District.
On Wednesday afternoon, Oakley Union Elementary School District Superintendent Jeff Palmquist said in a letter to parents that the victim was a student at Delta Vista Middle School, a block away from the railroad crossing.
A witness said it appeared a grey Lexus SUV tried to beat the train after the railroad crossing arms were coming down and was struck in the rear portion of the vehicle. At least one other vehicle was hit in the collision.

The shaken witness said she was in a truck one vehicle away from the crash directly in front of her.
""As the car went through the gates went down and its ass end was still sitting in the train tracks. The train went through and then all of a sudden I just heard a big crunch and I looked over and the car flew off the road and then the tires were going and there was debris hitting my truck - and I called 9-1-1,"" said the unidentified witness. ""It was sickening. Just scary.""
Another witness said he also saw the crash from inside his own vehicle.
""I saw a big cloud of dust and then I saw the train come to a grinding halt, and then everybody got out and started - it was obviously some attention being paid,"" said witness Edward Harris. ""So I get up and got out of my car and I looked and I saw the SUV sitting there. Everything had just happened so we all got out and I called 9-1-1.""
Harris said he thought about his own children after learning of the young victim involved in the crash.
It's heartbreaking. I've got children who go to school right over here at Delta Vista [Middle School],"" he said. ""I heard that there was a younger person that was reportedly involved and my heart just goes out to the family and I'm just praying for them. ""
LaQuan Ashford, who has a child at Delta Vista told KPIX 5, ""I go stand at that track and wait for my daughter to cross because of that reason. There's always a train crossing during their school time.""
Ashford said train traffic is such a problem that he has reached out to have the city set some limits on trains coming through the area, especially during pick up and drop off hours.
""There is a long line all the way across. So everyone is sitting bumper to bumper waiting to get to this light,"" Ashford said. ""So the train, coming at that time, anyone can get stuck on the track. Anyone, at any given time.""
Oakley city officials said they have implemented road striping changes and adjusted the timing of the traffic signals to ease congestion.
The East Contra Costa Fire Protection District treated three other victims and released them at the scene.
It was the third train crash in East Contra Costa County this year and the second in one week. On Aug. 20, an Amtrak passenger train collided with a big rig in Brentwood resulting in a minor injury. In May, a truck parked on the tracks was hit by a train in Orwood, resulting in an injury to the driver.
""If the crossing arms are down, don't ever try to beat a train. They're down for a reason,"" said ECCFPD Battalion Chief Ross Macumber. ""The train comes through at a high rate of speed and they don't stop for a long time. So never try to beat a train, never drive around the crossing arm, and if it's an uncontrolled train intersection, always turn off your radio, roll down your window and listen and look before you cross.""",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,8,12,2023,12,PM,Unknown,Unknown,Contra Costa County,CA,6,Oakley,E.

Aug. 26—OAKLEY, CA — A collision between multiple vehicles and a freight train killed a 12-year-old boy and critically injured a 19-year-old girl Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.
At 12:53 p.m., East Contra Costa Fire Protection District firefighters responded to the railroad crossing at East Cypress Road and Main Street for a report of a collision involving a freight train and three vehicles, battalion chief Steve Aubert said.
According to Oakley police who also responded to the scene, one vehicle had overturned, with at least one victim suffering from head trauma and in and out of consciousness.
After firefighters arrived and began assisting, the 12-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. The boy's mother, Melissa Schaefer, spoke to this news organization at the scene and identified him as Joshua Schaefer.
The 19-year-old was flown by REACH medical helicopter to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek and preliminarily listed in critical condition.
The Oakley Union Elementary School District's board of trustees offered ""our deepest sympathies to the family, the Delta Vista School community, and school communities throughout the district who are impacted by the tragedy that occurred earlier today,"" an e-mailed statement read in part Wednesday night. ""The district's crisis management team is providing counseling and bereavement support services, on-site, to our students and staff to help everyone cope with the events of today.""
This is the second train-vehicle collision East Contra Costa firefighters have responded to within a week, after an Amtrak train out of Stockton struck a semi tractor-trailer at an Orwood Road crossing just after 2:45 p.m. last Friday. That truck's driver escaped with minor injury, while no one aboard the train was injured.
Oakley police will handle an initial investigation into the incident with help from other agencies.

(KRON) – A 12-year-old boy has died after being hit by a train, according to Oakley officials.

The incident occurred near the intersection of East Cypress Road and Main Street at 12:53 p.m.

“All of a sudden I just heard a big crunch and I looked over and the car flew off the road and then tires were going and then debris was hitting my truck,” a witness said.

The 12-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene and the 19-year-old driver of the vehicle was transported to John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek to be treated for serious injuries.

According to the boy’s family, his 19-year-old half-sister had just picked him up from school.

Police say another car had been struck by the car that was hit by the train. Passengers in the other vehicle were not injured.

According to authorities, the back portion of the sedan was struck by the train and it appears all signals in the area were operating correctly.

“I saw a big cloud of dust and then I saw the train come to a grinding halt. Everything had just happened so we all got out. I called 911,” another witness said.

Officials say this is the third train versus car incident in the area this year.

“Advice is always, you gotta look both directions, turn your radio down, listen and hear if a train is coming but if the crossing arms are down, don’t ever try to beat a train, they’re down for a reason,” Battalion Chief Ross Macumber, East Contra Costa Fire Protection District, said.

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- A Fresno family was almost to their destination Tuesday night - Christmas Tree Lane - when the back of their minivan was struck by a six-car Amtrak train near the intersection of Shields and Wishon.

RELATED: 5-year-old child killed in train crash while family waited to enter Christmas Tree Lane

The force of the crash killed a 5-year-old boy, identified by the Fresno County Sheriff's Office as Anton Solorio.

On Wednesday, area residents were still in shock, trying to understand what went wrong on the tracks.

""To hear something like this, it's a rip in the fabric of our universe,"" says John Alden.

Adds Debi Ruud:

""We couldn't even imagine how it can happen.""

The cause of the crash is still under investigation.

But Fresno Police say it appears the railroad signals were working at the time and that the train engineer applied the brakes and used the horn.

They believe the boy's mother was driving the van and simply thought she had cleared the tracks when she hadn't.

""It's a tragedy, it's an unnecessary loss of life, and it's something that's absolutely avoidable so we just need to remind motorists about safety,"" says Fresno Police Deputy Chief Michael Reid.

JD Sanders lives nearby, and is still processing what he saw and heard last night, hoping it never happens again.

""I ran down there and heard the mother screaming and I had to come back to my house because it was too much for me,"" he says. ""It's pretty terrible.""

Sanders called 911, and by the time he went back outside, police were everywhere.

The boy's mother, who is pregnant, was brought to the hospital to get checked out.

His grandmother and younger sibling were in the car too and also expected to be ok.

On Wednesday, Valerie Espinoza stopped by the scene to pay her respects to the little boy who passed away.

""I just came to bring some balloons because I felt very bad for the child, you know he's a baby,"" she said.

She also shared an important reminder for all families.

""Just cherish life because life is so precious.""

Fresno Police are reminding everyone that trains pass through the intersection frequently, and that they move fast, and take a long time to stop.

The train was going at approximately 70 miles per hour.

Robert Solorio, Anton's father, released a statement to Action News about the family's heartbreaking loss.

FRESNO, Calif. -- Authorities are investigating a deadly crash involving an Amtrak train and a van in Fresno County. The crash happened around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday near Conejo and Peach avenues.

The California Highway Patrol has confirmed that two men were killed. Officers say both men were riding in the van, when it attempted to cross the train tracks and was hit by the train.

An Amtrak spokesperson says the train, 702 San Joaquin, left from Sacramento and was headed to Bakersfield with a stop in Hanford scheduled. The train was delayed for a few hours before continuing to the South Valley.



The CHP says none of the 181 passengers on board was hurt in the crash, but investigators were checking the area to make sure no one else was in the van who may have been ejected during the collision.

The cause of the crash is unclear at this point. Some roadways in the area are shut down as the investigation continues.

Just before 7:30 a.m., Corcoran police officers were dispatched to the railroad crossing intersection of Orange and Otis avenues regarding a train colliding with a vehicle.

Officers arrived on scene and made contact with the driver of the vehicle, a 41-year-old man from Exeter, officials said.

The man was the sole occupant of the vehicle and officers said he complained of pain to his abdomen due to the impact from the collision. They said he was later transported to a local hospital for medical treatment. His condition was unavailable.

Based on the investigation, officers said they determined the man was traveling eastbound in his vehicle when it was struck in the rear passenger side by a Burlington Northern Santa Fe train traveling northbound at the intersection.

Police said the man’s vehicle, a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu, sustained major damage to the rear end and a railroad crossing arm was also damaged due to the collision.

Officials said the conductor of the train told officers that the man’s vehicle was seen entering the crossing while the railroad arms were down as the train was approaching. The conductor also said they sounded the train’s horn several times before it struck the vehicle, police said.

Authorities said no one on the train was injured and there was no damage to the train.

The Corcoran Police Department reminds motorists and pedestrians to follow these railroad crossing safety tips:
• Slow down when approaching a railroad crossing and look both ways twice.
• Never race a train to cross the tracks.
• Never pass another vehicle within 100 feet of a railroad crossing.
• Watch out for vehicles that must stop at railroad crossings, such as school buses or trucks carrying hazardous materials.
• When approaching a crossing, roll down your windows, turn off the radio or air conditioner and listen for whistles or bells.
• Always yield to flashing lights, whistles, closing gates or stop signs.
• If you must stop, keep a distance of at least 15 feet from the tracks.

Amtrak; 42 minor injuries - USA Today","Big rig hits, derails Calif. Amtrak; 42 minor injuries
An Amtrak train derailed this afternoon after a tractor-trailer truck drove into it at a crossing in California's San Joaquin Valley. Authorities said up to 50 people suffered mostly minor to moderate injuries.
Hours later, a truck drove into a freight train on tracks several miles from the Amtrak derailment.
Update at 8:31 p.m. ET: About four hours after the Amtrak derailment, a truck drove into a freight train, Kings County authorities say.
The silage truck hit the train around 4 p.m. PT (7 p.m. ET) about 18 miles from the Amtrak derailment, near Hanford, KMPH-TV says. The driver suffered unspecified injuries. The freight train did not derail.
Update at 7:11 p.m. ET: Officials say 42 people were taken to six area hospitals, mostly for minor injuries or complaints of pain, the Fresno paper reports.
Update at 6:40 p.m. ET: Witnesses said the crossing arms were lowered at the guarded crossing, the Fresno Bee says. The truck was carrying cotton trash.
As configured, the engine was the last car, and the truck hit between it and the last passenger car, said Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham.
She said that 169 passengers were aboard and that all injuries were not life-threatening. The train crew was not hurt. The truck driver's condition was not reported.
Update at 6:07 p.m. ET: KMPH reports that a baby was thrown from the train but not seriously injured.
Update at 5:30 p.m. ET: Kings County authorities now say between 40 and 50 passengers suffered minor to moderate injuries, mostly bumps, bruises and possible fractures, KTVU-TV reports.
The sheriff's department also says the southbound train hit the big rig at a crossing. Three of the five cars derailed.
The train left Oakland at 10:05 a.m. (1:05 p.m. ET) with between 120 and 150 passengers.
Original post: An Amtrak train derailed this afternoon in California's southern San Joaquin Valley after an accident involving a big rig, injuring 22 passengers and the truck driver, according to the highway patrol.

They were the first on the scene when they rushed to help rescue passengers.

Raymie Howard, 23, Andy Saiz, 31, and Leslie Saiz, 39, were in the back yard area of their home — empty fields bordering Kansas Avenue and 10th Avenue, just south of Hanford — when a semi truck with two trailers hauling cotton trash hit the last car of an Amtrak train heading to Bakersfield.

“I was just standing in the back yard while one of the other guys was on the quad when BOOM,” Howard said. “It looked like the whole back train was on fire.”

But what looked like smoke turned out to be black, thick dust.

The crash injured about 40 of the train’s 170 passengers, but none seriously. Even the driver of the truck suffered only minor injuries.

“I ran over there. It was incredible,” Howard said. “That truck was going west but after hitting the back end of the train, it flipped 180 degrees and ended up facing the opposite way.”

Howard and the Saiz brothers were the first on the scene at the railroad crossing on Kansas Avenue. The glanced at the train, they said, and saw it “wobbling” down the tracks.

“Everything was gone. His engine was gone. The cab of the truck was gone. All that was left was one small bubble where the driver sat,” Howard said. “The dude was just sitting there, not making any noise. He wasn’t responding — he was unconscious.”

A few seconds later, the man began to moan.

“I didn’t want to touch him. Just then a probation officer pulled up and said the train had just derailed,” Howard said. “He was checking the truck driver and hehad merun up thetracks looking to see if any passengers had been thrown out of the train. We nev­er saw anyone along the way.”

But as they approached thederailed train,thesight was frightening.

“People were coming out with broken arms and broken legs — you could tell just by looking at them andthewaytheyheldtheir [limbs.] There was a lot of crying. Even people who were not hurt were all crying,” Howardsaid.“Everyone was freaking out.”

Howard said he saw a lady with a crying month-old baby covered in what appeared to be black soot and dirt.

“It scared me. I took off my shirt and gave it to the lady to clean the baby’s face up,” Howard said. “The baby was not even hers. She had picked it up and was looking for the mother.”

Andy Saiz said he was on the quad, heard the hit, andlookeduptoseeahuge cloud of dust.

“It was so thick, I could not see in front of me. It was bad,” Andy Saiz said. “I was shocked. There was no motor left to the truck. It was gone. The drivers’ feet were hanging off the bottom of the cab that was now gone. I kept shouting ‘Can you hear me?’ but got no response.”

Saiz rushed to the train and saw a lady with a broken arm, he said.

“The [passengers] were coming out of the doors and getting pulled out of windows,” Andy Saiz said. “There were a lot of old ladies and old men covered in black dirt.”

LeslieSaiz said hetalked to one of the men.

“His face was all bloody and he had dirt and glass all over his face so I ran to help him,” Leslie Saiz said. “He said he was sitting looking out the window as thetrain was crossing [Kansas Avenue.] He saw the truck and the way he told it, the truck only slowed. It did not stop completely.”

Leslie Saiz said the passenger told him hethought the driver miscalculated the train’s passing.

“It seemed like he slowed to let the train pass but then either he sped up or the train slowed, and the truck hit the last train car,” Leslie Saiz said. “At least that’s what it sounded like.”

The collision occurred a few minutes after noon on Monday — with the first 9-1-1 call received at 12:22 p.m., said Jerry Pierce, California Highway Patrol Public Affairs Officer, Hanford office.

“Two minutes later we got an updatethat thetrain wasinfactanAmtraktrain and that some of the cars had partially overturned,” Pierce said.

Thecollision was reported as occurring on Kansas Avenue at the rail road crossing, between 10th and 10 and a half.

“The train came to rest about two football fields past the point of impact,” Pierce said.

The driver was pulling two trailers of ‘cotton trash’ and had minor to moderate injuries.

As Pierce checked on the driver, emergency personnel had been on the scene for an approximate 30 minutes.

“The majority of the passengers were checked and treated just outside the train,” Pierce said.

Brett Blanchard, who was identified as the engineer of the Amtrak passenger train that collided with the semitrailer, did not appear to be injured.

Pierce placed an initial report of an approximate 150 to 200 passengers on the train, which had just leftHanfordandwasheading to Bakersfield.

“The initial report of the injured is between 30 and 50,” Pierce said. “Most of the injuries are minor. I have not heard of any major or severe injuries. No one was transported by lifeline — indicating serious injuries — away from the scene.”

Pierce also praised the prompt help from numerous entities, including Kings County Sheriff, Hanford Police Department,Kings County Probation, Kings County District Attorney’s Office, Kings County Fire Department and fire volunteers, Hanford Fire Department and volunteers, and other fire personnel.

Numerous ambulances responded to the site and a triage area sorted passengers based on their need for immediate medical treatment.

The injured were transported to hospitals in Hanford, Tulare and Visalia.

TulareRegional Medical Center reported receiving 10 patients for medical evaluation, and Kaweah Delta District Hospital, Visalia, reported having received nine patients with moderate injuries and four more on enroute at 3:39 p.m.

The majority of the passengers were transported by Hanford Joint Union High School District buses to the Hanford Civic Auditorium.

“From there, those that choose to, will be transported by Amtrak to a connection in Bakersfield,” Pierce said. “I was told the [rail] line will be down a minimum of four hours, and that was at 2 p.m., so we’re looking ‘till 6 p.m. at least.”

Members of the public who think they may have a family member involved in the incident sould call Amtrak at 1-800-523-9010.

The train struck the unidentified person around 11:10 a.m. near the 7000 block of North Tujunga Avenue, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.
There was no immediate description of the pedestrian or what led to the person being struck. Fire officials said 33 passengers were on the train, but no additional injuries were reported.
The Metrolink tracks between Burbank and Van Nuys were shut down while an investigation was conducted, leading to some trip cancellations by the regional rail service.
In 2024, at least four people were killed in accidents involving Metrolink trains along the segment of tracks between Burbank and Glendale. And in February, a man was killed in Boyle Heights after he was struck by a Metrolink train.
Vehicles have also been involved in collisions on Burbank tracks in recent years.
According to data published by the Federal Railroad Administration, California leads the nation in railroad fatalities, with 185 deaths in 2024, though that number fell from 251 in 2023.
“Metrolink continually works to communicate to the community, riders and the general public that people need to be aware anytime they’re around the tracks or at intersections,” according to Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson. “Obviously, trespassing is a crime, but we are concerned with the bigger picture issues that result in injury and loss of life.”
Homeless encampments near train tracks are related to increased cases of death or injury, said Johnson. In fact, he noted, in areas where law enforcement has identified higher rates of homelessness, the rates of pedestrian-train injuries and fatalities are higher.
“We recognize that homeless encampments, or people living near or using rights of way as a thoroughfare, or actually as a place to live, can lead to dangerous situations involving trains,” Johnson said.
Metrolink has invested significant resources into suicide prevention, rail safety education and awareness, and technology, he said. Recently, Metrolink received funding for a track intrusion detection system.
“This is one example of Metrolink trying to proactively use technologies to keep people off of the right of way. And if, for some reason, they still find their way onto the tracks or along the right of way, this system would allow the engineers of the trains advance notice to either slow or stop their trains,” Johnson said.
The pedestrian fatality on Wednesday is still being investigated, and a cause of death will likely be determined by the L.A. County coroner’s office in the next 60 days.

A Metrolink train struck a car in the City of Industry on Thursday morning, killing two people inside the vehicle, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirmed.
Metrolink Train 407 hit a white Toyota Camry on the tracks near the intersection of Rose Hills Road and Capitol Avenue, killing Grecia Garcia Sofia, 19; and Pamela Gutierrez Guizar, 47, according to L.A.

A pedestrian died Monday morning after they were hit by a freight train traveling through South Los Angeles.

The collision happened around 7:20 a.m. near the intersection of Florence Avenue and Graham Avenue in the Florence-Firestone neighborhood.

The pedestrian was hit by a Union Pacific freight train and was declared dead at the scene.

Union Pacific, the second-largest railroad operator in the U.S. and one of the most prominent in the world, confirmed to KTLA that a pedestrian was struck and killed by one of its trains, adding that the crew onboard was uninjured.

A spokesperson said the company was working with local authorities to “understand what led up to the incident.”

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the L.A. County Fire Department were among the agencies to responded to the scene.

Trespassing on train tracks is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in the United States, according to the Transportation Department. It is a misdemeanor in California that can result in jail time or hundreds of dollars in penalties.

Where on the tracks the collision happened is unclear, but the nearby intersection is at-grade, meaning at street level, and is protected only by crossing gates and lights.

The DOT urges pedestrians to “always expect a train” when near tracks, as they don’t always follow a set schedule, don’t always sound warning horns when approaching a crossing and can take upwards of a mile to come to a complete stop.

“Even when you are not standing directly on the tracks, you risk being hit by a train by being on railroad property,” the DOT says.

Maseeh Muhammad was identified by the L.A. County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office to have been fatally struck near the intersection of Golden Triangle Road and Ruether Avenue.

Muhammad, a Santa Clarita resident, was 21 years old at the time of his death, 25 days away from his 22nd birthday.

The collision occurred at approximately 6:30 p.m. Passengers and crew of the train were either interviewed by sheriff’s deputies or escorted off the train — which was approximately 700 feet from where the collision took place.

Lt. Richard O’Neil, watch commander for the SCV Sheriff’s Station, said the collision does not appear to be a suicide, but rather appears to be an accident.

At the scene of the incident on Monday night, a woman and man waited while deputies investigated. The woman, extremely distraught, believed the victim was her son who had been out walking a dog. The victim’s identity had yet to be officially confirmed at the time.

Metrolink lines were delayed on the Antelope Valley line well into the evening.

The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station is investigating the incident, at the time of this publication.

SANTA FE SPRINGS, Calif. (KABC) -- A recreational vehicle that was left on train tracks in Santa Fe Springs was struck by a Metrolink train and burst into flames Friday morning.

Authorities say the fiery collision occurred shortly after 5:30 a.m. near the intersection of Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues. Fire crews believe the RV stalled at the Rosecrans Avenue intersection and was struck by the OC Line 681, which was carrying over 100 passengers and was heading from Orange County to Los Angeles.

Dramatic video shared on social media shows the moment the train slammed into the RV and pushed it along the track. The video appears to show people fleeing from the RV, and witnesses told police four people were seen running from the site of the collision moments before the crash.

Firefighters were seen dousing flames that gutted the vehicle and charred a rail car. Smoke from the fire could be seen for several miles.

Flames engulf Metrolink train after crash on tracks in Santa Fe Springs

A recreational vehicle that was left on train tracks in Santa Fe Springs was struck by a Metrolink train and burst into flames Friday morning.

""We got buffeted around pretty good, and it felt like we might derail for a second or two,"" train passenger Mike Lozano said.

Shortly after the collision, a freight train arrived on the parallel tracks.

""You could hear it coming, and it was coming really fast, you could tell,"" Lozano said.

Another passenger said he braced for potential impact as he heard the sound of the freight train quickly approaching.

""That was honestly the longest few seconds of my life, like when I heard the train horn coming, I was just looking around, everyone was looking around, are we even going to be safe? Do they know that this just happened? Because it sounded like they didn't,"" Ryan Hajek described.

The freight train ran over debris from the crash before coming to a stop as the fire from the Metrolink train started to spread.

AIR7 HD was over the scene, where dozens of evacuated passengers waited in a nearby parking lot while crews battled the flames. Four passengers who suffered minor injuries were treated and later released, according to officials.

""The hit was such an impact on the train,"" passenger Rosalind Carter said. ""I remember being flung into the seat next to me, I hit my head, it was just pretty traumatic.""

WATCH: Passenger describes frightening experience following Metrolink crash

A man who said he was a Metrolink passenger told Eyewitness News that a train crashed into a vehicle slammed on the brakes as it was approaching the intersection in Santa Fe Springs.

The crash caused significant train delays and cancellations. Metrolink offered ticket reimbursements for some customers and advised affected passengers to find their own transportation as ""alternate"" transportation was limited.

Many passengers who frequently ride the train said the crash could've been a lot worse but were thankful for the quick response of Metrolink employees and first responders.

""I got a couple more weeks of work, I'm retiring in December. So yeah, just wanna get through this thing and come out on the other end,"" Lozano said.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

Metrolink service experienced extensive delays Friday morning after a fiery crash between a Los Angeles-bound train and an RV in Santa Fe Springs prompted officials to shut down the tracks between Buena Park and Norwalk.Authorities received a report of a crash near the intersection of Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues around 5:37 a.m., Whittier police Officer Hugo Figueroa said. Police arrived to find a Metrolink train that had struck a stalled RV on the tracks, igniting a fire that consumed the RV and burned the front portion of the train. A freight train traveling parallel to the Metrolink train halted to a stop but was partially burned in the fire, Figueroa said. Metrolink identified the passenger train involved as the Orange County 681 Line train traveling to L.A. Aerial video from Sky5 showed passengers exit the train as the fire burned. Four people who complained of pain were treated at the scene and released, Figueroa said. The fire was mostly contained by 6:10 a.m. It’s unclear why the RV was on the tracks, but witnesses reported seeing four people fleeing from the vehicle, according to Whittier police. Officers were working on speaking to the registered owner, who lives near Santa Fe Springs, Figueroa said. The incident has shut down the tracks between the Buena Park and Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs stations, said Metrolink. L.A. County officials previously announced the tracks were expected to remain closed all day, but they later said one track was opened just before 9 a.m. Because of the closure, the 91PVL and 600 line trains were unable to get through the area, according to Metrolink . OC Line 603 to Los Angeles has been canceled at Fullerton for the day, the agency tweeted around 7:30 a.m. Passengers can get around the shutdown via MTA or OCTA buses. Other cancelations during the day included IEOC Line 811 to Laguna Niguel, RIV Line 406 to downtown Riverside, and SB lines 316, 320 and 328 to downtown San Bernardino. Several lines experienced delays, the result of train congestion caused by the track shut down. Afternoon trains were also impacted due to the closure. In addition, IEC Line 815 to Oceanside, OC lines 609 and 641 to Los Angeles, and OC Line 602 to Oceanside were all canceled mid-afternoon after a person was hit by by a train on the tracks, according to Metrolink. That incident prompted the closure of tracks between San Clemente and Oceanside. Because of the mass service disruption, officials have urged commuters to seek alternate transportation, adding that they could be reimbursed for costs. Those with valid fares for the 681, 601, 603, 701 and 700 trains are being offered vouchers of up to $50 for use of alternate transit such as Uber, Lyft or a taxi.

Firefighters worked quickly to extinguish a blaze that ignited after a Metrolink commuter train collided with a recreational vehicle in Santa Fe Springs before dawn Friday.

The crash occurred just before 6 a.m. near Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues, said Eric Ortiz, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The commuter train, RV and an adjacent freight train all caught fire.

Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said 120 passengers were on the Orange County 681 Line train headed toward Los Angeles at the time of the crash. No passengers were injured and everyone was evacuated safely, Johnson said. The train operator, who was closest to the collision, is also safe, he said. It was not immediately clear whether anyone in the RV was injured.

All trains that run along the same tracks, including the Perris Valley 91 Line and Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner trains, will experience delays. Johnson said Metrolink does not have an estimate for how long delays will be.

Two events were held to raise funds for Jimenez-Soto’s family — a car wash and a food sale.
“She was a sweetheart. she was the most amazing, beautiful girl ever,” said Juliana Georgy, a 15-year-old friend of Jimenez-Soto.
The teen was a junior at Golden Valley High School.
“I miss her smile around me. She was a really good person,” she said. “I wasn’t that close to her but she mean a lot, we lost someone.”
A coroner’s official said Sunday that preliminary reports indicate Jimenez-Soto’s death was a suicide. Homicide officials are still investigating, but they were not available Sunday.
A GoFundMe page was setup to help the family raise funds for the teens funeral.
The food sale held at Canyon Country Park from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. was run by friends and family. The family and friends sold tacos and sodas among other foods.
“We would always go to the movies after school. We would just go to the theater and watch what was playing,” said George Polacmo, a 17-year-old classmate and friend of Jimenez-Soto. “She would come in the middle of the night to talk to me. I was really close with her.”
Many of Jimenez-Soto’s family and close friends did not want to comment and requested privacy.
“She always had a smile on her face,” said 15-year-old classmate Kiera Davis. “She kind of stayed to herself.”
Dozens of community members came to the Canyon Country Park to show their support.
“We’re just here to support. The news came around from friends to friends,” said Felix Garcia. “It s a small Spanish community. We decided why not come over and help. We’re with the Outlaws organization, cheerleading and football. I help (Jimenez-Soto’s aunt) with cooking at the events. We all have kids and we never know when we’ll be next. As a small community, we want to come out and support them and chip in.”
A car wash was held in the parking lot of Pep Boys near Home Depot in Canyon Country, just a couple blocks from where Jimenez-Soto was killed.
Close friends and family washed several cars throughout the day to raise funds for the teen’s funeral.
A close friend of the teen was one of the organizers of the car wash and did not want to comment.
The family plans to host more events to raise money for the teen’s funeral, Garcia said.
Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Homicide Division officials reported the cause of death as “an apparent suicide” and that she was “standing in front of the train when it struck her,” said Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner’s Office.
Jimenez-Soto was struck by a train at 10:20 a.m. Friday, near the corner of Ruether Avenue and Soledad Canyon Road, according to Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station officials.
A memorial was set up next to the train tracks where she was found near Rainbow Glen.
Initial reports indicated Jimenez-Soto’s death might have been accidental, as opposed to a suicide attempt.
Eastbound Soledad Canyon Road at Rainbow Glen was shut down Friday as officials worked around the collision scene.
Homicide Bureau detectives did handling Jimenez-Soto’s case did not immediately respond to a request for a statement.

My husband was the conductor on the train that hit Kimberly. He will never forget that morning for the rest of his life. He is distraught and devastated with the thought that this young girl will never grow up, get married, have children …. experience life. We have a daughter the same age, and can’t imagine the pain her family is feeling. Our hearts go out to Kimberly’s family and friends. You are all in our prayers, continually.

Mitchal Sata of Glendora was killed when he was struck by a Metrolink train traveling east along Glendora Avenue at 48 mph in the evening.
Investigators said it appears Sata had his headphones in listening to music as he was walking along Glendora Avenue. Tracy Aaron Anderson, Sata's mother, said a witness told her the boy may have also been texting at the time.
""She said that he stopped, hesitated for a moment, then when she looked again he was gone,"" Anderson said. ""She was on the other side and I assume that's when he was struck by the train.""
Anderson says her son was a good kid with a big heart.
While she wants everyone to be aware of their surroundings, it's the lack of warning for pedestrians that she says cost her son's his life. There are railroad arms across the road but nothing to stop pedestrians on the sidewalk.
""For him as far as he would be aware, it didn't change, there was nothing different about the path he was on to give an indication he should all of a sudden be aware,"" Anderson said.
Sata's devastated family says that's something they want changed.
""My son was a good kid and he should have had a long life. I just don't want to see this happen again to anybody,"" Anderson said.
Friends continue to gather at the scene, grieving for a young life lost in a tragic accident.

A 68-year-old Walnut Grove man died early Friday after he tried to drive around railroad crossing gates, and a train crashed into his pickup near Galt, the California Highway Patrol reported.The fatal crash was reported about 12:15 a.m. on Spring Street, where the wreckage was found just east of Saddle Crest Circle and west of Highway 99 in Sacramento County.Officers arrived at the scene and found a Chevrolet 2500 pickup lodged in front of a Union Pacific train engine, according to the CHP South Sacramento Area Office.The Walnut Grove man who was driving the pickup suffered fatal injuries in the crash, the CHP said. The Sacramento County Coroner’s Office will release the man’s name once his family has been notified.The train conductor told investigating CHP officers that the train was heading south about 50 mph on the tracks and approaching Twin Cities Road, which is just north of where the train and pickup came to rest after the stop. The conductor spotted the pickup heading west on Twin Cities Road and approaching the crossing gates, which were in the down position with red lights flashing, according to the CHP. He told officers that he watched as the pickup slowed down nearing the crossing as if it was about to stop.But then the pickup’s driver suddenly accelerated and tried to go around the east side of the crossing gates to get over the railroad tracks before the train arrived, the conductor told the CHP.The conductor said he applied the emergency brake, but the engine struck the pickup. CHP officials said the train pushed the Chevrolet over 3,000 feet until they came to a stop just south of the Spring Street crossing.CHP investigators did not know on Friday whether alcohol or drugs were a factor in the fatal crash.“This is a tragic reminder to never cross railroad tracks when the crossing gates are down,” CHP officials said in a Facebook post. “The time you save, most of the time just a few minutes, isn’t worth your life.”

Just before 5:30 Tuesday evening, police and firefighters responded to the railroad crossing on Fruitridge Road just east of Power Inn Road for a reported train versus semi-truck collision.
When authorities arrived, they found a semi-truck with trailer carrying potatoes that had obviously been hit by the freight train that was stopped at the same crossing. The freight train was able to come to a stop nearby.
Fortunately, no one was hurt in the collision, as the freight train only hit the trailer portion of the semi-truck, not affecting the cab portion.
Fruitridge Road was shut down while Sacramento Police and Union Pacific Police conducted their investigation into the cause of the collision, although heavy traffic and a nearby traffic light is suspected to be a factor. Two heavy-duty tow trucks were on standby during the investigation, also trying to figure out how to remove the crushed semi-truck.

A train goes through the intersection of Coloma Road and Folsom Boulevard in Rancho Cordova the day after a teen was struck and killed on the tracks.

Police officers assisted subdued students making their way to school Friday morning at tracks where a young teenager was struck and killed by a light rail train in Rancho Cordova.

The Sacramento County Coroner’s office said the teen killed when hit by the train was 15-year-old Mariah Burgess. Friends interviewed Friday at the tracks that separate the White Rock neighborhood and Folsom Boulevard said she was a freshman at Rancho Cordova High School.

The collision occurred about 2:50 p.m. at Coloma Road and Folsom Boulevard. Alane Masui, spokeswoman for Regional Transit, said witnesses reported that Burgess walked into the path of the eastbound train.

Masui said witness accounts and surveillance video indicated that warning lights were activated and the train operator sounded the horn. She said witnesses reported that the girl appeared to be using headphones and may have been distracted.

The teen was walking across tracks that run parallel to Folsom Boulevard at Coloma Road. A wall with an arched gateway allows pedestrians to walk between the White Rock residential neighborhood and businesses along Folsom Boulevard and the nearby high school and Mills Jr. High.

But first, pedestrians must cross freight tracks and two sets of light rail tracks leading from Folsom to Sacramento. Bells clang, lights flash and the sidewalk is clearly marked to alert those crossing the tracks to beware of oncoming trains.

Sacramento police officers greeted students Friday morning as they quietly made their way to school at the crossing. One boy leaned down to place a candle at the impromptu shrine erected to memorialize the death of Burgess while others spoke admiringly of the teen.

“She was just a nice person,” said 11-year-old Tatianna Franklin. “She was always encouraging, easy to talk to.”

“She had a bright future,” said 13-year-old Julianna Claypool. “She wanted to go far.”

The girls said that Burgess was sports oriented and tried out for different school teams.

Deneisha Huey walked her daughter, Jakailah Columbus, a Cordova freshman who knew Burgess, across the tracks on Friday because she was uncomfortable after the death of the teen.

“I tell my daughter to pay attention,” she said. “Watch for the red lights. Stay alert. Pay attention to your surroundings.”

One woman who lives nearby, Linda Elizondo, said that it would be good to have a crossing guard at the site.

A mother’s cries in the darkness couldn’t drown out the haunting sound of the Regional Transit warning bells that should have alerted her daughter a deadly threat was near.

“I hate them for hitting my baby,” Amanda Burgess said through tears as she talked about her 15-year-old daughter, Mariah.

More than one hundred people gathered in Rancho Cordova to hold up a bright light for the even brighter one they say was snuffed out during a walk home from Cordova High School.

One of seven children, Mariah, was walking with her twin Myia and their other siblings when she was hit at Folsom Boulevard and Coloma Road by a light rail train servicing the Gold Line.

“We just saw her. We were just talking with her,” said Angela Byron, the mother of one of Mariah’s friends from school.

Regional Transit investigators say the train operator hit the brakes but wasn’t able to stop before impact.

They tell FOX40 video surveillance in the area shows Mariah walking into the path of that train despite the blaring horn sounded by the operator.

There are reports she was wearing earbuds or earmuffs.

With hearts so broken and emotions running so high, it’s not a scenario sitting well with her family,

“I want to see the tape RT. I want to see the tape, want to see proof why she’s dead right now. He hit her so hard they severed my daughter out here on the tracks. They severed her,” Mariah’s father Dwayne Burgess cried to the crowd.

Their need to be where Mariah left them, left the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department and RT warning her loved ones that remembrance wasn’t worth the risk of another life.

A helicopter blasted down voice encouragements for the mourners to move off the tracks.

As for Mariah, everyone at the memorial is convinced they know where that life, that light has gone.

The faithful teen was just asking all about heaven in bible study on Tuesday.

“God you do not make mistakes and you use everything to show your glory. We’re asking Father God for you to show your glory in this situation,” prayed her pastor Raymond Bradley.

Regional Transit procedure following an incident like this is to have the operator undergo alcohol and drug tests and for them to be placed on administrative leave.

Video of the accident was recorded from inside the train and will be reviewed as part of the investigation.

An 11-year-old girl was killed and her mother was left critically injured after being struck by a train in Redlands on Tuesday night.

The fatal collision happened on the railroad tracks at Alabama Street, just north of Redlands Boulevard shortly before 8:30 p.m., according to the Redlands Police Department.

The Metrolink train was traveling at about 50 mph when the engineer spotted the victims’ vehicle on the train tracks, police said. The engineer applied the brakes but was unable to stop in time before crashing head-on into the victims’ car.

The child was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. The mother, who was sitting in the driver’s seat, was taken to the hospital with critical injuries.

Images from the scene show the victims’ car completely mangled and destroyed at the busy intersection. Debris from the crash was strewn across the tracks and nearby roadway.

The victims were headed northbound when they ended up on the tracks for some unknown reason, police said. Moments later, a Metrolink train traveling westbound struck the vehicle.

There were four people aboard the train at the time — two passengers, an engineer and the conductor, said Metrolink. One passenger was taken to the hospital with a “complaint of pain,” officials said.

Locals say the intersection where the crash took place is a dangerous one.

“It’s very busy and there are often people who don’t stop when they’re supposed to at the intersection,” said Nicolas, who commutes to Redlands for work. “They stop in the middle of the intersection because there’s just so many cars lined up, so I can see an accident happening pretty easily.”

“We just heard a loud bang,” said Saalim Scott, a man who worked nearby and heard the crash. “I thought it was something falling off the truck. We all came out and we saw the car and somebody off to the side. It’s just pretty sad, honestly, because life is short. You want to hold your family a little closer.”

“I got in my car and I came right here and that’s when I realized the car was hit by the train,” said resident Victor Medford. “It hurts. It hurts bad. Last night when I saw it, I cried.”

Police are still investigating how the vehicle ended up on the tracks in the first place.

“The initial investigation indicated that all safety gates and signals were working properly and there were no signs of drugs or alcohol in the driver’s system,” police said.

The crash happened in a quiet zone where train horns do not sound off at crossings unless it’s an emergency situation. It’s unclear whether the Metrolink train’s horn went off before the deadly collision.

The mother remains hospitalized in critical condition. No identities have been released by authorities.

Two people are in critical condition after crashing into a Metrolink train in San Bernardino on Wednesday.

The collision happened on Rancho Avenue as the victims drove their pickup truck across the railroad tracks, according to the San Bernardino Police Department.

Over 30 passengers were aboard the train during the crash, police said.

Images from the scene show the crash left the truck in a mangled mess, sending debris strewn across the railroad.

Officers say the truck driver was traveling eastbound towards the tracks at an “unsafe speed.”

The driver “failed to stop for the guard crossing arm and collided into the Metrolink train which was traveling Eastbound,” authorities said.

Just after midnight, a man tried to crawl between the cars of a freight train after it had stopped on the tracks near the convention center. As he tried to do so, police say, the train began to move, severing the man's leg below the shin.

Several videos have gone viral in recent months that show impatient pedestrians climbing on and under trains to get from Harbor Drive to the Gaslamp.

A few months ago, another victim lost her leg at 5th and Harbor while trying to crawl between rail cars.

""These freight trains come through the area,"" SDPD Lt. Anthony Reese said. ""They periodically just stop and pedestrians get a little frustrated not being able to cross because you can't cross while the trains are there stopped, so they take it [upon] themselves just to cross, and, unfortunately, some of them don't make it before the train starts, and they get stuck or they fall and, you know, they succumb to these injuries.""

Police are urging people to obey the flashing lights and wait for the train to pass, or to use the pedestrian bridge.

The victim from this latest incident was rushed to the UC San Diego Medical Center. It's not known if surgeons were able to reattach the limb.

Courtesy Onscene.Media

At least one person was struck and injured in downtown San Diego Monday night when a group of people tried to cross the tracks.

According to police, a group of people became impatient after a train was sitting on the tracks and blocking access to 5th Avenue across the street from the Convention Center and decided to climb over and under the train.

“The trolley arms were down, it was a slow moving train and people… didn’t want to wait for the train,” San Diego police Lt. Anthony Reese told Onscene.Media.

The engineer had no idea that the BNS&F train had struck anybody and thus did not stop, he said. First responders found one person on the tracks.

“One female tried to cross and either got slipped and fell or got stuck underneath the train, and her right leg got run over,” Reese said, adding that her leg may have to be amputated.

The incident happened on East Harbor Drive near the convention center as people left the Rady Shell after a concert.

San Diego police say a woman and several others were trying to crawl around a stopped train when the train moved, causing several people to fall.

The woman fell under the train and was run over, and her leg had to be amputated.

On Tuesday, people who work downtown told ABC 10News that they regularly see the freight trains blocking intersections and crosswalks.

They say people get impatient and start crawling through the train cars or going around them.

""I see people running through that all the time, I see people going around, so if the train is almost to the end to go around it, they'll go around it, I see. People jumping through sometimes, on bikes sometimes like quickly going around it,"" said Rhiawna Samudio, who works nearby.

Pedicab drivers in the area say they see the same issue with people climbing on and through the trains when they're stationary.

""It takes about 20 to 25 minutes, sometimes even longer, so people get desperate, and they start crossing the train,"" said Maycl Soto, a pedicab driver who regularly works downtown.

The fatal incident occurred last Friday when Segal, on a bicycle, crossed the train tracks and was struck by an oncoming train.

“After the northbound train passed through, a 17-year-old boy crossed the tracks on his bike, not realizing there was also a passing southbound train,” the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said.

The two other teens were not hurt.

Alex attended Torrey Pines High School and according to the school's website, was a member of the boy's junior varsity soccer team.

In an email to Torrey Pines families, principal Rob Coppo said:

“I know we are all deeply saddened by this loss, and we send our condolences to the student’s family and friends.

According to multiple reports, a 17-year old boy was killed when he was struck by an Amtrak train in San Diego’s University City neighborhood early Friday afternoon.
The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was crossing the railroad tracks on Sorrento Valley Blvd, between Sorrento Valley Road and Roselle Street, when he was hit by the southbound Amtrak Pacific Surfliner at 12:34 pm.
He died at the scene.
The victim was one of three boys who stopped their bikes at the railroad crossing gates to wait for a northbound train to pass. But as so often happens, he rode around the gates after that train had passed, not realizing another train was coming in the opposite direction.
Tragically, Fox5 reports that the victim’s parents arrived shortly after the crash, while officials were still removing his mangled bike from the tracks.
The other two boys were not injured. It’s not clear if they were riding with the victim, or just happened to stop together at the gates.
This is yet another tragic reminder to always wait until the gates go up to cross any rail tracks, regardless of whether it seems safe at the time.
Anyone with information is urged to call the Sheriff’s Department’s non-emergency line at 858/565-5200.
This is at least the 24th bicycling fatality in Southern California this year, and the seventh that I’m aware of in San Diego County.
Update: The victim has been identified 17-year old Alex Segal. He was a student at Torrey Pines High School in the Del Mar Heights neighborhood, and a member of the junior varsity soccer team.
My deepest sympathy and prayers for Alex Segal and all his family and loved ones.
Thanks to Phillip Young for the heads-up.

A 17-year-old is dead after being hit by a train. San Diego Police Lieutenant Jake Resch said police were called before 1 p.m. Friday to a fatality at the Sorrento Valley Boulevard grade crossing.

San Diego County Sheriff's Transit Enforcement Unit investigates incidents along the routes of the North County Transit District District which Amtrak uses.

The collision happened at approximately 12:34 pm. When San Diego Police and Fire arrived, they found a male bicyclist who had been hit by a southbound Amtrak train. The male did not survive his injuries.

The Medical Examiner's Office will make a positive identification of the male and also determine the cause and manner of death, pending notification of his family.

All services operating in the San Diego (OLT) area were experiencing lengthy delays throughout Friday afternoon, according to a Pacific Surfliner.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene, Lopez said.

Some Metrolink train service to Orange County and Los Angeles was affected by the accident.

The train, operated by the North County Transit District, had no passengers aboard and was headed north to a maintenance yard, an official said.

A pedestrian who was standing on the tracks as a southbound Amtrak train approached him was struck and killed Sunday in Oceanside, authorities are reporting.

The deadly collision was reported shortly after 2:30 p.m. on the railroad track crossing located at 250 Cassidy Street, according to Deputy G. Pantoja of the sheriff’s department.

The train was traveling approximately 50-60 mph when the locomotive’s operator spotted the pedestrian standing on the tracks, Pantoja said.

The train went into emergency braking “but was unable to stop in time and fatally struck the male,” the deputy continued.

The victim’s identity has not been released.

DEL MAR (CBS 8/CNS) - A southbound Coaster commuter train hit a vehicle Saturday afternoon in Del Mar, causing serious injuries to one victim who was hospitalized, according to officials.

 

An SUV containing two people in the area where 15th Street crosses the tracks was hit, according to San Diego County sheriff's officials.

 

A woman driving an SUV was attempting to make a U-turn at the train crossing near Coast Boulevard when the crossing arm came down. When she tried to turn around, she got clipped by the train and hit a pedestrian, trapping the victim under the vehicle, according to San Diego County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Schaller.

The pedestrian suffered major injuries and was transported to Scripps La Jolla for evaluation.

About seven deputies responded to the tracks where the Coaster train came to a stop in the area near Ocean Avenue just before 2:30 p.m., Schaller

said.

 

There were apparently two witnesses to the collision, and deputies requested a Farsi translator to respond to the scene, Schaller said.

The accident was reported just after 9:30 a.m. at Pacific Highway and Washington Street in the uptown San Diego area. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department told NBC 7 no injuries were reported.

Traffic was shut down and diverted in the area, officials said. Amtrak service was temporarily shut down in both directions as well.

Officers from the San Diego Police Department, San Diego Fire-Rescue Department (SDFD) crews and officials from the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) all responded to the scene.

The collision caused the box truck to also smash into a fence that runs along the train tracks. The box truck plowed through a cross pole and traffic sign, which wound up wedged between the truck and fence. The truck subsequently struck three other vehicles.

The traffic sign also hit an MTS vehicle parked on the other side of the fence, damaging a window.

NBC 7 spoke with Natalie Fernbaugh, a passenger on the Amtrak train bound for Los Angeles.

She said she was listening to music when, suddenly, the train came to a halt.

“It stopped really abruptly. We were just all kind of confused,” she explained. ""It kind of shook.""

Fernbaugh said she and other passengers waited in their seats for 15 minutes or so, until they heard an announcement on the speaker from Amtrak staff. They were notified of the accident, and the subsequent delay of their train trip.

Witness Jasmine Pablo was riding in a car with a friend near the tracks, waiting at a red light behind a line of other cars.

She said it looked like the box truck – at the front of the line – got stuck on the tracks and the oncoming train was unable to avoid hitting it.

The man, who was between 20 and 30 years old, was cut into pieces by the northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train, which was travelling about 10mph (16km/h) at the time and was 62 cars long, Detective Ed Macken from San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said.

“He was be-bopping back and forth and there might have been phones up recording,” Macken said. “He was trying to do a manoeuvre to shoot under a train and it didn’t work.”

The train finally came to a stop about 35 miles (56km) north of the fatal incident.

Macken said the crossing gates were down and warning lights were flashing when the accident happened.

The death highlighted an ongoing problem with open, very visible and accessible train corridors in San Diego County, Macken said.

“We’ve had 22 train suicides and accidents in the last year-and-a-half,” he said. “We don’t think this one was a suicide, but they all make a big mess.”

Passenger and freight trains in both directions were stopped for hours while deputies tried to gather evidence and find witnesses.

“We’re still looking for witnesses,” Macken said. “What we know was he was crouched down, bobbing back and forth and then he went for it.

ENCINITAS (CNS) - Authorities Sunday publicly identified the tow truck driver who was struck and killed by an Amtrak train at a railroad crossing in Cardiff-by-the-Sea.

Shaun William Riddle, 27, was attempting to hook a vehicle stalled at Chesterfield Drive and South Coast Highway 101 to the flatbed tow truck about 2:35 p.m. Saturday, according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office.

Riddle was apparently assisting the owner of a broken-down SUV just west of the tracks, sheriff's officials said.

A southbound Surfliner train approached the intersection and Riddle got back into the truck to move it out of the train's path, but could not do so, the Medical Examiner's Office reported.

The train was traveling at a high rate of speed when it struck the tow truck, which reportedly was between closed crossing arms, authorities said. The rig was demolished.

Riddle died at the scene, the Medical Examiner's Office said.

The southbound train stopped at the Solana Beach station, where several of the 125 passengers aboard were treated for minor injuries.

 The crash happened around 2:35 p.m. at Chesterfield Drive and South Coast Highway 101.

 

 According to Encinitas deputies, the driver of the tow truck had stopped on the railroad tracks to assist a disabled SUV that was stalled just west of the tracks.

 

 A short time later, an Amtrak train approached. The tow truck was unable to move in time and was struck by the train. 

 

 The driver of the tow truck sustained fatal injuries and died at the scene, deputies said.

 

 The crash is under investigation

 

 At 3:35 p.m., North County Transit took to their Twitter page to also confirm the collision, tweeting: ""Due to an incident on the tracks involving Amtrak, COASTER may experience a delay.""

 

 One local witness said he saw the SUV on the flatbed tow truck, both stalled on the tracks. The witness said the train crossing arm dropped on the SUV and a moment later, the train slammed into the tow truck.

The witness caught the entire crash on tape. The video shows the truck driver’s door closing and then the truck turning away from the train just moments before the collision.

A witness who works across the street from the train tracks said the sound of the fatal crash was horrific.

“It's somewhere between an explosion and thunder. You know, when metal hits metal it makes a noise unto itself,” explained witness Thomas Neely.

The white SUV was left in place at the intersection.

Moments after the crash, people nearby tried to help and scrambled to find survivors.

One witness said the driver was ejected from his tow truck and thrown some 100 yards from the crash site. On the witness video, people seemed to cover the body of the victim while waiting for emergency crews to arrive.

“Anybody else back there?” a person searching for survivors at the crash site says on the video.

 

 Another resident who lives near the site of the crash told NBC 7 that the impact from the collision shook his whole house.

 

 It’s unclear how fast the train was traveling at impact, but the southbound Amtrak train came to a stop about half a mile away from the Chesterfield Drive crossing.

 

 Pieces of the tow truck were strewn around the train tracks for hundreds of yards after the crash, including the flatbed, a wheel and even the massive engine block that landed about 200 yards away.

 

 Numerous workers from the company TOWEX later arrived at the scene. The towing company responds to AAA calls.

 

 The company told NBC 7 it wants to respect the privacy of the victim’s family, so his name was not released. One source confirmed the man had a wife and young daughter.

The Medical Examiner’s office will identify the victim at a later time.

 

 Most people nearby were saddened to hear that a man lost his life in the crash on the train tracks, including Neely.

 

 “I'm sorry to hear that a mother lost her son, especially during the holidays. There's never a good time but it's just, it's tragic,” said Neely.

 

 The two women who drove the SUV were not injured.

Officers investigating the death say Christopher Brian Roberts, 29, appeared to have been either on his way to work or just returning from work.

Roberts was found with the earphone wrapped around his neck according to a police spokesperson.

The accident happened directly across from the NASSCO Shipyard but there are several other businesses in the area including restaurants and auto repair shops.

There were no witnesses to the accident but officers said Roberts had to walk around the crossing arm to attempt to cross the tracks.

The first incident was a train vs. pedestrian collision, about 1:45 p.m., near the Highway 120 and McHenry Avenue railroad crossing. The victim was identified as Paul Lopez, 63, of Escalon and authorities said he was struck by an Amtrak train. There was also a freight train in the area, apparently stopped on the tracks, and eyewitnesses said the man appeared to walk around the downed crossing arms to get past the freight train when he was struck. The investigation is continuing, taken over by Amtrak Police.

A couple hours later, just after 4 p.m., an Escalon woman died as a result of injuries sustained when the SUV she was driving collided with a hay squeeze along Highway 120 near Sexton Road. She was identified as Glenda Mancilla Larios, 38, of Escalon. The crash also resulted in major injuries to the driver of the farm equipment – with a lengthy extrication required – and authorities said there were minor passengers in the SUV who were injured and taken to area hospitals. No information was available on their condition. That accident also remains under investigation, being handled by the CHP.

Assisting with the incidents were Escalon Police, Escalon Community Ambulance and Escalon Fire Department personnel, with additional support from Escalon Public Works and Escalon Unified School District personnel at the train/pedestrian collision.

SPECIFICALLY, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR MAP, WE ARE ALL IN THE GREEN. WE DO HAVE SOMETHING IN ORANGE VALE THAT MELANIE WINGO WILL DETAIL IN A MOMENT, BUT NOT AFFECTING ANY TRAFFIC. SO THAT’S GREAT. DOWN ON I-5 SOUTHBOUND, SOUTH OF STOCKTON, EVEN THERE, THERE WAS A WRECK EARLIER. THERE ARE PIECES OF THOSE CARS IN THE ROADWAY AND THEY ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM THAT WRECK. MINOR INJURY, WRECK. ALSO SOMETHING HAPPENING IN COPPEROPOLIS JUST POPPED UP ON THE MAP. I KNOW IT’S REMOTE, BUT A CAR DROVE THROUGH 250FT OF FENCE LINE AND ALL OF THAT’S IN THE ROADWAY. IF YOU’RE COPPEROPOLIS VIEWER THAT IS HAPPENING, PLEASE BE AWARE. OTHER THAN THAT, TRACY TRIANGLE IS REALLY OUR ONLY PAIN POINT THIS MORNING IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC.

YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE STORY HE DID ON ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY INSIDE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. IT IS PRETTY AWESOME. IT’S KIND OF A GAME CHANGER, SO IT’S NEAT. YEAH. WE’LL JOIN BRIAN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES. THE MEANTIME, RIGHT NOW, PART OF A MAJOR STREET IN ORANGEVILLE HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF BECAUSE OF A VEHICLE THAT CRASHED INTO A UTILITY POLE. THIS WAS ON GREENBACK LANE NEAR HAZEL AVENUE. CREWS GOT THE CALL THERE AROUND 2 A.M. OUR MELANIE WINGO JOINS US LIVE WITH THE WORK THAT’S UNDERWAY. AND IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE THEY HAVE OPENED IT. MELANIE OKAY, SO JUST WITHIN THE LAST TWO MINUTES SINCE WE SAW YOU RIGHT AT THE TOP OF OUR 6 A.M. NEWSCAST, THEY HAVE MOVED IN. THE BIG GUNS, THE BIG TRUCKS FOR SMUD, AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN A NEW POWER POLE THAT WE EXPECT WILL BE REPLACING THIS ONE THAT IS NOW LEANING OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SO WE SEE BIGGER SMUD VEHICLES EVEN THAN WE SAW IN OUR LAST HALF HOUR. NOW IN PLACE STAGING READY TO BEGIN WORK ON THIS POWER POLE THAT WAS HIT BY A CAR OVERNIGHT. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF PHOTOGRAPHS THAT A VIEWER SENT US A SHORT TIME AGO, THAT THIS IS HOW THINGS LOOKED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT CAR CRASHED INTO THE POWER POLE, RIGHT NOW, IT’S NOT KNOWN WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH OR HOW THE DRIVER IS DOING. ACCORDING TO CHP, THAT’S ALL UNDER INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW, BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED, THE CAR WAS JUST BEING TOWED AWAY AND CHP OFFICERS AT THE SCENE SAID THIS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE MORNING COMMUTE OUT HERE AT GREENBACK LANE, RIGHT AT BRAZIL, WHERE WE’RE JUST WEST OF HAZEL AVENUE, RIGHT IN THE ORANGEVILLE AREA. IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PART OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY, RESTORING POWER TO THE 25 CUSTOMERS AFFECTED IS THE GOAL. ALSO MAKING SURE THIS KEY PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS SAFE BECAUSE AS WE’RE LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE STABLE WHATSOEVER. SO THEY’VE GOT THE LINES DE-ENERGIZED THE CREWS OUT HERE AND JUST JUST AGAIN WITHIN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES OR SO, THEY HAVE REALLY PUT THESE BIGGER VEHICLES INTO POSITION AND IT APPEARS THEY’RE MAKING SOME PRETTY QUICK WORK OF GETTING RIGHT TO IT. THOSE CREWS WERE OUT HERE ASSESSING FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND NOW THEY ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THEY GOT ALL THE MACHINERY OUT AND READY TO GO, AND WE’RE GOING TO SEE THEIR PROGRESS OUT HERE AS THEY MAKE IT TO TRY TO GET THIS POLE PUT UP. SO WE’LL REPORT BACK IN JUST A BIT WITH THEIR PROGRESS. ALL RIGHT. BACK TO YOU IN THE STUDIO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IN THE MEANTIME, AN ACCUSED SERIAL KILLER DUE TO BE BACK IN COURT THIS MORNING IN STOCKTON. HERE’S SOME VIDEO NOW OF WESLEY BROWNLEE FROM A COURT APPEARANCE EARLIER THIS YEAR. HE’S ACCUSED OF KILLING SEVEN PEOPLE OVER 18 MONTHS. FIVE OF THEM HAPPEN IN STOCKTON. TWO OCCURRED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. BROWNLEE IS ALSO ACCUSED OF THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF AN EIGHTH PERSON WHO WAS SHOT, BUT SURVIVED. TODAY’S HEARING IS A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY. SO THAT MEANS EITHER HIS DEFENSE TEAM WILL ASK PROSECUTORS TO TURN OVER EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, OR PROSECUTORS WILL ASK THE DEFENSE FOR INFORMATION IN THEIR CASE. A 606 NOW. NOW TO MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE A HELICOPTER ACCIDENT KILLED IRAN’S PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER. MIKE CHERRY IS JOINING US NOW WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AND ALSO WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. YEAH. SO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO. IT JUST SHOWS THE HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS THAT FIRST RESPONDERS WERE DEALING WITH WHEN THEY TRIED TO HEAD TO THAT CRASH SITE. OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT RESTRICTED VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE POOR WEATHER IS WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH. IRAN’S PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER WERE RETURNING FROM A COMMEMORATION EVENT WHEN THE CRASH TOOK PLACE, KILLING EIGHT PEOPLE IN ALL. THIS COMES DURING A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. IRAN ARMS RUSSIA IN ITS WAR AGAINST UKRAINE, AND THEN IT ALSO ATTACKED ISRAEL AMID ITS ONGOING WAR AGAINST HAMAS. NOW THE PRESIDENT POSITION IN IRAN IS SEEN AS A SECOND IN COMMAND BEHIND THE SUPREME LEADER. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS THE TOP ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THAT COUNTRY. STILL, OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL IN THE COUNTRY. EARLIER THIS MORNING, IRAN’S CABINET ANNOUNCED THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT IS TAKING OVER THE POSITION UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAPPENS WITHIN THE NEXT 50 DAYS. TAHOE. ALL RIGHT, MIKE, THANK YOU. WELL, THIS MORNING, A MAN IS IN JAIL ACCUSED OF MOLESTING A FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL THAT VICTIM IS NOW A TEENAGER AND REPORTED IT TO HER FAMILY. NOW, THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE MORE VICTIMS. KCRA 3’S LETICIA ORDAZ LIVE NOW IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WITH MORE ON WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS YOUR HELP. DURANTE OH GOOD MORNING. THIS IS A VERY DISTURBING CASE IN OUR REGION. THAT MAN IS NOW AT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY JAIL WHERE HE CAN’T HURT ANYONE. BUT ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, HE WAS A KARATE INSTRUCTOR IN TOWN. HE WAS ALSO A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER, SO HE HAD ACCESS TO A LOT OF KIDS. THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE COULD BE MORE VICTIMS WHO SIMPLY HAVEN’T COME FORWARD YET. SO THIS IS HOW THIS STORY UNFOLDED. ON FRIDAY, A WOMAN CALLED THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE TO REPORT HER TEENAGE DAUGHTER WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED WHEN SHE WAS JUST FOUR YEARS OLD BY A FAMILY FRIEND. DETECTIVES ENDED UP ARRESTING THE SUSPECT, 49 YEAR OLD JASON PRATER, AFTER THEY SAY HE MADE SOME ADMISSIONS AND CONFIRMED SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF THE GIRL’S STATEMENT. DEPUTIES SAY BEFORE HIS ARREST ON FRIDAY, PRATER WORKED AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER AT JOHN ADAMS ACADEMY IN ROSEVILLE, AND DEPUTIES TELL US PRATER PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT OPTIONS FOR YOUTH CHARTER SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO UNTIL LAST AUGUST. PRATER WAS ALSO A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR IN THE SACRAMENTO AND ROSEVILLE AREAS, AND INVESTIGATORS WANT FAMILIES TO COME FORWARD IF THEY SUSPECT THEIR CHILD COULD BE A VICTIM, COME FORWARD, BRING THIS INFORMATION TO US. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AGAIN, ANYTHING THAT HE’S BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR, HE’S HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR. AND AGAIN, I DON’T CARE IF IT HAPPENED 20 YEARS AGO, 30 YEARS AGO. DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT. PLEASE BRING THAT INFORMATION. ANY LITTLE TIDBIT CAN HELP US AGAIN. KEEP HIM LOCKED AWAY. OUR BIGGEST THING RIGHT NOW, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN’T VICTIMIZE ANYONE ELSE. AND PRATER WILL FACE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SACRAMENTO. HE FACES TWO COUNTS OF CHILD MOLESTATION, AND RIGHT NOW, HIS BAIL HAS BEEN SET. AT $2.1 MILLION. REPORTING LIVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY, LETICIA ORDAZ KCRA THREE NEWS. ALL RIGHT, LETICIA, THANK YOU. 609 NOW, WE DID REACH OUT TO JOHN ADAMS ACADEMY IN ROSEVILLE TO COMMENT ON THE ARREST OF THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. AT THIS POINT, NO WORD BACK. WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED. HOWEVER, WE GOT A LIVE SKYCAM VIEW HERE OVER THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER IN SACRAMENTO STATE WRAPPING UP THREE DAYS OF GRADUATION CEREMONIES OVER THE WEEKEND. NOW IT’S TIME FOR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. THE ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BEGINS THREE STRAIGHT DAYS OF GRADUATIONS FOR ITS NINE SCHOOLS. IT BEGINS AT 11:00 THIS MORNING WITH MONTEREY TRAIL. THEN AT THREE, IT’S LAGUNA CREEK, AND AT SEVEN ELK GROVE HIGH SCHOOL. SENIORS WILL WALK THE STAGE AND AFTER ELK GROVE GRADUATIONS WRAP UP NATOMAS UNIFIED HOLD THEIR CEREMONIES HERE. THURSDAY. IT IS 6:10 NOW, AS WE DO KCRA THREE WEATHER AND TRAFFIC. EVERY TEN MINUTES WE REJOIN TAMARA WITH A HEADS UP ABOUT THE NORTH WIND TODAY. YEAH, YOU KNOW, IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH ALLERGIES, WHICH I KNOW THIS IS A PRIME TIME OF YEAR WHERE THINGS ARE GETTING PASSED AROUND IN TERMS OF THE POLLEN, THAT NORTH WIND IS JUST GOING TO STIR THINGS BACK UP OUT THE DOOR THIS MORNING THERE IN SUTTER HEALTH PARK. PRETTY CALM START TO THE DAY. WE’RE IN THE LOW 50S IN THE VALLEY AND 32 UP AT THE TOP THERE IN LAKE TAHOE AND AROUND TRUCKEE. NOW HERE IS THAT NORTH WIND TIMELINE GIVES YOU A GOOD VISUAL. SO THE WINDS AS YOU STEP OUT THE DOOR THIS MORNING, THEY’RE NOT THAT STRONG, BUT THEY’RE GOING TO INCREASE A BIT MORE AS WE GET BEYOND ABOUT MIDDAY. AND ON INTO THE HEART OF THE AFTERNOON.

TRACY - A driver died after officials said he drove through crossing arms and was hit by an oncoming train in the Tracy area on Friday morning. The CHP responded to the collision around 8 a.m. near S. Chrisman Road south of Bates Road. They said 68 passengers were on board an ACE commuter train that was traveling west at about 70 mph and was approaching S. Chrisman Road. At the same time, a 58-year-old man was driving a 2004 Honda SUV north at an unknown speed. CHP officers said the crossing arms were in the down position when the man drove through crossing arms, directly in the path of the train. The train struck the passenger side of the vehicle, causing major damage to the train and SUV.


The Honda driver, a man from Tracy, died at the scene. He has not been identified at this time. Anyone with information is urged to contact the CHP - Tracy office.

A California police officer pulled a man out of his wheelchair and to safety on Wednesday, moments before he would have been crushed by an oncoming train, dramatic video of the rescue showed.

Lodi police officer Erika Urrea and Sgt. Steve Maynard were on patrol in their Central Valley community when they spotted the 66-year-old man in his wheelchair, stuck on tracks as crossing guards were coming down and a train approached at 8:44 a.m. PT, officials said.

Urrea was driving and she barely caught sight the prone pedestrian out of the corner of her eye.

""So I happen to kind of look to the side and notice there was a man in a wheelchair, and he seemed to be almost wiggling, like he was stuck,"" Urrea told ""NBC Nightly News"" on Thursday.

Urrea's body camera captured the life-and-death seconds, as she sprinted from her squad car to the pedestrian, stuck on Lodi Avenue.

""Can you get up?"" Urrea can be heard frantically asking on the bodycam video.

She unbuckled him, grabbed his torso and pulled him up out of the chair.

""Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!"" Urrea screamed n the video while the Union Pacific train fast approached and she pulled him away.

Urrea and the man fell to ground as the train smashed through his wheelchair feet away.

""I need an ambulance now!"" Urrea yelled out, with the sound of the train still speeding past.

Erika Urrea. Lodi police department

As these terrifying seconds unfolded, Urrea said she didn't have enough time to become afraid. But 24 hours later, the veteran police officer admitted the video was hard to watch.

""I was trying to figure out 'OK, where's the train? I don't know how fast the train is going. How much time do I have?' But my goal was, 'I need to get him off the tracks,'"" Urrea said.

""Honestly, it seems like I'm watching someone else's video. It's very surreal ... it was scary to watch.""

The man was taken to the hospital and he was in stable condition on Thursday.

""As the incident happened very quickly we believe the chair wheel was stuck in the groove between the railroad track and the cement,"" Lodi police Lt. Michael Manetti said.

The 36-year-old single mom, who has beenon the job for 14 years, said — unsurprisingly — there's no training for dealing with a speeding train.

""No, nothing this specific at least,"" Urrea laughed, adding that she'll never forget Wednesday's rescue. ""The most memorable ... probably the scariest incident that I've been involved with so far.""

The officer's supervisors hailed her quick thinking and decisive action.

“We are very proud of Officer Urrea and her heroic actions,"" Lodi police Capt. David Griffin said in a statement on Thursday. ""Thanks to her awareness and quick action she was able to save the man’s life at great personal risk to herself. This is another shining example of the brave actions the men and women of law enforcement exhibit every day.”

The video has been viewed millions of times across the world since Lodi police first published it on their YouTube page late Wednesday afternoon.

Former pro basketball player Rex Chapman, a prolific social media scraper who can make video go viral just by sharing it with his 918,000 followers, posted the clip on Wednesday night. And on his feed alone, it took just 17 hours for Lodi clip to reach a million views.

""Oh. My. God,"" Chapman wrote, summing up the video's content.

A Sacramento TV news anchor, with just 4,500 followers, also had a million views of the video in about the same time frame as Chapman's post.

Urrea shrugged off being called a hero and insisted anyone in her position would have acted as she did.

""I honestly don't think I did anything special. I know all the people that I work with would have done the same thing,"" the officer said Thursday.

""I just did what I felt that anybody in my situation would have done and something that I felt like, if that was my family member or friend that was stuck, I would want someone to come out and help.""

Caltrain switched to single-tracking, and another southbound train picked the passengers up from the Broadway station soon after. Train delays of half an hour or less continued into the afternoon, he said. Police directed car traffic past the crossing, which was blocked off while it was being cleared. “Sometimes it can be far worse,” White said, noting that there were no injuries. Store manager Fabiana Pires was working at Maverick Jack’s when she thought she had heard something falling in the kitchen. It turned out to be the sound of the train hitting the truck. It looked like the train had struck the back of the truck, which then clipped an SUV, she said. First responders on the scene did not want to comment, though Pires said the driver of the SUV had no injuries but was taken away in an ambulance. “It was a scary scene,” said John Kevranian, co-owner of Nuts for Candy & Toys on Broadway and president of the Broadway Burlingame Business Improvement District. He heard sirens, and walked to the intersection about 10 minutes after the crash. When he saw the train stopped on the tracks, he thought a car or pedestrian had been hit. “There were ambulances, there were fire trucks, all kinds of emergency people there,” he said. A crossing arm, the bar that comes down between traffic and the tracks when a train comes by, was damaged. A crew from Caltrain was working on it when the truck pulled away from the crossing and parked around the corner more than an hour after being struck. The Broadway crossing has a reputation for being dangerous. There has been a push for “grade separation,” turning the crossing into an underpass to let trains pass over traffic instead of through it. The project will cost an estimated $316 million. “We have to get this project funded, we have to start this project as soon as possible,” Kevranian said. “We have seen accidents, we have seen death, we have seen catastrophe at this location.”",Caltrain,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Caltrain,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,11,28,2023,12,PM,Broadway,Unknown,San Mateo,CA,6,Burlingame,Broadway,Public,B,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,3,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,A,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,8,Unknown,3,Unknown,1,Unknown,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,0,0,67,1,Unknown,0,0,No,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

In the hours following the accident, the area around Hayward Park station became a focal point of investigation and recovery efforts. Caltrain officials and local authorities worked together to understand the circumstances leading to this tragic event. The station’s northbound platform was temporarily closed, and trains were rerouted to the southbound platform, highlighting the operational challenges such incidents pose to public transportation systems.
Legal Implications
The tragic incident at the Hayward Park station in San Mateo brings to light significant legal implications, particularly in the realm of public transportation safety and pedestrian rights. In such cases, the investigation focuses on determining the cause of the accident and whether any negligence or breach of safety protocols contributed to the tragedy. This could involve examining train operation procedures, signal systems, and the actions of the train operator and the victim at the time of the incident.
Nationally, pedestrian accidents involving trains are a concerning issue. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, there were over 2,000 railway-related accidents in the United States in 2021, many involving pedestrians at crossings and along tracks. These statistics highlight the ongoing need for stringent safety measures and public awareness campaigns to prevent such accidents.
For victims and their families, navigating the aftermath of a train-related accident can be complex and emotionally taxing. This is where the expertise of a personal injury attorney becomes invaluable. A skilled train accident attorney can provide guidance on the legal options available, help in dealing with insurance claims, and ensure that the victim’s rights are protected. In cases like the San Mateo Caltrain incident, legal representation is crucial in seeking justice and compensation for the losses incurred.
The heartrending incident at San Mateo’s Hayward Park station is a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of accidents and the profound impact they can have on individuals and communities. It underscores the vital importance of legal representation in the aftermath of such tragedies. In cases involving public transportation accidents, the role of a specialized attorney, such as a train accident lawyer or a San Francisco personal injury attorney, becomes crucial.

The driver of the vehicle was taken to a hospital but none of the 36 passengers on the train reported any injuries.

The passengers on train No. 501 were stuck on board for hours while crews worked to remove the wreckage of the vehicle and make repairs to the train's front-end plow, White said.

The train was eventually able to be moved to the Broadway station by about 9 a.m. to transfer the passengers and regular Caltrain service was resuming. Bus shuttles from SamTrans assisted to take other passengers along the Caltrain system during the disruption, according to White.

The condition of the vehicle driver was not immediately available. The San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Transit Police Bureau is investigating the collision.

BY EMILY MIBACH
Daily Post Staff Writer
A woman miraculously survived after her car — which was trapped between backed-up traffic and a railroad crossing arm — was hit by a 78 mph Caltrain in Menlo Park tonight (Oct. 23), according to Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman.
The woman, who is in her 30s, was headed west on Ravenswood Avenue at 6:15 p.m. when she stopped on the railroad tracks between Alma Street and El Camino Real. When the crossing lights lit up, indicating a train was on its way, she was stuck. The cars in front of her and behind her wouldn’t move, even though she was frantically honking her horn.
“She was honking, but there was not a whole lot of room for her to move,” Schapelhouman said.
Witnesses told firefighters that the train lifted the car off the ground. The car was thrown into the air and landed parallel with the train tracks. The woman was still in the car.
The train was headed south at 78 mph. The train was not damaged and did not stop, according to Schapelhouman.
Remarkably, after the train passed and the car hit the ground, the woman was able to drive the vehicle. She circled back to park in the Caltrain parking lot, saying that something “didn’t feel right” when she drove her car — only to find out that the back of her car had been sheared off.
“It’s amazing the car was still drivable and she wasn’t more severely insured or even killed,” said Battalion Chief Dan Coyle.
The woman was taken to Stanford Hospital after complaining of neck and back pains.
This is not the first time someone has been stuck on the tracks at that location during rush hour. On Feb. 23, 2015, Jahyun Jennifer Koo, 35, of Palo Alto, died when she became trapped between a railroad gate and a car stopped by traffic in front of her.
Her death resulted in a lawsuit against Caltrain, San Mateo County and the city of Menlo Park. The outcome of the lawsuit wasn’t available tonight.
Koo’s death also prompted the city to install temporary medians on Ravenswood Avenue from Alma to Noel Drive to prevent left-hand turns onto Ravenswood from Alma Street.
“This at-grade crossing is notorious for many significant near misses and sadly tragic accidents involving the loss of life. It’s a poorly designed crossing exacerbated by people who are in a hurry and not paying attention that can then suddenly find themselves in harm’s way,” said Schapelhouman. “The train can’t swerve to avoid an impact and if the Express is coming through it takes about a mile for it to slow down and stop because it’s going about 80 mph. This should have been improved years ago, but the debate on how to fix this crossing has gone on for decades … in the meantime our firefighters continue to directly deal with the very real deadly consequences and close calls associated with it.”
After decades of squabbling over how to separate the train tracks from the road at Ravenswood, the council decided earlier this year to raise the tracks and lower the road at Ravenswood. It’s estimated the separation will cost $190 million.",Caltrain,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,10,23,2023,18,PM,Menlo Park,Unknown,San Mateo,CA,6,Menlo Park,Ravenswood Avenue,Public,A,Auto,78,2,South,1,Stalled or stuck on crossing,1,Train (units pulling),Unknown,1,Rail equipment struck highway user,4,Neither,4,Neither,Unknown,Unknown,2,Day,1,Clear,1,Freight Train,1,Main,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,78,E,mph,Unknown,2,South,1,Gates,Unknown,A,Dry,1,Both sides,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,30s,2,Female,2,No,2,Stopped and then proceeded,Unknown,Unknown,8,Not obstructed,3,Uninjured,1,Yes,0,0,Unknown,1,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,0,0,No,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

The coroner's office identified the man who was struck and killed by a freight train Monday night as Anthony Michael Thimmes, 37. No other information has been determined about him at this point. The coroner is still investigating the cause of the death.
Caltrain confirmed that Thimmes - who was struck and killed by a Union Pacific train near San Mateo Avenue in downtown San Bruno - had apparently intentionally threw himself in front of the train.

Spokeswoman Christine Dunn said the Union Pacific train that struck Thimmes was on its way to pick up freight cars in Santa Clara. The train was not pulling any freight cars at the time of the accident.
Following the accident, trains were delayed in both directions for about two hours. All tracks were reopened for service at 9:32pm, Dunn said.

San Bruno resident Jose Romero was walking his dog on Huntington Avenue around 7:50 p.m., a few minutes after the accident occurred, and said he overheard a woman telling emergency crews that she saw a man throw himself in front of the train.
Romero said he didn't realize what had happened until he saw the police cars and fire engines arrive at the scene.
""That's when it all clicked that that's what she was saying,"" Romero said.
He said there are a lot of homeless people that usually congregate in the area at night.
There have been eight fatalities on Caltrain tracks this year, five of which have been determined to be suicides, Dunn said. Last year there were 19 train-related fatalities. Of those, 15 incidents were found to be suicides and four were accidental.
Suicide prevention signs had recently been installed by CalTrain. The call station is located in San Carlos.

The Amtrak Pacific Surfliner stuck a semi hauling fertilizer that was stuck on the tracks just south of Guadalupe on Friday morning. There were no injuries reported. California Highway Patrol

Amtrak Pacific Surfliner passengers faced long delays after Train 774 struck a tractor trailer carrying fertilizer just south of Guadalupe early Friday morning.





California Highway Patrol Santa Maria spokesman Efrem Moore said there were no injuries reported in the collision, which occurred sometime between when dispatch first received a call of a semi stuck on the tracks at 7:39 a.m. and when emergency personnel showed up at 7:45 a.m.

Though the semi was loaded with ammonium nitrate for the nearby fields, Moore said “none of that was released” in the collision.

Daily Post Staff Writer

A 16-year-old girl who was struck by a Caltrain in Palo Alto died by suicide, according to the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office.

The girl went to Gunn High School, Superintendent Don Austin said in a community update.

The coroner’s office said her ID hasn’t been confirmed by her family, so her name wasn’t available for release Friday.

The girl was hit just before noon on Tuesday (Feb. 20) at the E. Meadow Drive crossing.

Her death came less than 24 hours after a 27-year-old woman was hit and killed by three different cars while stopped on her bike on Embarcadero Road on Monday night.

Mayor Greer Stone put out a statement yesterday urging the community to come together and check on one another.

A person was struck and killed by a train in Palo Alto on Sunday night.

A pedestrian was struck and killed by a Caltrain in Palo Alto on April 16, 2023. Embarcadero Media file photo by Veronica Weber.

Caltrain Media Relations Manager Tasha Bartholomew said at 8:43 p.m., southbound train 678 struck and killed a person at the Churchill Avenue grade crossing in Palo Alto.

Bartholomew said at 9:19 p.m. that emergency personnel were at the scene and train service was stopped at the incident area.

There are approximately 46 passengers onboard, with no other injuries reported. This is Caltrain’s second fatality of the year.

The person was identified as Stanford graduate student Jonathan San Miguel, according to an April 17 letter by Susie Brubaker-Cole, vice provost for student affairs.

Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin told this news organization that the district doesn’t have any reason to believe the person who died was affiliated with the school district.

The San Mateo County Sheriff’s Transit Police Bureau is investigating the fatal incident.

The driver of the Tesla reportedly tried to beat the train through the crossing, NBC Bay Area learned.

Witnesses told NBC Bay Area the Tesla driver was sitting on the tracks and distracted when the crossing arm came down on the car. She reportedly exited the car, moved the arm off the vehicle then tried to beat the train.

A Capitol Corridor train slammed into a Tesla on the tracks Wednesday morning in Santa Clara.

Police, VTA and work crews showed up to the scene where parts of the car were thrown in all directions.

A passing driver who works near the scene of the incident told NBC Bay Area a large section of the Tesla's drive train actually hit his car.

The driver of that car, Emilio Martinez, is a licensed EMT and was able to help the Tesla driver who sustained minor injuries, police said.

The Capitol Corridor train was delayed as crews checked for damage and fortunately, no passengers were injured.

Witnesses who saw the incident happened are shaken up, but relieved.

A crash with a train is definitely one of them. Fortunately for a driver in Santa Clara, she happened to be inside a Tesla, and she was able to escape the frightening ordeal with minor injuries. 



The incident happened on Wednesday morning when a Capitol Corridor train smashed into what appears to be a Midnight Silver Tesla Model Y on the 600 block of Martin Avenue in Santa Clara. Videos taken of the incident’s aftermath show a crushed Tesla with its airbags deployed. 



As noted in a report from NBC Bay Area, the driver of the Tesla reportedly tried to beat the train through the crossing — an incredibly dangerous move and one that could have easily claimed a life. According to witnesses interviewed by the news outlet, the Tesla driver was reportedly sitting on the tracks when the crossing arm came down on the vehicle. 



The Tesla driver reportedly seemed distracted when the crossing arm hit the electric car. Witnesses were then shocked to see the driver reportedly exit the vehicle to move the arm off the Tesla. The driver then reportedly tried to beat the train but was unsuccessful. The train smashed into the all-electric vehicle, and its parts ended up being thrown in all directions. 



Despite the Tesla driver’s apparent carelessness and recklessness, she was ultimately lucky. One driver, Emilio Martinez, whose vehicle was hit by a large section of the Tesla, was actually a licensed EMT, so he ended up being the first responder on the scene. The Tesla driver didn’t respond to the EMT at first, though later statements from the police indicated that the EV driver only sustained minor injuries. No passengers from the train were injured during the crash as well. 
Ultimately, crashes such as this are among the reasons why Tesla is pushing the development of technologies like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. Systems like FSD tend to drive conservatively and cautiously, and they do not get distracted. Thus, when solutions such as FSD are fully rolled out, instances of accidents from distracted drivers would likely see a notable decline.

Family members say Michelle Espinoza is an effervescent 14-year-old with an infectious personality. She remains at Valley Medical Center where she is fighting for her life.
“It’s hard. We can’t believe this happened. We wanna know how it happened,” said Liliana Rosas, the girl’s aunt.
Rosas and other family members sat outside the hospital Friday morning, trying to make sense of it all.
Espinoza clings to life in critical condition, with a fractured skull, swelling of the brain, broken ribs and clavicle, and other injuries.
Late Wednesday morning, Espinoza was riding her bike near Southwest Expressway and Stokes Street. She was hit by a VTA light rail train as it made its way through the intersection.
“All we know is that we’re thankful she’s alive and she’s fighting. She’s very strong,” said Eliana Espinoza, Michelle’s older sister.
San Jose police say the teen was riding her bike east on Stokes Street and went around the crossing barriers, which were functioning. She peddled across the tracks, but there’s no explanation as to how or why she was hit by the southbound train. VTA officials stress being situationally aware when near or using their system.
“Often times, you may not see or hear a bus coming. So it’s important you look both directions,"" said Holly Perez, a VTA spokeswoman. ""Remove the distractions like earbuds, and really follow the directional signs. Whether it’s lights, directional signs or crossing gates.""
After Espinoza was struck, family member say a Good Samaritan pulled her off the tracks and administered CPR.
In the family's search for answers to the accident, they want to personally thank the stranger who may have helped save a 14-year-old’s life.
“We would love for the person who helped her to come forward. And we would like to meet them, and thank them and just give them a big hug,” said Eliana Espinoza.
The Espinoza family set up a “GoFundMe” page for Michelle, to help with costs associated with her medical bills.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- Security video from Hapa's Brewery shows customers outside enjoying their beer when all of a sudden a vehicle collides with a VTA train. The car, a gold Buick Regal, is mangled, while the train runs off its rails.

""The corner of my eye just happen to see this dude turning right when the train came and hit him and for a half a second my brain didn't register what it was and then you heard the loudest sound you've ever heard,"" said witness Ryan Stern.

The train operator and the roughly 20 passengers on board suffered no serious injuries. Passenger Jose Zarate is recovering from a sore hand.

""It felt like a tin can just crunching. You see the walls coming down on you. You don't know what to expect you know? I didn't know if it was a bomb. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know it was a car until after,"" said Zarate.

The male driver of the Buick and his male passenger died at the scene. Witnesses say they may have been living out of their car. They say it was packed with possessions.

""We all went out to the car and the dude was barely breathing and people were telling him to stay with him but it's pretty hard to survive a wreck like that,"" said Stern.

San Jose Police say the crossing arms were down and functioning, but the man behind the wheel still tried to drive around them. Investigators say the Buick was going south while the Mountain View to Winchester VTA train was heading north.

""We're just encouraging everyone that safety is really everyone's job so whether you're a pedestrian, driving a vehicle or a bicyclist, we all need to exhibit caution with the crossing gates, signs and platforms,"" said VTA Spokesperson Holly Perez.

Currently, a bus bridge is transporting passengers between stations. Service disruptions will likely continue for the next day or so. VTA says passengers should check their website and Twitter feed for service updates.

California Highway Patrol (CHP) officials stated that the crash occurred around 1:45 PM on Old Chittenden Road near Highway 129. A 63-year-old woman from Watsonville driving a white Honda Fit was traveling north on a private road close to Old Chittenden Road. Simultaneously, a train was heading west on the tracks just ahead of her vehicle.
For reasons yet to be determined, the car and the train collided. Fortunately, the driver sustained only minor injuries and was promptly taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance for medical evaluation and treatment. None of the passengers or crew members on the train were injured in the crash.
The CHP is actively investigating the cause of the accident. Preliminary assessments indicate that drugs and alcohol do not appear to be contributing factors.
Personal Injury Claims
Determining fault in a collision can hinge on various factors, and in California, partial liability can be assigned to multiple parties. Assisting in establishing legal liability is one of the key roles that a personal injury attorney can fulfill for victims recovering from a traffic accident.
Suppose it is determined that the actions of another contributed toward the injuries. In that case, victims may qualify to file a personal injury claim with the insurance provider of those responsible. Such a claim can offer compensation to help offset hospital expenses, burial costs, and the loss of income from taking time off work for recovery.

Pedestrian Killed in Suisun City Train Collision Near Main Street
A Suisun City train collision on the Capitol Corridor route caused significant service disruptions on the evening of May 7. According to the Amtrak train status map, train 540, heading toward Sacramento, was halted just east of the Suisun-Fairfield station due to a service disruption on the tracks when a pedestrian was struck and killed.
Passengers Switched to Alternative Following Suisun City Train Collision
Capitol Corridor spokespersons reported shortly before 7:30 p.m. that arrangements were being made for passengers on Train 540 to transfer to an alternative train in Suisun City. The disruption follows an ongoing investigation at the collision scene, and exact details remain unclear. The Suisun City Police Department confirmed they are investigating the incident involving the death and noted that they will provide more information as it becomes available.
Railway Negligence and Legal Responsibility
Railway companies must follow regulations and perform routine maintenance to ensure the safety of vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians who may cross their tracks. Failure to fulfill this responsibility can lead to a Suisun City train collision that results in property damage, severe injuries, or even fatalities. Instances of railway negligence can create grounds for holding railroad companies accountable in the event of a train collision with another vehicle.
- Safety: Railroads and their employees are responsible for adhering to all safety regulations when operating on the tracks. Taking safety precautions at railroad crossings is vital, and railroads can be held liable for any damages or injuries caused by employees who fail to follow these standards.
- Maintenance and Repair: Proper maintenance of tracks and crossings is essential to prevent accidents such as derailments and collisions. Rail companies may be held responsible for damages resulting from train collisions if they neglect to maintain their infrastructure.
- Train Collisions Involving Pedestrians and Vehicles: To ensure safety, it is crucial for railroads to properly maintain crossings and tracks, as well as for individuals to exercise caution when crossing railroad intersections to avoid a Suisun City train collision. Failure by the owner of the tracks and crossings to do so can result in liability for the railroad company in case of accidents or injuries.
Seeking Justice After a Fatal Train Accident
Losing a loved one in a train collision is a devastating experience, and it is crucial to seek legal assistance promptly to ensure accountability for the damages. Consulting with a personal injury attorney can provide valuable guidance and help protect your rights. To recover financial losses and secure compensation for the emotional and psychological impact, families may consider filing a wrongful death claim.

													THIS IS KCRA THREE NEWS AT NOON. THE CONCLAVE TO ELECT A NEW POPE IS UNDERWAY. WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE SECRET PROCESS? AS CARDINALS CAST THEIR VOTES FOR THE NEXT PONTIFF? REAL ID REGULATIONS HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE YET TO GET YOUR ID, AND HOW IT COULD IMPACT YOUR FUTURE TRAVEL PLANS. THE TRIAL AGAINST THE ACCUSED DAVIS STABBER CONTINUES. THE EMOTIONAL TESTIMONIES IN COURT. WE BEGIN AT NOON WITH THE PROCESS TO ELECT A NEW POPE. IT’S OFFICIALLY UNDERWAY AT THE VATICAN TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON. I’M LISA GONZALEZ. THANKS FOR JOINING US AT NOON. AND YOU CAN SEE CARDINALS FROM AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING THE NEXT PONTIFF. HERE THEY ARE. THIS WAS THE SCENE AS 133 CATHOLIC CARDINALS ENTERED THE SISTINE CHAPEL EARLIER TODAY TO BEGIN THE PAPAL CONCLAVE. JAY GRAY HAS MORE AS CARDINAL ELECTORS HAVE CLOSED THE DOORS AND HAVE TAKEN A VOW OF SECRECY. AS WE ALL AWAIT THE SMOKE SIGNALS OF THE CASTED VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON. THE DOORS TO THE SISTINE CHAPEL CLOSED AND LOCKED. THE CONCLAVE HAS OFFICIALLY STARTED HERE. THE CARDINAL VOTERS MOVING INTO THE SISTINE CHAPEL, TAKING THEIR OATH OF SECRECY. AND THEN, AS THOSE DOORS ARE CLOSED, THEY WILL MEDITATE A BIT AND WE EXPECT THEM TO FILE THEIR FIRST BALLOTS TODAY TO TAKE THEIR FIRST VOTE. AFTER THAT IS DONE, WE WILL SEE THE SMOKE. MOST AGREE THAT THEY DON’T BELIEVE A CARDINAL WILL BE PICKED. TODAY. WE EXPECT TO SEE BLACK SMOKE FROM THAT CHIMNEY ATOP THE SISTINE CHAPEL. BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BEGINNING TO THIS CONCLAVE. IT’S ONE WHERE THEY WILL GET A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHO MAY HAVE THE MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW, MOVING INTO ALL OF THIS. AND THIS WILL REALLY FRAME WHAT HAPPENS MOVING FORWARD HERE. THE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE. IF THERE’S NO POPE TOMORROW, TWO VOTES IN THE MORNING, TWO VOTES IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THE WAITING AND WATCHING FOR THAT SMOKE IS ALL THAT’S LEFT. THAT’S THE VERY LATEST RIGHT NOW FROM HERE AT THE VATICAN. I’M JAY GRAY, NBC NEWS, AND WE ARE STANDING BY TO GO TO AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THESE LIVE PICTURES, BLACK SMOKE COMING FROM THE CHIMNEY. THIS IS AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT. HERE’S LESTER HOLT. GOOD EVENING FROM ROME. AS WE LOOK AT THE SISTINE CHAPEL, WE SEE BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING FROM THE CHIMNEY. THIS MEANS THE CARDINALS GATHERED FOR THE CONCLAVE HAVE NOT DECIDED ON A NEW POPE. IN THEIR FIRST BALLOT. THIS MEANS THE CONCLAVE WILL CONTINUE INTO AT LEAST TOMORROW, BEFORE THE WORLD KNOWS WHO THE NEXT LEADER OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL BE. LET ME BRING IN NOW, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT ANNE THOMPSON AND OUR SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST, GEORGE WEIGEL. AND ANNE, LET ME START WITH YOU. NOT UNEXPECTED. NO. THREE HOURS AND 16 MINUTES. I BELIEVE YOU CLOCKED THIS AT SINCE THE DOORS CLOSED IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL. 133 ELECTORS, THE LARGEST NUMBER THEY’VE EVER HAD. SO WE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE LONG. IT WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. BENEDICT’S THE FIRST VOTE, AND BENEDICT’S CONCLAVE WENT TO 805. THIS WAS A LOT LONGER, GEORGE. IT WAS A LOT LONGER, BUT I DON’T THINK IT WILL BE QUITE THIS LONG TOMORROW. THERE WON’T BE A SERMON BEFORE THEY START VOTING. THERE WILL BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL MOVE AT A SLIGHTLY LESS THAN STATELY PACE TOMORROW. LET ME GO TO OUR CORRESPONDENT, MOLLY HUNTER. SHE’S WITH THE CROWD ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE. THE VATICAN HAS BEEN GREAT ANTICIPATION. THOUSANDS OF CROWDED INTO SAINT PETER’S SQUARE. TELL US THE SCENE. WHEN WHEN THAT SMOKE WAS APPARENTLY BLACK, I LASSEN. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU. THE CROWDS ARE NOW STREAMING OUT OF THIS AREA. THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND SO MUCH ANTICIPATION FOR THE LAST THREE HOURS. AND I GOT TO SAY, EVERY TIME THERE WAS KIND OF A GASP OR A CLAP, EVERYONE WOULD GET THEIR PHONES UP AND POINT IT TOWARDS THE CHIMNEY. I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO ELIZABETH AND RANDY GIRLS. YOU’VE BEEN OUT HERE NOW FOR MORE THAN THREE HOURS. WHAT WAS THAT MOMENT LIKE TO SEE THAT BLACK SMOKE COMING OUT? IT WAS, I MEAN, KIND OF CRAZY. IT WAS. YEAH, IT WAS A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE. WE’VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THIS BEFORE, SO IT’S JUST BEEN AWESOME TO GET TO FINALLY HAVE THAT MOMENT OF RELIEF. AND ALSO HISTORICAL, HISTORICAL MOMENT FOR US. SO YOU GUYS ARE ALSO LUCKY YOU’RE IN TOWN FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. SO YOU THINK YOU THINK YOU ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE A NEW POPE COME IN? YEAH, YEAH. WE’RE HOPEFUL. VERY HOPEFUL. SO SEEING THE BLACK SMOKE IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING RIGHT NOW. BUT JUST BECAUSE WE’RE READY AND EXCITED TO SEE WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU, YOU’LL BE BACK IN THE MORNING. YEAH. YES. SO I’LL LET’S LOOK AT THE CROWDS JUST STREAMING OUT RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO FOR THE LAST THREE HOURS, STANDING OUT HERE WILL BE BACK TOMORROW. THEY WILL REMAIN ON SMOKE WATCH AND EVERYONE IS IS ECHOING THAT HOPEFUL IS WHAT WE’RE HEARING TONIGHT. MOLLY THANKS VERY MUCH. REMARKABLE SCENE THERE AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THE BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING FROM THE CHIMNEY. THERE WAS NO MISTAKING IT. AND PAST CONCLAVES THERE WERE A FEW QUESTIONS OF WHAT WE WERE SEEING, BUT VERY CLEARLY BLACK SMOKE, MEANING THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO FOR THE CARDINAL ELECTORS AS THEY RETURN TO VOTING TOMORROW. AND THOMPSON, YOU WERE WITH ME. A LOT OF FOLKS WILL PROBABLY TRY TO READ A LOT INTO THE THE LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY WERE WORKING ESSENTIALLY ON JUST ONE VOTE, RIGHT? WELL, PART OF IT IS THEY HAVE TO GET USED TO IT. I MEAN, THEY PHYSICALLY THEY HAVE TO WRITE THE NAME OF THEIR CANDIDATE AND THEN WALK THE BALLOT UP AND THEN SWEAR AN OATH AND PUT IT IN THE URN. SO THERE’S SOME OF THAT, BUT I DON’T THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE ANYTHING FROM THIS. IT’S JUST THE FIRST VOTE, AND IT’S A BIT OF A BEAUTY PAGEANT. IS THAT. AND IT’S A IT’S A FIRST VOTE THAT WAS PRECEDED BY WHAT I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY ASSUME WAS A FAIRLY LONG SERMON FROM THE FORMER PREACHER TO THE PAPAL HOUSEHOLD. CARDINAL CANTALAMESSA. I WOULDN’T READ MUCH OF ANYTHING INTO THIS EXCEPT THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR 133, OFTEN ELDERLY MEN, TO TO WALK UP AND CAST A BALLOT A LITTLE BIT SHORTER TOMORROW, I THINK. SO NOW THAT THE VOTING IS OVER FOR TODAY, WHAT IS LIKELY HAPPENING, I PRESUME THEY’LL HAVE A MEAL. DO THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE CANDIDATES AT THIS POINT. SO THEY’LL THEY’LL GO BACK TO THE CASTLE OF SANTA MARTA FOR DINNER. THOSE TABLES USUALLY ORGANIZE THEMSELVES BY NATIONAL GROUP OR LANGUAGE GROUP. I’M SURE THERE’LL BE SOME DISCUSSION OF OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY. OF COURSE, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE VOTING PATTERN WAS TODAY. THEY’RE OFTEN COMPLIMENTARY VOTES CAST ON THE FIRST BALLOT IN A CONCLAVE. TO SOMEONE WHO’S SUFFERED GREATLY FOR THE CHURCH, SOMEONE WHO SERVED THE CHURCH A LONG TIME. THE REAL INDICATOR AS TO WHERE THE ELECTORAL LANDSCAPE LIES, HOW IT LIES WILL COME. IN THOSE FIRST TWO BALLOTS. TOMORROW MORNING AND AND THE THE BURNING. OF COURSE, NOT ONLY SIGNIFYING THAT THERE IS NOT A POPE, BUT ALSO WE KNOW THE BALLOTS THEMSELVES ARE BURNED RIGHT BEFORE THEY ARE BURNED. IS EVERYONE IN THE ROOM? IS YOU UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE AT THAT POINT? THEY DO. THERE ARE THREE CARDINALS WHO COUNT THE BALLOTS. THEY’RE CALLED SCRUTINEERS. AND THE THIRD ONE ANNOUNCES THE WHO THE VOTE IS FOR AND KEEPS THE SCORECARD. AND THEN THERE ARE THREE OTHER CARDINALS THAT VERIFY THE COUNT TO MAKE SURE IT’S RIGHT. SO THOSE CARDINALS IN THE ROOM HAVE A VERY GOOD IDEA OF WHO GOT THE MOST BALLOTS ON THE FIRST VOTE. AND NOW I THINK WHAT HAPPENS OVER DINNER AND AT BREAKFAST TOMORROW IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE THE VOTES ARE GOING TO GO IN THE SECOND BALLOT, WHO’S GOT WHO’S GOT MOMENTUM OR WHERE THE MOMENTUM COULD BE. YEAH. AND GEORGE, WHAT I KNOW THIS IS A SECRETIVE PROCESS. SO WE ONLY HAVE SO MUCH INSIGHT INTO THAT. BUT HOW WOULD THAT HOW WOULD THAT LIKELY GO. THE GENERAL PATTERN LESTER LESTER IS THAT IF YOU CAN GROW YOUR VOTE TOTAL, YOU’RE IN GOOD SHAPE. IF YOU PEAK AT A CERTAIN POINT, FLATTEN OUT, YOUR CANDIDACY IS MOST PROBABLY OVER. BUT IN A SUPERMAJORITY VOTING SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHERE YOU NEED TWO THIRDS TO WIN. A STRONG MINORITY OF 45 CAN REALLY DRIVE THE DECISION MAKING IN A WAY THAT’S NOT THE CASE WHEN YOU HAVE A MAJORITY VOTING PROCESS. ONE OTHER THING TO ADD TO WHAT ANNE JUST SAID, INDIVIDUAL CARDINALS ARE KEEPING THEIR OWN SCORECARDS. NOW. THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THOSE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY THEY LEAVE, BUT YEAH. NO, I THINK TOMORROW MORNING THEY’LL HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE CORRELATION OF FORCES, IF I MAY SAY SO. LIKE THAT IS. ALL RIGHT. LET ME GO BACK TO SAINT PETER’S SQUARE. MOLLY IS STANDING BY THERE WITH THE CROWDS. THOUSANDS WHO PACKED IN FOR A VIEW OF A LARGE JUMBOTRON THERE IN FRONT OF THE BASILICA, SHOWING FOCUS ON THAT CHIMNEY. MOLLY. LESTER. VATICAN NEWS TELLS US THAT ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE WERE HERE. I’VE GOT TO SAY, AFTER THAT NEWS CAME OUT, IT LOOKED LIKE PEOPLE WERE STILL STREAMING IN. SO NOW YOU CAN SEE EVERYONE’S LEAVING. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PACKED. AND BEING HERE JUST ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, WITH ABOUT 250,000 PEOPLE, THERE WAS STILL ROOM TO MOVE AROUND AND THERE WAS A LOT OF JOY. EVERYONE WAS VERY RESPECTFUL TONIGHT. AND AGAIN, WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS EARLIER, LESTER. BUT THIS KIND OF COMMUNAL ATMOSPHERE, THOUGH, FOR TOURISTS WHO WERE JUST CURIOUS, WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON VACATION FOR PEOPLE THAT FLEW DIRECTLY OVER FOR THIS, FOR PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE IN ROME WHO KIND OF HEARD EARLIER THE ANNOUNCEMENTS, HEARD THE SINGING COMING OUT FROM THESE JUMBOTRONS AND WERE CALLED TO THE SQUARE. IT WAS THIS UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE TO BE OUT HERE, VERY DIVERSE, LOTS OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, LOTS OF DIFFERENT FLAGS THAT WE STARTED TO SEE. LESTER. AND WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYES OUT, OF COURSE, FOR LITTLE POCKETS, KIND OF NATIONAL POCKETS POPPING UP WITH FLAGS. PEOPLE WERE CHANTING. THE OTHER THING WE NOTICED TONIGHT IS THAT OCCASIONALLY SOMEONE WOULD GET EXCITED SOMEWHERE IN THE CROWD, AND SOME APPLAUSE WOULD BREAK OUT, OR SOMEONE WOULD POINT AT THE CHIMNEY OR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIMNEY, AND IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN A BIRD, BUT PEOPLE WERE GETTING JUMPY BY THE KIND OF THREE HOUR MARK. LESTER. YEAH, WAITING. I THINK WE WERE ALL A BIT CURIOUS AS TO WHAT’S TAKING THEM SO LONG. WE’LL PROBABLY NEVER HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, BUT I THINK IT WAS WIDELY SHARED AROUND HERE, ESPECIALLY AS THE EVENING GROWS COOL AND A LITTLE LESS COMFORTABLE TODAY. MOLLY, THANKS VERY MUCH. AND AND AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO TOMORROW, REMIND US HOW THIS WORKS, THEY’LL TAKE A TOTAL OF FOUR VOTES TOMORROW. THERE’LL BE TWO BALLOTS IN THE MORNING. AND IF THERE IS NO POPE ELECTED ON THE FIRST BALLOT IN THE MORNING, THEY WON’T BURN THAT UNTIL THE SECOND BALLOT HAPPENS. AND THEN THEY’LL BURN BOTH OF THOSE TOGETHER. AND THEN THE SAME PROCESS HAPPENS IN THE AFTERNOON. AND THEN IF WE GET TO SUNDAY AND THERE IS NO ONE SELECTED. THINGS. THERE’S A PAUSE. THERE’S A DAY OFF FROM VOTING. THE SENIOR CARDINAL DEACON, WHO’S CARDINAL DOMINIQUE MAMBERTI, WOULD GIVE AND WOULD ADDRESS THE WHOLE GROUP. THERE WOULD BE A WHOLE DAY FOR PEOPLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, AND THEN THEY’D PICK UP THE VOTING AGAIN ON MONDAY. BUT WE HAVEN’T GOTTEN THERE IN PREVIOUS NO REASON. NO. AND I, I THINK IT WOULD BE EXCEPTIONAL IF WE GOT THERE THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR WAITING IT OUT WITH US HERE AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH. SO THAT CONCLUDES THIS NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS PAPAL CONCLAVE. WE’LL HAVE MUCH MORE AHEAD ON OUR STREAMING NETWORK, NBC NEWS, NOW ONLINE AT NBC NEWS.COM. AND A FULL WRAP UP TONIGHT ON NBC NIGHTLY NEWS. I’M LESTER HOLT IN ROME. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AND GOOD DAY. AND THAT WAS AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT. ONE LAST LIVE LOOK, VATICAN CITY, AND YOU CAN SEE SAINT PETER’S SQUARE THERE. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GATHERED WAITING TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE CHIMNEY. WE DID SEE BLACK SMOKE COMING FROM THE CHIMNEY. AND THAT SIGNALED A VOTE HAD BEEN MADE. NO POPE WAS ELECTED. THAT WAS ABOUT AFTER THREE HOURS OF WAITING. AND WHEN THE DECISION IS OFFICIALLY MADE, WE WILL KNOW THAT THE NEW POPE HAS BEEN SELECTED BECAUSE WE WILL SEE WHITE SMO

An Amtrak train collision occurred with a motor vehicle in Fairfield on April 26, resulting in one fatality and injuries. The accident happened at about 8:39 a.m. at the East Tabor and Railroad Avenues crossing. Authorities with the Fairfield Fire Department reported that the vehicle that was struck by the train initially hit another car, resulting in major damage.

Investigation Underway to Determine Cause of Train Collision

One person died in the collision, while several others suffered major to moderate injuries and were transported to trauma centers for treatment. The accident is being investigated to determine fault and how it occurred.

Negligent Railroads Can Cause Motor Vehicle Collisions

When operating on tracks, railroads are required to obey regulations and perform regular maintenance to protect vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians that may cross. Upon failing to do this, they may cause serious accidents that can damage property, cause injury and even result in death. Railway negligence can result in several ways of holding railroads responsible in a train crash with another vehicle:

Equipment defects: Railroads are responsible for ensuring their equipment, such as brakes, tracks, couplings and engines, are in proper working order. Railroads can be liable for train crashes caused by defective equipment if they fail to perform maintenance or use old, outdated machinery or parts.

Track maintenance resulting in negligence: Railroads are responsible for properly maintaining tracks to ensure they are free of debris or other hazards that might cause an oncoming train to collide. In addition, worn tracks can lead to a train collision or derailment, so maintenance and repair are especially important. Rail companies can be held liable for damages resulting from train-vehicle collisions if they fail to maintain their tracks and crossings properly.

Safety: Taking safety precautions when passing through railroad crossings and following all safety regulations is the responsibility of railroads and their employees when operating on the tracks. Railroads are liable for damages or injuries caused by employees who fail to do so.

Wrongful Death Claims After a Train Accident

In the event of the death of a loved one in a train collision, you should seek legal help as soon as possible so everyone is held accountable for the damages. Your case can be evaluated by a personal injury attorney who will fight for your rights. To recover financial losses and receive compensation for emotional and psychological trauma, the family may wish to file a wrongful death claim.

If an accident attorney determines that negligence by the railway company or others was the cause of death, the family of a deceased loved one can file a wrongful death claim. A person or entity must be proven to have caused the untimely death through negligence. It is possible for the estate administrator or members of the immediate family to file a claim. However, only one claim may be filed. If you would like more information, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

Train 524 on the Capitol Corridor struck a vehicle that was obstructing the track, and that vehicle in turn struck a second vehicle, she said Friday. It was not immediately clear which vehicle Simi was in at the time of the collision.
Several other people were hospitalized after the crash with injuries ranging from major to moderate, CBS affiliate KOVR-TV of Sacramento reported.
No injuries were reported among the train crew or the estimated 120 passengers, according to Just.
The wreck occurred at East Tabor Road and Railroad Avenue, and caused closures of both roads that lasted several hours, police said in a news release. The Amtrak train was delayed by nearly three hours, Just said.
YOUNTVILLE — When the first Rock the Ride fundraiser to end gun violence was held last summer, the Napa Valley community was still reeling fro…
Simi rose to local prominence in the Napa Valley in the wake of Donald Trump’s 2016 election as president, which led her and three others to form Rise Up Napa in response to what they described as a rising threat of racism and intolerance.
“We have a president who doesn’t represent our beliefs,” she told the Napa Valley Register during a December 2016 march Rise Up Napa organized in downtown Napa against the then president-elect. “I realized complacency is no longer an option. We have to get off our couches and out of our houses and organize to stand up for what we believe. This is not politics as usual.”
Simi also was a member of the Napa chapters of the anti-gun-violence group Moms Demand Action, Indivisible and the Rock the Congress political action committee, according to Ermilita Bruce Gulliksen, a friend, neighbor and fellow Rise Up Napa co-founder.
A pair of attacks that killed Napa County residents — the March 2018 Pathway Home shooting in Yountville and a mass shooting that November in Thousand Oaks in which the Napa native Alaina Housley and 12 others died — moved Simi to urge quicker action against “the onslaught of gun violence … in our community and in our country,” she said during the Rock the Ride benefit in 2019 to fundraise for groups battling gun violence.
Lilea Heine, a former neighbor of Simi’s in Browns Valley and the executive director of First 5 Napa Valley, recalled the support Simi lent her and others involved in Rise Up Napa and Moms Demand Action.
“She was so comforting, reminding me of our work to shape the world we want for our kids and for our community,” said Heine, who first came to know Simi when both were serving as volunteer escorts for Planned Parenthood clinic visitors. “She was a great comfort during our time (together).” (Heine is a member of the Napa Valley Register’s editorial board.)
Later Thursday, Bruce Gulliksen reflected on the loss not only of a comrade-in-arms in political activism, but also of a neighbor and loyal friend.
“She was so personable. She would just know you from the first time you met her; she’d find something you had and find something to connect with you,” she said of Simi. “She was just beaming positivity; she was always a great relationship kind of a person.
“I’m still in shock,” said Bruce Gulliksen. “Everyone who knows her is still in shock. She was gone too soon. She had so much life to live.”
Simi leaves behind her husband, daughter and son, along with her parents and two sisters, according to Bruce Gulliksen.

At least one person was killed after a collision between an Amtrak Capitol Corridor train and a vehicle Tuesday morning on railroad tracks south of Davis, authorities said.The crash happened near Tremont and Robben roads in Solano County, at a railroad crossing just east of Interstate 80 and northeast of Dixon city limits, according to an entry on the California Highway Patrol’s online activity log. The Solano County Sheriff’s Office was dispatched for at least one fatality, according to the CHP log.A vehicle struck Train 531 of Amtrak’s Capitol Corridor line about 9:20 a.m., Amtrak spokeswoman Olivia Irvin said in an emailed statement. Train 531 runs from Sacramento to Oakland on weekday mornings, and Tuesday’s incident happened between the train’s Davis and Fairfield stops. “The locomotive separated from the passenger cars on the train, but no major damage occurred to the equipment,” Irvin wrote. “Customers will be transferred to alternative transportation to get to their intended destination.”An alert on the Amtrak website as of 11:30 a.m. said the train’s route has been canceled for the rest of the day due to the “vehicle incident.”No passengers or crew members were injured, Irvin said. There were 62 people on the train at the time of the incident.Video taken from the train showed the passenger cars were separated from the engine car on opposite sides of a crossing at Tremont and Robben. Both appeared to remain on the tracks.This story was originally published April 4, 2023 at 10:46 AM.

SOLANO COUNTY – A fiery crash involving a vehicle and an Amtrak train has left one person dead near Vacaville early Thursday afternoon. The Vacaville Fire Protection District says they responded to the scene near California Pacific and Elmira roads just before 12:30 p.m. Crews found a vehicle fully engulfed after the crash. 
California Highway Patrol has since confirmed one person in the vehicle died; no one else was in the vehicle, officers say. The train crossing arms were down when the vehicle was hit. Due to the crash, train traffic on the Capitol Corridor is delayed. Train 532 is holding in Fairfield-Vacaville, Capitol Corridor says, while Train 543 is being delayed from departing Sacramento.Amtrak released a statement Thursday afternoon saying more than a hundred people were on board the train and they were investigating the incident with authorities.On January 19, Amtrak train 541 was traveling from Sacramento to San Jose at approx. 12:40 when a vehicle obstructing the track came into contact with the train in Elmira, CA with 106 passengers onboard. Amtrak is working with local law enforcement to investigate the incident. According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), trespassing along railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, and railroad crossing incidents are the second leading cause of rail-related deaths in America. These incidents can affect everyone involved—those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers. They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and crossings. Amtrak continues to work closely with Operation Lifesaver (OLI) to #STOPTrackTragedies by emphasizing the obvious dangers of being on railroad property or disregarding warnings at rail crossings.

SANTA ROSA, CA — The driver of a minivan who collided with a SMART train Wednesday in Santa Rosa is suspected of driving under the influence of prescription drugs, Santa Rosa police said.

The crash was reported at 11:04 a.m. Wednesday on the railroad tracks at West Steele Lane, adjacent to Coffey Lane. ""Initial reports indicated that after the crossing arms had lowered to stop traffic, the vehicle (a white minivan) drove through the arms and was struck by the oncoming SMART Train,"" Santa Rosa police Sgt. Josh Ludtke said. ""The train struck the rear driver’s-side of the vehicle as it crossed the tracks, spinning it around, and it came to rest on the northwest side of the intersection.""

The driver of the minivan, a 57-year-old Santa Rosa man, was the only person in the car and was conscious when officers got there but he could not speak and was not alert, Ludtke said. Personnel with the Santa Rosa Fire Department responded alongside an AMR ambulance crew. Once firefighter-paramedics extricated the driver, who was trapped in the minivan, he was taken to a hospital, fire officials said.

The driver did not suffer major injuries, according to police. He was contacted by SRPD accident investigators at the hospital, where he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription drugs, Ludtke said. Police did not disclose the driver's name.

""It appeared the vehicle had been traveling south on Coffey Lane and it had turned west onto West Steele Lane just east of the tracks,"" Ludtke said.

It is more than a mental health condition — states and communities can adopt comprehensive strategies to prevent suicide.  By Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Deputies have identified a Northern California man killed on Sonoma County train tracks on Tuesday as a 68-year-old caretaker who was accused of sexually abusing disabled kids.Keith Marcum of Rohnert Park was struck by the SMART train south of Santa Rosa around 9:30 p.m., according to the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies said they are “investigating the incident as a suicide as the train video clearly shows the man laid on the tracks in front of the train moments before impact.” The death is the third in two weeks on the Sonoma and Marin County train line north of San Francisco, which opened two years ago, according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Marcum represented himself as a certified psychologist and ran an in-home care center for mentally and physically disabled children and adults in Rohnert Park for roughly 30 years, until he was arrested in April on charges of continuous child sexual abuse, sodomy, cruelty to a child and posession of child pornography, according to the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety.Police said Marcum’s arrest came after a former resident revealed a pattern of sexual and physical abuse that began 10 years ago. Two more victims came forward following Marcum’s arrest and said they were sexually abused by Marcum as well from ages 6 to 14, according to police. Police said there could be more victims.During a search of Marcum’s home on Brenda Way in Rohnert Park, detectives discovered more than 600 images of child porn, according to police.“Detectives called family members of the three residents who live there with Marcum to advise them of the investigation and assisted with getting them out of the house,” police said in April, adding that it was then unknown if those residents had been victims as well. Authorities booked Marcum at the Sonoma County jail, where he was held on $765,000 bail, police said. Marcum posted bail and was released, the Press Democrat reported. He was set to appear in court to face charges on July 23, according to KSRO.Sgt. Keith Astley said the investigation revealed Marcum’s clinical psychology bona fides were fraudulent, including claims that he had earned clinical psychology and neurophysiology doctorates, as well as education and cognitive psychology master’s degrees, according to the Press Democrat.“We never found any documentation supporting those degrees Marcum claimed to have obtained,” Astley said, according to the newspaper.Court records said Marcum was arrested in 1981 on child sexual assault allegations in Colorado, but got a deferred four-year sentence, the Press Democrat reports.Marcum wrote a goodbye post on Facebook hours before his death, per the newspaper: “Farewell everyone — it’s been a wonderful life,” Marcum reportedly said.

SANTA ROSA, Calif. (KGO) -- It happens to every major railroad, and SMART train is not immune.

This morning, a female was struck and killed by a Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit train in Santa Rosa Wednesday morning, according to a Sonoma County fire and emergency dispatcher.

The collision was reported at 7:36 a.m. in Santa Rosa at Hearn Avenue near Whitewood Drive. SMART says everything in the intersection functioned normally---the lights, the traffic arms, the horn on the train and a video camera on board that captured everything.

The train hit the victim at full speed, about 79 miles an hour, and the the body came to rest roughly 50 yards down the track.

SMART service was suspended but begin after the crash investigation.

The eastbound lane is closed, and drivers can expect long delays in both directions.

This accident comes one day after The Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit District announced it received more funding from the state, an estimated $10.5 million. It will help increase service because of its popularity.

SMART trains started rolling between Santa Rosa and San Rafael in August.

The trains have carried more than 300, 000 passengers since then, according to the district.

This may be the first fatality involving a SMART train.

(KSEE/KGPE) – A family in Dinuba is mourning the loss of their loved one, 29-year-old Raymond Garza, after he was killed in a car accident just after 2:00 a.m. Saturday morning.

“It’s like a dream, it doesn’t feel real. He’s going to be missed” said Elsa Gonzales. “At five o’clock in the morning I got a knock on my door from the sheriff’s department.”

The Tulare County Sheriff’s Office said it was just after 2 a.m. when Garza and his female passenger were traveling East on Nebraska when they slammed into a stationary train that was parked along the railroad tracks.

The female passenger suffered moderate injuries and Garza was killed on impact.

“My nephew was a loving person. He had a heart of gold he helped people he put others before himself” she said.

One person was killed when a Metrolink train collided with a car in Camarillo on Monday afternoon. It happened a little after 2 p.m. near Las Posas Road and Fifth Street, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. ""Preliminary investigation determined that a white Lincoln MKC was traveling southbound on Las Posas Road and had stopped for a red traffic signal at Fifth Street,"" said a press release from California Highway Patrol investigators. ""While stopped, the vehicle came to rest on the train tracks.""As the train neared the car, the railroad crossing arms activated, police said. ""The train was unable to stop in time and collided with the white Lincoln, which was positioned just north of the intersection,"" the release noted.


The impact of the crash pushed the car dozens of feet, where it came to a rest east of the intersection. The train continued eastbound until it came to a stop about a quarter mile from where the crash occurred. The driver of the Lincoln was declared dead at the scene. He has not yet been identified. ""The train was carrying five passengers and three crew members, none of whom sustained injuries,"" said a post on X from VCSD. Anyone who knows more about the incident is asked to contact CHP detectives at (805) 662-2640.

(This story has been updated with new information from Oxnard police.)
One person was hospitalized with critical injuries Tuesday night after a train struck a semitrailer in Oxnard.
The crash, between a Metrolink train and the big rig, was reported around 7:15 p.m. at Fifth Street and Rice Avenue, according to initial reports.
Battalion Chief John Ceceña, with the Oxnard Fire Department, said at 7:45 p.m. that crews assessed the truck driver and two bystanders — one working at a sidewalk vending location and a woman buying food from the vendor.
Authorities later said debris from the crash struck the patron. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital with a head injury, police officials said in a news release, and was said to be in critical but stable condition Tuesday night.
The food vendor and truck driver refused additional care, Ceceña said.
Of the 13 passengers on the Metrolink train, two complained of pain, authorities said.
The semi had been stopped on southbound Rice when it was hit, Oxnard Police Department officials said in a release. The westbound train hit the rig's trailer.
The Metrolink train started at Los Angeles' Union Station at 5:30 p.m. It had been scheduled to arrive in Oxnard at 7:07 p.m., according to its social media and website.
Oxnard Police Cmdr. Kevin Baysinger said officers also assisted at the scene with the injured.
Because of the crash, both train and vehicle traffic in the immediate vicinity was stopped. Fifth Steet between Rose Avenue and Del Norte Boulevard was closed as were portions of Rice Avenue between Eastman Avenue and East Wooley Road, he said.
The commander said officers were investigating the collision. Alcohol didn't appear to be a factor, department officials later said.
Tuesday's crash happened at a deadly crossing where federal, state and city officials broke ground last month on a major project to build a bridge overpass.
The $134.5 million grade separation project at Rice Avenue and Fifth Street will add up to six lanes to carry vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians over the railroad tracks.
On Feb. 24, 2015, the crossing was the scene of a fatal crash between another Metrolink train and a utility truck that got stuck on the tracks.
Anyone with information about Tuesday's collision is asked to contact traffic coordinator Cpl. Manuel Perez at 805-385-7750 or at manuel.perez@oxnardpd.org.

A Metrolink train and tractor-trailer collided at Rice Avenue and Fifth Street in Oxnard, causing one woman to be hospitalized at about 7:15 p.m. on March 25.
According to the Oxnard Police Department, the train, carrying 13 passengers, struck the trailer of a tractor-trailer as the train crossed Rice Avenue at Fifth Street. The tractor-trailer had been stopped on southbound Rice Avenue and the train was traveling westbound.
Debris from the collision struck a woman at a nearby taco stand. She was transported to a local hospital with a head injury, and was listed in critical but stable condition, according to the Oxnard Police Department.
Two passengers on the train complained of pain, and the driver of the tractor-trailer was not injured.
Alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the collision, according to the Oxnard Police Department's written statement. Traffic investigators also responded to the scene and assisted with the investigation.
The site is the same location where, in 2015, a fatal crash occurred between another Metrolink train and a utility truck that got stuck on the tracks.
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted in July to crack down on sidewalk vending throughout the county, which includes pop-up taco vendors on Rice Avenue.
The 20-month pilot program, costing $1.7 million, was intended to enhance roadside and traffic safety, according to Code Compliance Director Doug Leeper, who provided the supervisors with a presentation, including a video of a vehicle crashing into a food stand also in Oxnard from March 2024.
""It is an issue of safety,"" Leeper said at the July meeting. ""Not just food-borne illness safety and food handling safety, but of personal safety as these folks stop, get out, walk along the roadway, stand and eat in some of these locations.""
Rice Avenue was mentioned specifically during the meeting as the county location with the most vendors observed during the survey, also noting that none of the vending locations observed would be permittable under the ordinance.
Enforcement of the code began in November, with the hiring of a full-time senior code compliance officer, with an annual salary of between $85,068 and $119,302. Enforcement also required the staffing of a senior code compliance officer, a code compliance officer, and a technician, as well as funding for an extra-duty assignment for two senior deputies with the Sheriff’s Office.
For 2025-26, the 12-month pilot program was estimated to require $957,200.
Enforcement was intended to help respond to complaints, make proactive contact with vendors, investigate situations, issue citations and impound equipment and merchandise if it was deemed they presented a safety hazard.
Anyone with more information on the collision is encouraged to contact Corporal Manuel Perez, Oxnard Police Department traffic coordinator, at 805-385-7750 or via email at:manuel.perez@oxnardpd.org.

A 63-year-old woman died Tuesday after an Amtrak train struck her vehicle in Camarillo.
The incident was reported just after 10:35 a.m. at the railroad crossing near the intersection of Upland and Somis roads.
An Amtrak Surfliner headed northbound crashed into a four-door passenger vehicle with one female occupant, the Ventura County Fire Department said.
A woman was shot and injured at her home on Encino Avenue on New Year’s Eve by an ACS Security guard who was patrolling alone.
The vehicle had been traveling west on Upland Road when it stopped on the railroad tracks, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Tuesday.
The engineer saw the vehicle and applied the emergency brakes but was not able to stop the train.
The locomotive struck the vehicle, pushing it into the crossing arm control box, authorities said.
The woman was pulled from the vehicle in critical condition and flown by helicopter to a trauma center, where she later died. Her name has not been released.
Video posted to X, formerly Twitter, by the Fire Department showed the crumpled remains of the vehicle lying near the stopped train.
The collision did not cause the train to derail, and no injuries were reported on board. The crash remains under investigation.

A woman died after her car was struck by an Amtrak passenger train around 11 a.m. Tuesday in Camarillo.
Ventura County firefighters responded to the scene at the intersection of Lewis and Las roads, where Amtrak’s Surfliner 765 was headed north and struck a white passenger car in the intersection.
The motorist, identified as Carole Schlesinger, 63, was heading west on Upland Road alone and, for unknown reasons, stopped on the tracks. The train engineer noticed the vehicle and applied emergency braking in an attempt to halt the train, according to Ventura County Sheriff’s Deputy Luke Riordan.
The collision pushed the Toyota Yaris into the signal box that controls the railroad crossing arms.
The driver was cut from the vehicle by firefighters and airlifted by helicopter to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in critical condition.
She later succumbed to her injuries.
No injuries were reported on the train.
Lewis, Las Posas, and Upland roads were reopened about an hour after the collision, according to firefighter Andy VanSciver.

The collision remains under investigation by the Camarillo Police Department Traffic Bureau. Anyone who may have witnessed the incident is asked to contact Riordan at (805) 388-5100.

A woman died Tuesday after her car stopped at a railroad crossing and was hit by an Amtrak train.

The crash happened around 10:40 a.m. at a crossing located at North Lewis Road and Upland Road.

According to the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office, a 63-year-old woman was driving her vehicle west on Upland Road. For reasons that are under investigation, the woman stopped the vehicle on the tracks.

The Amtrak Pacific Surfliner train had just entered city limits headed southbound and the conductor immediately applied the emergency brake once recognizing there was a vehicle on the tracks.

Despite the emergency braking, the train crashed into the side of the stationary vehicle, pushing it into the signal control box that controls the railroad arms.

Debris from inside the woman’s car could be seen tossed about the crash site.

Fire crews extricated the woman from the mangled vehicle and she was flown by helicopter to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries.

No injuries were reported on the train, which did not derail, the Ventura County Fire Department said.

Around 5 p.m. Tuesday evening, the Sheriff’s Office confirmed that the woman was killed in the crash. She’s been identified only as a 63-year-old transient woman.

The tracks were closed between Moorpark and Camarillo due to the incident and traffic on both Amtrak and Metrolink was affected by the closure.

Officials say traffic signals at the intersection will be flashing red through Wednesday and possibly later.

The Sheriff’s Office is urging drivers to remember the rules of the road when approaching a railroad crossing: if red lights are flashing, you are required to stop, even if the crossing arms aren’t down yet. You should never, under any circumstances, stop your vehicle on railroad tracks.

This deadly collision is under investigation by the Camarillo Police Department Traffic Bureau and any witnesses are urged to contact Deputy Luke Riordan at 805-388-5100.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,10,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Ventura,CA,6,Unknown,Upland Road,Public,A,Unknown,0,4,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,A,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,63,2,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,8,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

At least five people were taken to the hospital after a collision between an Amtrak train and a semi-truck in Ventura County Tuesday evening that blocked traffic and led to the suspension of train service overnight.

The collision occurred in Somis, an unincorporated area of Ventura County, at around 6:20 p.m. on State Route 118 at Sand Canyon Road, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter, by the California Highway Patrol.

Video of the crash scene obtained by KTLA showed a large response by Ventura County Firefighters who responded to the scene to help passengers safely off the train and triage those injured.

Fire officials said five people were taken to local hospitals with minor to moderate injuries.

Investigators said the big rig got stuck on the tracks because of the incline. The driver was able to safely get out of the truck before it was struck by Amtrak’s Pacific Sufrliner, which was headed south to Los Angeles with 95 passengers and five crew members.

Shortly after the crash, Amtrak announced the suspension of the Pacific Surfliner service between Moorpark and Camarillo through Wednesday morning. Commuters were urged to call 800-USA-Rail for reservation assistance.

CHP said that State Route 118 between Balcom Canyon Road and State Route 34 (Somis Road) was expected to be completely closed through the early morning hours so crews could remove the semi-truck and make roadway repairs.

“The last train car is back on the tracks and rolling back to the yard. SR-118 is fully REOPENED just in time for your morning commute,” a tweet from the CHP read.

SR-118 reopened Wednesday morning after the road was shutdown in both directions following a crash between an Amtrak train and a semi-truck in Ventura County.Five passengers on the train suffered minor injuries and were taken to local hospitals, according to the Ventura County Fire Department.  Firefighters said that 90 people were aboard when the train was heading south to Los Angeles in Somis at about 6:20 p.m. on Tuesday. The California Highway Patrol said the truck was in a protected crossing area before it was somehow disabled on the tracks. The driver was able to jump out in time and officers believe that the gradient at the crossing might have played a factor in the tractor-trailer getting stuck.
At least one train car did derail, but it was not blocking the roadway.Both Union Pacific and Amtrak trains use the tracks and will be affected until crews can repair them. Officers plan to close the 118 Freeway at Balcom Canyon and Somis Road for most of the night. The 118 Freeway reopened to traffic early Wednesday morning.

MOORPARK, Calif. (KABC) -- New details emerged Thursday as the investigation continued into the cause of a derailment that occurred after a passenger train struck a water truck in Moorpark.

The driver of the truck was a Ventura County Public Works Agency employee who was providing dust control to nearby workers at the time of the collision on Wednesday morning, according to investigators. The crew was cleaning up a debris basin.

Why the vehicle was in the path of the train, which had about 200 people onboard, remained unclear.

The crash occurred shortly before 11:30 near Los Angeles Avenue and Gabbert Road. Several of the train cars were dislodged from the tracks but all of them remained upright.

Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday night after an Amtrak train was derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

On Thursday afternoon, crews were seen installing new tracks at the crash site as train service remained suspended.

Oxnard resident Ricky Williams, who commutes to downtown Los Angeles, said the trip usually takes him an hour and 40 minutes on the train. On Thursday he was forced to drive to the Moorpark station, which lengthened his commute to more than two hours.

""For me, it's not frustrating at all because I've been doing this for over 10 years,"" Williams said.

No estimate has been given by Amtrak of when train service will resume at the location.

MOORPARK, Calif. (AP) — An Amtrak train carrying nearly 200 passengers struck a county water truck and derailed on Wednesday in Southern California, critically injuring the truck’s driver, authorities said.
Three of the train’s seven cars went off the tracks following the collision in Moorpark, said Ventura County Fire Department Captain Brian McGrath. The derailed train cars remained upright on tracks adjacent to an orchard and bare sections of land.
Fourteen people on the train were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, while the truck driver was taken to a trauma center with a head injury, McGrath said.
Parts of the demolished Ventura County Public Works truck were scattered all around the derailed train cars. McGrath initially said the truck’s driver was believed to have gotten out of the vehicle before the crash, but later clarified that the circumstances leading up to the wreck weren’t known.
“No one’s talked to him, so the whole situation is still being investigated,” he said.
Mindy Faver was seated facing the rear of the train after a trip with her mother, Shari Peterson, returning from visiting family in Oregon.
“All of a sudden: Smack!” Faver said, describing the impact. Then Faver saw what she later found out was the water truck’s tank tumbling past her window.
Most of the passengers were able to get off the train cars on their own or with the aid of first responders, McGrath said. TV news helicopters showed numerous people, many carrying luggage, milling about in a field as firefighters worked the scene.
“It could have been a lot worse,” Faver told the Ventura County Star.
The train was on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle when “it struck a water truck obstructing the tracks” at 11:15 a.m., Amtrak said in a statement.
“There were approximately 198 passengers and 13 crew onboard who were evacuated from the train, with no reports of serious injuries,” the statement said. “Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements.

Sixteen people were hospitalized Wednesday after an Amtrak train struck a public works truck and slid off the tracks in the city of Moorpark, Calif. The 10-car Amtrak Coast Starlight passenger train was traveling northbound, from Los Angeles towards Seattle, when it struck the truck around 11:15 a.m. PT, officials said.  The train was carrying a total of 186 passengers and 13 crew members, none whom required extrication to exit the train, according to the Ventura County Fire Department's Public Information Officer. Amtrak put the passenger count higher, at 198. The truck's driver, a public works employee, was taken to a trauma center. 
Statements from several local agencies characterized the passenger injuries as mostly minor, though some told reporters it was a scary and painful incident.  ""I thought we were goners,"" passenger Theresa Darragh told the Ventura County Star.  Kimberly Mathews, who was traveling in the same car as Darragh, described to the outlet how she'd been left with shoulder and back pain after hitting the stairs during the crash.  ""It feels like somebody took a sledgehammer and just whacked me 50 times,"" she said.  The crash's impact caused three of the train's seven passenger cars to derail, but they stayed upright. Smoke poured out from the train's luggage car, but the fire was extinguished quickly, the fire department said.  Amtrak did not immediately return NPR's request for more information. 
The impacted vehicle, a Ventura County Public Works tanker truck, was atop a level-grade crossing as its employees were cleaning out a channel nearby, the The Star reported. Ventura County Sherriff's Capt. Dean Worthy described the site to the outlet as ""a remote farm road."" The crossing has a stop sign, but no electronic crossing arms, photos show.

Ventura County police and fire officials responded to a ""train versus vehicle"" collision that took place in the city of Moorpark shortly after 11 a.m. on Wednesday. Train number 14, the Coast Star Light, was traveling from Seattle to Los Angeles when it struck a water truck blocking the tracks, Amtrak said in a statement.

""Some of the cars have derailed but are still upright,"" the Ventura County Sheriff's Department tweeted. The train had eight cars, including a baggage car, dining car, two coaches, a lounge, and three sleepers, along with two locomotives, according to the Ventura County Fire Department. Three of the cars derailed, the fire department said, but it did not specify which ones.

MOORPARK, Calif. (KABC) -- Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday evening after an Amtrak train derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

Officials said a total of 16 people were injured, including the driver of the water truck, but there were no serious injuries. If train cars had actually toppled over completely, officials believe there would have been a lot more people injured.

""We're very lucky today that the trains stayed on the wheels,"" said Andy Vansciver of Ventura County Fire. ""Obviously, it was derailed but it stayed vertical. I think that really limited the amount of injuries we had.""

AIR7 HD was above the scene and captured the train with several of its cars off the tracks.

People could also be seen on ambulance stretchers. One couple was headed to the hospital after one of them suffered an arm injury.

The train was traveling westbound and filled with more than 200 people at the time at the crash. Some of the passengers spoke with Eyewitness News about the ordeal.

""Yeah, I was listening to an audio tape when and I was laying back on the sofa, and all of a sudden, we hit very hard and things were flying around,"" said Debbie Welsford of Anaheim. ""Our luggage, my cup, the water ... everything was just flying around the room and we realized we hit something so we came out and looked and saw the water tank.""

""It was very brief. Felt the train make impact and, you know, flew me forward in the car,"" said Matthew Roberts of Paso Robles. ""Immediately got up to see if everyone around me was ok. The car filled with a lot of dust and it took about 30 seconds for the train to come to a stop and we assessed the situation, made sure everyone was ok, and got to the exit and that was it.""

Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday night after an Amtrak train was derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

The water truck was delivering water to local ranches in the rural area when it got in the way of the train. The driver was talking with police before being taken to the hospital. It's unclear why the water truck was in the train's way.

Officials were bussing the uninjured passengers to the Moorpark Senior Center where they could be reunited with loved ones. Amtrak worked with passengers to help them get to their final destination.

The train was set to stop in Oxnard on its way to Seattle.

The tracks themselves have been damaged due to the collision as well and it was unclear how people who use the line to and from work would be able to travel home Wednesday night.

Amtrak released the following statement on the crash:

""On June 28, 2023, Amtrak train 14 was traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle at approx. 11:15 a.m. PT when it struck a water truck obstructing the tracks at Moorpark, California. There were approximately 198 passengers and 13 crew onboard who were evacuated from the train, with no reports of serious injuries. The train derailed as a result of the impact but remained upright. Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements. Amtrak, in coordination with local authorities, is conducting a full investigation.""

- Share via
A woman who police say abandoned her car on railroad tracks in Ventura minutes before the vehicle was struck by a slow-moving Amtrak train has been booked on suspicion of drunk driving, according to police.
Arcelia Delgadillo had unintentionally driven onto the railroad tracks at Garden Street and Harbor Boulevard, where the vehicle became stuck, according to Ventura Police Cmdr. Tom Higgins. The 27-year-old Ventura resident and her passenger then exited the vehicle at about 7:38 p.m. and stood nearby.
About three minutes later, the train’s conductor spotted the vehicle on the tracks and tried to stop. But the train, which was traveling south at 15 to 20 mph, could not stop and plowed into the vehicle.
“When the train struck the vehicle, it possibly caused an electrical shortage which electrified the vehicle and railroad tracks,” Higgins said in a statement. “Due to the rain, this caused an extreme hazard to emergency personnel.”
The vehicle was wedged under the front of the train, which had 60 passengers on board. The passengers were not injured.
The train was delayed for two hours as crews worked to dislodge the vehicle and remove it from the tracks.
Police later arrested Delgadillo and booked her into a Ventura County jail, Higgins said.

Local  resident  Lowell Withington,  76,  died  when  his pickup  truck  was  hit  by  a  train  at  an  unprotected  private crossing in Moorpark on Monday. 

Withington was heading west on Poindexter Avenue. He turned  onto  a driveway that  crossed  the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks to access open land he was leasing on the north side of the tracks when the train arrived. 

As the vehicle was crossing the tracks, the eastbound Amtrak train headed for San Diego struck the driver’s side of the vehicle, sending it into a nearby drainage ditch, said Ron Nelson, spokesperson for the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department. 
AFTERMATH- Fire  and emergency  crews  clear  away the  wreckage  of Withington’s vehicle after a fatal collision.
The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. No one on the train was injured, Nelson said in a press release. 

The train was traveling about 50 miles per hour, said Sr. Dep. Ed Tumbleson for the Moorpark Police Department. The speed limit in the area is 70 miles per hour. The train’s horns were blaring, but the driver never stopped or slowed down, witnesses told police at the scene.x 

Withington,  who  lived  on  Gabbert  Road,  frequently drove across the private crossing to get to the open lot, the deputy said. 

Withington was president of Midway Drilling and Pump Company in Saticoy. 

“He was a very hard-working and caring individual and would make sure that all jobs were done as best as they could for the customers,” said office manager Sandy Cornelius. Withington was a generous man who would give anybody the shirt off his back, she added. 

The  Moorpark  resident  was married to Willa Withington for 54 years. He had two daughters and one son, Harvey Withington, who will now maintain the company, Cornelius said. 

The  unprotected  railroad tracks have been a longstanding problem, said Hugh Riley, assistant city manager for the city of Moorpark. “But the tracks are on private  property,  so  the  city doesn’t have any jurisdiction.” 

“It’s very sad,” said Councilmember  Keith  Millhouse, who serves on a Metrolink committee. 

Although he didn’t know the circumstances of the accident and what caused it, Millhouse wanted to remind people to be extra cautious around rail crossings. 

“We don’t know what caused the collision but trains are deceptive  in  terms  of  the  speed  they move at,” Millhouse said.

A video being taken to show the dangers of a railway crossing ended up capturing the real thing when an Amtrak train smashed through a truck carrying strawberries in Oxnard, Calif.

Gaspar Medina told Associated Press Television News that the incident happened just minutes after setting up his two cameras on Monday afternoon.

The six-wagon train, carrying 80 passengers, did not derail. Two passengers were treated for neck and chest injuries. The truck driver was not injured.

Witnesses told police that the truck, driven by a Theresa Ann Senator of South Dakota, drove under the crossing arms that were being lowered and then stopped on the tracks, according to the Ventura County Star newspaper.

Amtrak passenger Kathleen Paine described the impact as ""like hitting a brick wall,"" the newspaper reported.

Another passenger, Mark Lindgren, said ""it felt like you were hitting a gigantic pothole.""

Police said the impact caused the train’s engine to separate from the six cars it was pulling, but Amtrak denied that.

Medina said he felt the warning bells had not given the truck driver enough time to move out of the crossing.

The Star newspaper said the truck had been carrying 37,000 pounds of strawberries.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Ventura,CA,6,Oxnard,Unknown,Public,B,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,6,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,8,Unknown,3,Unknown,1,Unknown,0,2,Unknown,1,0,0,80,1,Unknown,0,2,Yes,Yes,Unknown,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown
