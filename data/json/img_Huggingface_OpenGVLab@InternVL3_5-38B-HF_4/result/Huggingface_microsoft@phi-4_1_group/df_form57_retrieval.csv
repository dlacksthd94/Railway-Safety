The train hit the motorcyclist in the area of Springlake Drive and Hesperian Boulevard.

The crash happened around 1:55 p.m. ACFD said another person was injured from the collision.

No other details were immediately available. KRON4 reached out to the San Leandro Police Department for more information about this collision. We are waiting for a response.

A motorcycle rider who witnessed the collision told KRON4 that a woman on the back of a motorcycle was struck and killed by an Amtrak train. The witness said the victim was part of a group of about 100 bikers who had gathered in San Jose for an organized ride.

“I’m still in the process of processing everything,” said Brandon Lupinek. “It’s pretty gruesome what I saw. We were trying to get past the train tracks, an Amtrak train was coming. Unfortunately, a couple of people lifted the Amtrak arms that come down to block the roadway. Most of everyone got through. There was one person last, and he hesitated before going. The bike got clipped by the train and the rear-end, he was carrying a passenger. We witnessed her body flying through the air. Her leg was cut off and her body was in half from the waist down. That’s a motorcyclist’s worst fear for a passenger to get injured, let alone go down with them on our bikes.”

SAN LEANDRO, CA, (February 23, 2025) - Julia Giovanna Rocca was tragically killed on Feb. 23 when the motorcycle that she was a passenger on was struck by an Amtrak train in San Leandro.

Julia Giovanna Rocca was tragically killed on Feb. 23 when the motorcycle that she was a passenger on was struck by an Amtrak train in San Leandro.


The motorcycle was hit at about 2 p.m. at a railroad crossing on Hesperian Boulevard near Springlake Drive. According to police, fellow riders lifted the railroad crossing arms before the collision. It is illegal in California to go around a railroad crossing. 
The accident remains under investigation.MOTORCYCLE CRASH INVESTIGATION
Motorcyclists must be even more cautious with a passenger on board and authorities are trying to determine what caused the bike to crash, resulting in the passenger being injured.
Per the National Safety Council (NSC), approximately 6,000 motorcyclists are killed each year in the U.S. Candice Bond, an experienced motorcycle accident attorney, noted that in cases such as this, it is imperative to have an independent investigation into the crash conducted by a seasoned lawyer to protect a victim’s rights.
“Insurance companies often try to pressure victims to settle for a quick payout for far less than the case is worth,” Bond, Managing Partner of Bond Legal, added. “They are financially motivated to limit compensation and do not factor in the long-term consequences and suffering those victims will ultimately experience. Attorneys vigorously advocate for their clients to ensure that they are treated with respect and compensated fairly.”
WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM
The family members of Julia Giovanna Rocca may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of companionship, pain, suffering, and emotional distress following a tragic or catastrophic accident.
“The stress and sorrow can be extremely overwhelming after losing a loved one in an accident,” said Stefano Formica, Of Counsel with Bond Legal. “We understand just what families are forced to go through, and protecting their rights is vital. A wrongful death lawyer will stay updated on the official investigation and help protect their legal rights and best interests.""

Authorities are investigating the death of a man who was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in northwest Berkeley on Tuesday morning.He was the second person to be killed in an Amtrak train fatality in Berkeley this month. The first incident took place Oct. 4 near the railway crossing with Harrison Street, according to media reports.On Tuesday, Amtrak said an individual who was trespassing on the track ""came into contact with the train"" around 9:15 a.m. near Gilman Street.As of publication time, he had been identified only as a man in his 40s. His name has not yet been released.

The train was traveling from Auburn, California, to San Jose, Amtrak said.""Amtrak is working with local law enforcement to investigate the incident. Train 529 resumed its journey shortly before noon,"" Amtrak said in a statement at 12:40 p.m.There were no reported injuries to the 77 passengers or crew on board. Trespassing on railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, followed by railroad-highway grade crossing incidents, Amtrak said.🚨The Berkeley Scanner was the first to report this incident.""These incidents can affect everyone involved,"" Amtrak said, ""those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers. They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and grade crossings."" Amtrak works with Operation Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI) to reduce train fatalities ""by emphasizing the obvious dangers of being on railroad property or disregarding warnings at rail crossings."" It was the second train fatality of the month in BerkeleyThe fatality earlier this month took place Oct. 4 when Amtrak train 545 was en route to Oakland from Sacramento at 5:35 p.m. The Alameda County coroner's office identified the victim from that incident as 56-year-old Selana Williams.In a story over the weekend, the Daily Californian said Williams, who was known as ""Sissy,"" had been unhoused since 2018 and was a beloved member of the People's Park community.For more information on railroad safety, visit StayOffTheTracks.org.This story was updated after publication with several additional details.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,10,19,2023,9,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Alameda,CA,06,Berkeley,Harrison Street,K,Pedestrian,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Amtrak train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Trespassing on the track,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Amtrak,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,44,1,Male,2,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,7,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,0,77,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,77,Yes,Unknown,77,No,No,"A man in his 40s was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in northwest Berkeley on Tuesday morning.

A person was clearing the train tracks of debris with a front loader when the train struck the front loader, Oakland fire spokesman Michael Hunt said. The victim was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.

“There was a big cloud of smoke and ran over there to see if anyone was in it,” said Tom, who heard the crash and quickly sprang into action. “Your first thought is that there is a human being in there and he has a family.”

He said the tractor driver suffered major injuries to his face and legs.

“I tried to reassure him that we had help on the way and to just hold on,” said Tom. “There was diesel all over the place, you could smell the gas.”

One hundred to 700 gallons of diesel fuel spilled when a tank on the train ruptured, Hunt said. He said the leak has been plugged.

“When crews got done assessing and evaluating, it appears 1 to 700 gallons of diesel had leaked out,” said Hunt. “Since then, the rupture have been closed.”

Tom said another tractor operator was also on scene and tried to warn his co-worker the train was coming but it was too late.

“One of the other workers said ‘oh, I tried to yell at him to hurry up because the arm was coming down and I told him please hurry, hurry and he just kept going’ the guy said the tractor was just going too slow and couldn’t make it,” said Tom.

OAKLAND, Calif. (KGO) -- An Amtrak train hit a truck in Oakland just before 9 a.m. Thursday, dragging it about 30 yards and immediately sparking a huge fire.

The driver of the truck and his passenger, a co-worker, were able to jump out of the truck before the impact. The driver, 73-year-old Javier Soria, said their truck was stuck on the track.

""All of a sudden, I saw that I got stuck and then I saw the (train) light and said 'Oh, my God.' I tried to go back and forward and he said, 'You have to get out of the truck, that train is going to hit you!' So I ran across the street and tried to stop the Amtrak - but no he wouldn't stop, he just kept going,"" Soria said, showing how he waved his arms in the hopes that the train operator would see him.

The crash happened at the intersection of Fruitvale Ave and E 10th in Oakland.

Soria and his co-worker were hauling garbage and were headed to the dump when he says the truck wheels got stuck on the track. He said he felt some panic but was calm enough to jump out of the truck in time.

EXCLUSIVE: Video shows fiery crash between train, truck in Oakland

Video captured the moment that a truck was struck by an Amtrak train in Oakland, causing the truck to explode into flames.

""The impact was terrible. I was worried about the Amtrak operator, he was in front, he is the one who hit it,"" Soria said.

An Amtrak spokesperson says the Amtrak Coast Starlight train 11 had 111 passengers and crew members on board. No one was hurt.

""All of a sudden it started slowing down, kind of a halt but not too abrupt,"" explained passenger Sonya Kotler. ""Everyone was safe. It wasn't too scary. And then they told us we hit some thing and we had to get off.""

While Sonya got off the train, most passengers remained on the train which continued on after the engines were swapped out.

The train was headed to Los Angeles from Seattle.

UNION CITY (CBS SF) - Two people in a small four-door car escaped injury Saturday night when the car's driver unwittingly turned onto railroad tracks in the path of an Amtrak train, the Alameda County Fire Department said.
The accident happened about 6 p.m. Saturday when the car, near the railroad crossing at Railroad and E Streets, turned onto the Union Pacific tracks into the path of an Amtrak Capital Corridor train. Fire Department spokesman Brian Centoni said the train hit the car from behind, and pushed the vehicle about 800 feet up the track before both came to a stop.

Photo: Frances Dinkelspiel
Janae Bell was standing on the Union Pacific railroad tracks around 8:10 p.m. Thursday talking with two friends, Jupiter and Fixie. A freight train was rushing past on one of the tracks, and the trio was waiting for it to pass before crossing at Hearst Avenue near Fourth Street in West Berkeley. They were eating some pastries from Peet’s Coffee.
All of a sudden, Bell looked up and noticed another train hurtling toward him and his friends. He didn’t have time to think. He jumped back and ran off the tracks, bringing his bicycle with him.
Within seconds, Bell turned around. His two friends were gone, run over by the Amtrak train.
“I looked up and saw the lights on the other train,” Bell said Friday, becoming visibly distraught at times while talking to a reporter. “I said, ‘Shit, train,’ and I took off running. When I looked around they were gone.”
The Alameda County coroner’s office on Monday released the name of the two men: Jason Clary, 37, with no fixed address and Jupiter Marley, 31, with no fixed address.
The men were killed Thursday night when they were struck by Train 717 on its way from Bakersfield to Oakland, according to Christina Leeds, a spokeswoman for Amtrak. (Amtrak had identified the train number as 550, which goes from San Jose to Auburn,  on its Twitter page Thursday night. Berkeleyside will seek clarification from Amtrak.)
Jupiter Marley, also known as “Jupiter of the Universe,” was 31, according to public records. Fixie was around 37, said Bell, who is 41. Both of the men who were killed had housed family in Berkeley, he said. They also both had girlfriends who lived on the street. Jupiter had a young daughter around 2.5 years old, said Bell.
After the train hit his friends, Bell was stunned. He wasn’t sure what to do so he returned to an area near Hearst and Second Street known as “the alley.” He had to break the news to his friends’ girlfriends.
“I couldn’t believe what had just happened,” said Bell. “It didn’t seem real to me.”
Some homeless advocates are wondering if recent actions by Caltrans might have upset the men’s equilibrium and in some way contributed to their deaths. Caltrans had just dismantled two nearby homeless encampments along University Avenue where the men were living, one Wednesday and one Thursday. The temperature reached into the high 80s on Thursday, leading Barbara Brust, a homeless advocate, to wonder if the two men killed had been dehydrated, tired and stressed, which led them to make bad judgments.
“Where do we go? Answer us!” #berkmtg #WhereDoWeGoBerkeley homeless persecution by CalTrans, BPD.— JP Massar (@jpmassar) September 13, 2019
Posting on Twitter, JP Massar shared a photograph of Andrea Henson on Thursday as she sat outside Berkeley city offices with signs about the men who died as part of the recently launched “Where do we go?” campaign supporting those experiencing homelessness. The sign included a reference to the hot weather.
But Bell said Jupiter and Fixie seemed good to him in the minutes before their deaths. Jupiter was drinking coffee and had those pastries; Fixie was riding his bike. Neither man was intoxicated, said Bell.
The two men had been living on the streets for at least three or so years, said Bell, who came from Las Vegas a few years ago after he had been shot five times by someone he didn’t know. Both of the men who were killed had been admired, he said.
“Fixie was amazing with bikes; he could fix anything,” said a woman who called herself J. That’s why he had the nickname “Fixie.”
“Jupiter was funny as hell, always goofing around, always smiling,” said J.
Bell said Fixie was “a true Irish dude,” a kind-hearted person who was a whiz on bikes. He was extremely generous, too. But like many living on the streets, something had happened to interrupt his life and hand him hard times, he said.
Jupiter was “the greatest,” said Bell. “He had so much love.”
Bell said the three men had climbed under the train crossing guards, which were down, although the alarms were no longer ringing. The freight train that was rushing by came every night at the same time and took 6-10 minutes to barrel through Berkeley. There isn’t usually another train there at the same time, said Bell.
They didn’t hear the train that struck Jupiter and Fixie, possibly because they were so used to the noise.
“It’s like white noise to us,” he said. “You hear the train all the time so your sensories don’t go off.”
Bell keeps replaying the scene in his head, over and over.
“I was the furthest away from the train,” he said. “I wonder, did they just freeze? Did they run into each other trying to run away? I don’t know. I wish it could all start over again and all of them could move with me.”
Update: Friends of Jason Clary mourned his death on Facebook. Clary was a former employee of the State Bicycle Co. and was a champion bicyclist.

The company put together a video five years ago of Clary riding through San Francisco. A friend made a tribute video of Clary riding his bike.
Marley’s friends are also posting about him on Facebook.

Here is a video that Marley posted to his Facebook page a number of months ago.
Update 9/16: The article was updated to include the full names of the two men killed.

LIVERMORE, Calif. (KGO) -- A driver was killed when an incoming ACE train hit his car Monday morning in Livermore.

It happened just before 8 a.m. at a railroad crossing that is about a quarter-of-a-mile from the Livermore ACE Train station.

Officials say it's early in this investigation, so they still don't have a clear picture of what happened. But according to witnesses, the car appeared to have been in the railroad crossing when it was hit.

According to Brian Schmidt, Director of Operations for ACE Train, investigators are still trying to figure where the car was hit. But he says, if the investigation finds that the driver was in railroad crossing after the crossing arms came down, it would have been difficult for the train to stop.

""It normally takes a passenger train anywhere from half-a-mile to three-quarters-of-a-mile to stop, depending on how fast they are going,"" says Schmidt, adding that the train was likely already slowing down as it approached the station.

He says trains travel about 45 mph, but speeds could be higher in areas where the train is traveling a straight section of tracks.

Justin Todd owns the nearby K.A.R. Service repair shop. He didn't see the accident, but was onhand as the body and car were removed from the intersection.

Todd says it is rare to hear of accident at this railroad crossing, in part because it is heavily patrolled by police.

""You see the police come by and make a big stink about people crossing the tracks, walking across when you are not in the cross walks,"" he explained. ""It seems pretty well regulated.""

But he says, if the investigation finds that the driver was in railroad crossing after the crossing arms came down, it would have been difficult for the train to stop. ""It normally takes a passenger train anywhere from half-a-mile to three-quarters-of-a-mile to stop, depending on how fast they are going,"" says Schmidt, adding that the train was likely already slowing down as it approached the station. He says trains travel about 45 mph, but speeds could be higher in areas where the train is traveling a straight section of tracks. Justin Todd owns the nearby K.A.R. Service repair shop. He didn't see the accident, but was onhand as the body and car were removed from the intersection. Todd says it is rare to hear of accident at this railroad crossing, in part because it is heavily patrolled by police. ""You see the police come by and make a big stink about people crossing the tracks, walking across when you are not in the cross walks,"" he explained. ""It seems pretty well regulated."" Livermore police say the crossing arms, the lights and sounds were functioning properly.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Two members of the veteran Oakland R&B-funk band Tower of Power were in critical condition Thursday night after being struck by an Amtrak train near Jack London Square shortly before 8pm, according to several sources including a band spokesperson. They were scheduled to perform two sets at Yoshi’s, the jazz club that borders the transit hub, and a venue where the band plays regularly.

“In an unfortunate accident tonight, two members of the award-winning group Tower Of Power, drummer David Garibaldi and current bassist Marc Van Wageningen, were struck by a train in California,” said their publicist, Jeremy Westby, in a statement. “Both men are responsive and being treated at a local hospital in Oakland.”

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the accident occurred when Garibaldi, Van Wageningen, and two other pedestrians tried to cross the train tracks while the guard arms were down, possibly because they thought the warning was for a slow freight train that had just passed. An Amtrak train was coming at about 25 mph from the other direction on a different track, Oakland Police Sgt. Aaron Smith told the Chronicle. The other two people were apparently able to jump out of the way before the two musicians were struck.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- A Capitol Corridor train hit two musicians just before 8 p.m. on Embarcadero West and Washington Street in Oakland's Jack London Square, right next to Oakland music venue, Yoshi's.

According to an Amtrak spokesperson, David Garibaldi and Marc Van Wageningen were not in the designated crosswalk when they were hit.

Garibaldi is one of the original members of East Bay R &B group Tower of Power. Van Wageningen was just filling in for their concert Thursday.



""I'm shook up like all in the industry hearing about it,"" said friend Victor Pamiroyan. ""And I hope the injuries, I don't know what the injuries are.""

Both men were rushed to Highland Hospital. Meantime, at Yoshi's, Thursday's shows were immediately cancelled as word spread about the tragedy on the train tracks.

Friends can't believe what happened. ""To study and get to know him was a dream come true,"" said Ryan Glick. ""I though I would never study with the best drummer in the world and I got to.""

RELATED: Tower of Power band members hit by train in serious condition

There are two train crossings by Yoshi's jazz club at Jack London Square for pedestrians, and for cars. There's even a pedestrian bridge over the tracks, but two members of the Tower of Power band ran out of their hotel just before their 8 p.m. started and apparently tried to jaywalk over the tracks along with several others.

A freight train passed, then they ran out and were struck by another oncoming Amtrak train.

Drummer David Garibaldi was rushed to Highland Hospital with face and head injuries according to a Facebook post by the Tower of Power band leader, who also said fill-in bassist Marc Van Wageningen made it through surgery for internal bleeding. Both are in critical condition.

Yoshi's cancelled the band's last two performances in Oakland and fans were stunned. ""I grew up listening to them,"" said Marlena Aying. ""And listening to them this morning on the way in, great music for decades so hearing about the accident, it's very sad.""

""At every crossing there's bars that come down. The lights start to flash as the trains approach, they blow the horns,"" said Dean Agmata who works at Jack London Square.

Those who live and work down here say it's hard to imagine not noticing the warnings of an oncoming train.

Some are wondering whether construction in the area contributed to the accident on Washington Avenue.

Police caution is it is never safe to stop on train tracks, but there was construction in the area where PG &E crews were inspecting a gas pipeline.

Some are worried that created an unusual traffic backup that may have contributed to Tuesday's deadly accident. ""We're all going there someday, but it wasn't their time,"" one man said.

Less than 24 hours after two of his family members were killed, Juan Colmenero returned to grieve and wonder, if somehow this could have been prevented. ""They should have more security right here on these tracks because people come and go, it's devastating,"" Colmenero said.

Vanessa Henriquez, 30, and her daughter Saidy Henriquez, 3, were killed when an Amtrak train plowed into their SUV on Washington Avenue.

A PG &E crew was working in the area and had signs out funneling traffic down to one lane, just past the train crossing.

Henriquez' SUV was backed up in traffic, it's front end was apparently on the tracks when the crossing gates lowered and the train approached. ""There were cars on the track and all the way up to the light,"" Lilla Magee said.

Magee had driven south on Washington Avenue and was stopped in nearly the same spot just two hours earlier. ""Honestly, before this crash even, I just had this feeling like this is bad. You really have to be on your toes to not get caught on the tracks,"" she said.

According to San Leandro police, PG &E had a permit and a city inspector had signed off on the utility's traffic management plan. ""We do send inspectors out on a daily basis to make sure those permits are in full compliance and yesterday the proper signage for the traffic management plan were properly posted,"" San Leandro Police Department Lt. Robert McManus said.

PG &E offered condolences to the Henriquez family and issued a statement saying: ""While the incident is currently under investigation by local authorities, at this point, this incident doesn't appear to be directly related to any pG &E work in the area.""",Amtrak,PG &E,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2023,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Alameda,CA,06,San Leandro,Washington Avenue,E,SUV,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Amtrak train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Amtrak,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Gates,Gates,A,Dry,1,Both sides,1,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,2,Female,2,No,4,Stopped on crossing,3,Unknown,6,Highway vehicles,2,Unknown,2,0,Unknown,1,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,No,No,"Some are wondering whether construction in the area contributed to a deadly train accident that killed a mother and her toddler in San Leandro Tuesday.

San Leandro police identified the victims as 30-year-old Vanessa Henriquez and her 3-year-old daughter, Saidy.
San Leandro Police Department spokesman Lt. Robert McManus said the SUV was parked on the track on the other side of the guardrail. ""There is a construction zone which could have created some confusion,"" McManus said. Both mother and child died on impact, he said.
The family was in shock Tuesday. Jose Nelson Portillo confirmed to NBC Bay Area that it was his sister-in-law and niece in the SUV. He said the family has a boy with autism, and Hernriquez was on her way to pick him up.

One witness said the conductor tried to stop the train and was concerned when he got closer to the wreckage.
""I went down there, and the conductor came out of the train,"" said Weston Pokorny. ""He said, 'Please tell me people got out of the car.' He was checking the train. I said no one got out of the car.""
There were no injuries to the 39 people on board, Amtrak said. All passengers were transported by bus to an Amtrak station to continue on to Sacramento.

The maximum train speed in that area is 79 mph, but it was not immediately known how fast the train was going, Amtrak said.
""I don’t know what speeds the Amtrak train was traveling at but do know that as they pass these rail passings they do go at a very high rate of speed which would explain why that car was trapped in the tracks,"" McManus said.
Emergency crews and paramedics could be spotted at the scene of the crash, which showed the SUV trapped underneath the train.
""The train basically dragged the car all the way down - it stopped pretty fast, but it was too late,"" a man who was eating lunch at a nearby restaurant told NBC Bay Area. ""I suddenly turned around and heard this impact ... Wham!""
According to police, the train pushed the SUV to what appears to be an eight and a quarter of a mile down the train tracks.
""I heard the screeching and then bang,"" said Western Pokorny, who spoke with the conductor moments after the crash.
""He said, 'Please tell me they got out of the vehicle.' I said, 'No one got out the of the vehicle they are gone.'""
On Monday, a man was hit and killed by an Amtrak train traveling from San Jose to Sacramento in San Leandro, officials said. Train No. 528 was traveling from San Jose to Sacramento when it struck the man around 10:30 a.m. near Davis Street and Orchard Avenue, Amtrak said.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) -- A mother and her toddler were killed when an Amtrak train slammed into their SUV in the East Bay.

The incident happened Tuesday afternoon on Washington Avenue and Halcyon Drive in San Leandro at around 1:30 p.m.

The Alameda County coroner identified the mother and daughter as 30-year-old Vannessa Henriquez and 3-year-old Saidy.

Police say Henriquez of Oakland was in that SUV with her 3 year old daughter, Saidy.

Jose Portillo, a relative, says the family is devastated he calls Henriquez a dedicated, hard-working mom. He says she was on her way to pick up her son, who has autism, but she didn't arrive, and police were called.

The Amtrak Capitol Corridor Train No. 532 had 39 passengers on board and was heading northbound from San Jose to Sacramento when it crashed into the dark SUV with a woman and young child inside. Officials said none of the passengers aboard the train were injured.

The SUV was caught on the tracks with no way to escape. ""It appears that the vehicle that was struck today was trapped in traffic. It was stuck there prior to the railroad arms going down and was unable to get off the tracks safely before it was impacted at a high rate of speed by the Amtrak train,"" San Leandro Police Department Lt. Bob McManus said.

""I have two kids, and it just hurts my heart you know,"" said San Leandro resident Jackie Moniz.

Moniz said she's always careful near this rail crossing.

On Monday, a pedestrian was struck and killed by a train less than a mile from the site of Tuesday's crash.

Henriquez and her daughter are a sad, sobering reminder about danger on the tracks.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) -- Monday evening a teenage girl on her cellphone stepped into the path of an oncoming train. It happened at Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive in San Leandro.

ABC7 News has covered train fatalities at the same railroad crossing before, but this victim lived in a bottom floor apartment across the street. You would think she would be highly aware of the dangers, but even we were surprised at how quickly the train flies through the area. You cannot afford to be distracted.

Brittney Silva, 18, routinely crossed these train tracks, next to her home at Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive. But this time witnesses say the senior at San Leandro High School was distracted.

Witness Cindy Lu says her friend tried to warn her. She said, ""He yelled. He screamed so loud, he was nervous, he screamed so loud, but she doesn't hear because she had a phone to her ear.""

Cynthia Silva, Brittney's mother, told ABC7 News, ""She wanted to be an OBGYN. She wanted to help bring babies into this world."" She says her daughter was the strong one in a home where she admits they had challenges. She said the things she would miss most were: ""her smile, her hugs, her, the way she used to soothe me when I was upset.""



""She turned her grades around and made it possible. She got into UC Santa Cruz and she got into Humboldt, and Cal State East Bay. Just a few years ago that wouldn't have been possible,"" San Leandro High School assistant principal Elisa Alvarez said.

Just last month, a car crashed into the Silva's apartment, shaving off their balcony.

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (KGO) -- A high school senior lost her life because she was distracted by her cellphone and her grieving mother has a message.

A train quickly sped by and 18-year-old Brittney Silva did not get out of the way. The accident happened next to her home in San Leandro on Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive.

Witnesses say she had earbuds on and when they yelled out a warning, there was no reaction. She couldn't hear it.

Brittney's mother, Cynthia Silva, said, ""I need her to come back and I need these youngsters to take their headphones out of their dang ears. She was listening to music. She had both of her headphones in and she was texting.""



Cynthia showed us what she thinks happened to her daughter Brittney as the teen walked across the train tracks near their San Leandro home just before 6 p.m. Monday night.

""And she's looking down like this and you can't see the arms come down behind her. And the arms came down behind her, she had her headphones in and she couldn't hear the train coming,"" said Cynthia.

Brittney died instantly when an Amtrak train hit her at a high speed on at the intersection of Hesperian Boulevard and Springlake Drive, just a few yards from her family's apartment. Because of the earbuds, Brittney didn't hear a witness yell for her to get out of the way.

Cynthia made a public plea to other young people, ""I will tell all of the other youngsters out there. When you're walking down the street, and you've got your headphones on, keep one headphone in and one out so you can hear the world around you.""

Brittney was a senior at San Leandro High school, all set to go to the prom this weekend and graduate in June.

""She was just always so nice and complimenting people all the people all the time. She's so outgoing and loving. This is such a tragic thing to happen for someone who is so special,"" said Lilian McLean, a friend.

At San Leandro High, students signed a big sheet of paper with their condolences to Brittney's family, including her mother and 11-year-old sister.

""Everyone loved her, everyone knew her, she would always dance and she would always give me great advice about life,"" said Melody Silva, Brittney's sister.

Remembering Sam Raushenbush
Friends and family are invited to share memories of the young man who died in a train accident Friday morning.
Bright, funny, and gregarious, Sam Raushenbush, 20, lived life against the grain, according to his older brother, Nick.
""Sam knew how to be happy, which was to just go and do whatever he wanted to do.""
Sam Raushenbush died Friday morning, when he was struck by an while he was apparently spraying graffiti in the area with a friend. It was his 20th birthday, which he had planned to celebrate later with friends at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Sam grew up in San Diego and later Piedmont, where his father, Richard Raushenbush is currently a member of the school board.
From Berkeley to Cochella, across the country, and even traveling abroad in Italy, Sam touched lives everywhere he went with his energy and humor. Nick said Sam's Facebook page was ""streaming"" yesterday with non-stop posts from hundreds of friends mourning their loss.
Sam's mother died when he was 11, and he had struggled with addiction as a teen, but, said Nick, ""he came out on top.""
He had delivered a hilarious speech as the class speaker for the class of 2009 at the Oakley School, a therapeutic boarding school in Utah, and had been accepted to UC Santa Cruz, his dream college.
Sam recently wrote a candid column for the Huffington Post about his decision to move to Berkeley after his freshman year to take time off from college and experience the ""real world"" after getting caught up in the party scene.
He wanted to spend this year close to his family, but had planned to return to Santa Cruz next fall. He was looking forward to a career in writing, interviewing hip hop for a music blog.
A big Golden Gate Warriors fan, Sam played basketball weekly in San Ramon. He'd played ultimate frisbee and made it to the state championships with his high school cross country team.
Sam's short life, Nick said, ""It's an epic tale. ... He packed more into his life than most people can in a hundred. This kid was a rock star and that's how he should be remembered.""
Along with his many friends, Sam leaves behind his father Richard, step-mother Barbara Giuffre, brother Nick, and ten-year-old half-sister Genevieve.
A memorial service and celebration has been scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 10. All the details have been posted here: http://patch.com/E-ZS7

A woman escaped without injury after her vehicle became stuck at a railroad crossing in eastern Contra Costa County as a train was approaching Sunday, officials said.Shortly after 5:30 p.m., officers were called to the tracks near Big Break Road and Main Street after the vehicle was struck by the train. When police arrived, they found the woman near the crash site.According to officers, the woman, who was the only occupant of the vehicle, said the vehicle began experiencing problems as she approached the tracks. The woman drove off the road at one set of tracks and became stuck on the tracks.Soon after, the woman saw the approaching train, which prompted her to leave the vehicle. Police said the woman's vehicle had ""major damage"" from the train strike.It does not appear that intoxication played a role in the collision, police said. The investigation has been turned over to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway police.


Police reminded drivers to ensure they have cleared railroad tracks when driving near the tracks. Drivers were also urged to keep the BNSF Resource Operations Call Center number, 1-800-832-5442, in their contacts.

Three people were killed and two others injured after an Amtrak train crashed into a vehicle obstructing rail tracks near Brentwood, California, on Sunday, officials said.

The East Contra Costa County Fire Protection District said the incident was reported at around 1 p.m. after a car carrying five people was struck by a train while attempting to cross the tracks at an unprotected railroad crossing.

Three people in the car were killed at the scene, while two others, including a child, were injured, the fire service told NBC's KNTV, based in San Jose, California. One person was flown to hospital via air ambulance, while the child was transported to the same hospital over ground, it said.

The crash killed three, with an adult and a child taken to hospital with injuries. NBC Bay Area

The fire service said the Contra Costa Sheriff's office was handling an investigation into the deadly incident.

In a statement shared with NBC News, Amtrak confirmed train 713 had ""made contact with a vehicle that was obstructing the track in Knightsen.""

It said there were no reported injuries to the 89 passengers or crew onboard the train. The train was delayed for around three hours while authorities investigated the incident, Amtrak said.

The company said it was working with local law enforcement and BNSF Railway, the track owner, to investigate the incident.

Amtrak did not directly comment on the fatalities related to the incident.

However, it said that trespassing along railroad rights-of-way was the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, while railroad crossing incidents were the second leading cause, citing the Federal Railroad Administration.

""These incidents can affect everyone involved — those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers,"" Amtrak said.

""They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and crossings,"" it said.

Two people were killed in Houston in April after the car they were in crashed into an Amtrak train after the driver attempted to beat the train at a railroad crossing, according to police.

In that crash, the driver of the vehicle drove around the crossing arms signaling an approaching train, before colliding with the train, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

OAKLEY, Contra Costa County (CBS SF) -- A freight train hit a vehicle on the tracks in Oakley Wednesday, killing a 12-year-old boy and critically injuring a woman.
The collision happened at about 12:53 p.m. at a railroad crossing at E. Cypress Road just east of Main St.
A 19-year-old woman was airlifted to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek with critical injuries while three other people were taken by ambulance to area hospitals, according to Fire Marshal Steve Aubert with the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District.
On Wednesday afternoon, Oakley Union Elementary School District Superintendent Jeff Palmquist said in a letter to parents that the victim was a student at Delta Vista Middle School, a block away from the railroad crossing.
A witness said it appeared a grey Lexus SUV tried to beat the train after the railroad crossing arms were coming down and was struck in the rear portion of the vehicle. At least one other vehicle was hit in the collision.

The shaken witness said she was in a truck one vehicle away from the crash directly in front of her.
""As the car went through the gates went down and its ass end was still sitting in the train tracks. The train went through and then all of a sudden I just heard a big crunch and I looked over and the car flew off the road and then the tires were going and there was debris hitting my truck - and I called 9-1-1,"" said the unidentified witness. ""It was sickening. Just scary.""
Another witness said he also saw the crash from inside his own vehicle.
""I saw a big cloud of dust and then I saw the train come to a grinding halt, and then everybody got out and started - it was obviously some attention being paid,"" said witness Edward Harris. ""So I get up and got out of my car and I looked and I saw the SUV sitting there. Everything had just happened so we all got out and I called 9-1-1.""
Harris said he thought about his own children after learning of the young victim involved in the crash.
It's heartbreaking. I've got children who go to school right over here at Delta Vista [Middle School],"" he said. ""I heard that there was a younger person that was reportedly involved and my heart just goes out to the family and I'm just praying for them. ""
LaQuan Ashford, who has a child at Delta Vista told KPIX 5, ""I go stand at that track and wait for my daughter to cross because of that reason. There's always a train crossing during their school time.""
Ashford said train traffic is such a problem that he has reached out to have the city set some limits on trains coming through the area, especially during pick up and drop off hours.
""There is a long line all the way across. So everyone is sitting bumper to bumper waiting to get to this light,"" Ashford said. ""So the train, coming at that time, anyone can get stuck on the track. Anyone, at any given time.""
Oakley city officials said they have implemented road striping changes and adjusted the timing of the traffic signals to ease congestion.
The East Contra Costa Fire Protection District treated three other victims and released them at the scene.
It was the third train crash in East Contra Costa County this year and the second in one week. On Aug. 20, an Amtrak passenger train collided with a big rig in Brentwood resulting in a minor injury. In May, a truck parked on the tracks was hit by a train in Orwood, resulting in an injury to the driver.
""If the crossing arms are down, don't ever try to beat a train. They're down for a reason,"" said ECCFPD Battalion Chief Ross Macumber. ""The train comes through at a high rate of speed and they don't stop for a long time. So never try to beat a train, never drive around the crossing arm, and if it's an uncontrolled train intersection, always turn off your radio, roll down your window and listen and look before you cross.""",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,12,13,2023,12,PM,Unknown,Unknown,Contra Costa County,CA,06,Oakley,E.

""As the car went through the gates went down and its ass end was still sitting in the train tracks. The train went through and then all of a sudden I just heard a big crunch and I looked over and the car flew off the road and then the tires were going and there was debris hitting my truck - and I called 9-1-1,"" said the unidentified witness. ""It was sickening. Just scary."" Another witness said he also saw the crash from inside his own vehicle. ""I saw a big cloud of dust and then I saw the train come to a grinding halt, and then everybody got out and started - it was obviously some attention being paid,"" said witness Edward Harris. ""So I get up and got out of my car and I looked and I saw the SUV sitting there. Everything had just happened so we all got out and I called 9-1-1."" Harris said he thought about his own children after learning of the young victim involved in the crash. It's heartbreaking. I've got children who go to school right over here at Delta Vista [Middle School],"" he said. ""I heard that there was a younger person that was reportedly involved and my heart just goes out to the family and I'm just praying for them. "" LaQuan Ashford, who has a child at Delta Vista told KPIX 5, ""I go stand at that track and wait for my daughter to cross because of that reason. There's always a train crossing during their school time."" Ashford said train traffic is such a problem that he has reached out to have the city set some limits on trains coming",,,

Aug. 26—OAKLEY, CA — A collision between multiple vehicles and a freight train killed a 12-year-old boy and critically injured a 19-year-old girl Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.
At 12:53 p.m., East Contra Costa Fire Protection District firefighters responded to the railroad crossing at East Cypress Road and Main Street for a report of a collision involving a freight train and three vehicles, battalion chief Steve Aubert said.
According to Oakley police who also responded to the scene, one vehicle had overturned, with at least one victim suffering from head trauma and in and out of consciousness.
After firefighters arrived and began assisting, the 12-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. The boy's mother, Melissa Schaefer, spoke to this news organization at the scene and identified him as Joshua Schaefer.
The 19-year-old was flown by REACH medical helicopter to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek and preliminarily listed in critical condition.
The Oakley Union Elementary School District's board of trustees offered ""our deepest sympathies to the family, the Delta Vista School community, and school communities throughout the district who are impacted by the tragedy that occurred earlier today,"" an e-mailed statement read in part Wednesday night. ""The district's crisis management team is providing counseling and bereavement support services, on-site, to our students and staff to help everyone cope with the events of today.""
This is the second train-vehicle collision East Contra Costa firefighters have responded to within a week, after an Amtrak train out of Stockton struck a semi tractor-trailer at an Orwood Road crossing just after 2:45 p.m. last Friday. That truck's driver escaped with minor injury, while no one aboard the train was injured.

The incident occurred near the intersection of East Cypress Road and Main Street at 12:53 p.m.

“All of a sudden I just heard a big crunch and I looked over and the car flew off the road and then tires were going and then debris was hitting my truck,” a witness said.

The 12-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene and the 19-year-old driver of the vehicle was transported to John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek to be treated for serious injuries.

According to the boy’s family, his 19-year-old half-sister had just picked him up from school.

""Scott was very funny, extremely intelligent and well-respected,"" Marag said. ""His compassion, professionalism and unwavering commitment to public service made a lasting impact on all who had the privilege to know and work alongside him.""

Sherman joined Randolph Police in 2002, Marag said. He made sergeant in 2022. His assignments spanned from working with young people to aiding elders. He served the Randolph Public Schools as a school resource officer and was also the department's elder affairs officer, Marag said.

Patrolled Randolph High School, among other roles

Sherman's roles included patrolling Randolph High School, according to a 2008 profile in the Quincy Patriot Ledger. According to that story, he was from Quincy and would have become a lawyer if he hadn't gone into public safety. ""I try to keep the students from making mistakes that affect their futures, both academically and personally,"" he said in 2008, adding that he liked to use humor to defuse situations.

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- A Tenaya Middle School football coach is being remembered by his family and colleagues.

Patrick Gossett's life was cut tragically short after he was hit by a train near Fig Garden Loop Park just days after his 27th birthday.

His mom, Christina Torrez describes the support she's been receiving since she lost her son on May 3.

""That support and that love for my son it just -- I love my son to death and to see so many people showing love. That's my son,"" said Torrez.

One of Gossett's great passions was football.

""He loved coaching. He didn't have kids, so those kids were his kids,"" said Gina Torrez, Gossett's aunt.

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- A Fresno family was almost to their destination Tuesday night - Christmas Tree Lane - when the back of their minivan was struck by a six-car Amtrak train near the intersection of Shields and Wishon.

RELATED: 5-year-old child killed in train crash while family waited to enter Christmas Tree Lane

The force of the crash killed a 5-year-old boy, identified by the Fresno County Sheriff's Office as Anton Solorio.

On Wednesday, area residents were still in shock, trying to understand what went wrong on the tracks.

""To hear something like this, it's a rip in the fabric of our universe,"" says John Alden.

Adds Debi Ruud:

""We couldn't even imagine how it can happen.""

The cause of the crash is still under investigation.

But Fresno Police say it appears the railroad signals were working at the time and that the train engineer applied the brakes and used the horn.

They believe the boy's mother was driving the van and simply thought she had cleared the tracks when she hadn't.

""It's a tragedy, it's an unnecessary loss of life, and it's something that's absolutely avoidable so we just need to remind motorists about safety,"" says Fresno Police Deputy Chief Michael Reid.

JD Sanders lives nearby, and is still processing what he saw and heard last night, hoping it never happens again.

""I ran down there and heard the mother screaming and I had to come back to my house because it was too much for me,"" he says. ""It's pretty terrible.""

Sanders called 911, and by the time he went back outside, police were everywhere.

The boy's mother, who is pregnant, was brought to the hospital to get checked out.

His grandmother and younger sibling were in the car too and also expected to be ok.

On Wednesday, Valerie Espinoza stopped by the scene to pay her respects to the little boy who passed away.

""I just came to bring some balloons because I felt very bad for the child, you know he's a baby,"" she said.

She also shared an important reminder for all families.

""Just cherish life because life is so precious.""

Fresno Police are reminding everyone that trains pass through the intersection frequently, and that they move fast, and take a long time to stop.

The train was going at approximately 70 miles per hour.

MERCED, Calif. (KFSN) -- A Merced mother is dealing with more heartache after her late son's memorial cross was stolen.

Rosalinda Vega says the cross had her son's name on it. It was placed steps from where he was killed, next to flowers on a hill.

Someone stole it on Tuesday, leaving her heartbroken.

""It's hard coming home every day and knowing your son is not here,"" Vega says.

She says the pain doesn't get any easier.

Candles sit next to photos of her son, 13-year-old Vicente Mancera.

The young boy was a Hoover middle school student, captain of the wrestling team, and excited to start the 8th grade.

But that all came to a tragic end in May when her son was hit and killed by a train on his way back home from school.

""You try to do for the rest of your children, but it's hard when you're missing one,"" she says.

Her source of solace was a memorial near the train tracks, marked by a handmade cross with the young boy's name on it and a lightning bolt symbolizing his favorite superhero - The Flash.

But on Tuesday, after the cross was stolen, there was a new feeling of pain.

""I was hurt someone would do that, it's very disrespectful. For me it was more important to put that there to have the future kids walk under the bridge versus over the bridge, help avoid this pain for another parent,"" she says.

She says she called both Merced city and county officials, and was told neither of them took it down.

Vega says the cross keeps her son's memory alive, remembering the boy taken from her too soon.

""He always overcame anything he put his mind to. That's what made him so great,"" she says.

All she wants now is for whoever took the cross to put it back.

KINGSBRIDGE, Bronx -- A man is dead and his 5-year-old daughter was injured after police say he jumped in front of a moving train in the Bronx while holding onto her.

It happened before 8 a.m. Monday at Jerome Avenue and West Kingsbridge Road in the Kingsbridge section.

Police say the 45-year-old man jumped onto the tracks while holding his daughter and was hit by a southbound 4 train. Medics pronounced him dead at the scene.

Sources say the child was not hit by the train. She was taken to Jacobi Medical Center to be treated for scratches.

Two other people were also treated. They may have jumped onto the tracks to help the young girl.

But it was too late and witnesses say the man jumped onto the tracks with his little girl. Amazingly the child found a safe spot and was not seriously hurt.

Cellphone video captured good Samaritans helping the frightened child get back up onto the platform.

Not all the musings of these residents have been as bucolic as one might expect. Rachel Monroe of Marfa, Tex., wrote of her experience on Twitter:

“This Amtrak writing residency thing has been cool, except for when the train I’m on just killed someone.”

(A fatal accident involving a train was reported in Fresno, Calif., that day.)

The Mall, for its part, is inviting “a special scribe” to “spend five days deeply immersed in the mall atmosphere while writing on-the-fly impressions in their own words.”

Before midnight Central time on March 10, applicants can submit their pitch in 150 or fewer words, after which 25 semifinalists will be invited to expand on their ideas in a 500- to 800-word essay.

“Would it be a personal story? A blow-by-blow account of your experiences? The mall as seen through the eyes of a first-time tourist or a regular guest?” the contest asks. “Heck, if you can make the assignment work as a musical-comedy screenplay, by all means make it so!”

The goal of the contest, according to the mall’s news release cited by The Star Tribune, “is to come away from this project with an evocative story about Mall of America that represents the contemporary guest experience after 25 years of evolution as a leading retail and entertainment establishment.”",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Fresno County,CA,06,Fresno,Unknown,K,Pedestrian,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Public,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,No,Unknown,Unknown,No,No,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- Adrian Loza's family says the 29-year-old cook was always there, whether you needed a friend, or a great meal.

On the GoFundMe page they've set up for him, a family member says, ""Many knew Adrian for his vibrant personality, his kind heart, and of course, his love of food and cooking.""

He died Saturday after being hit by a train in Fresno County. Authorities say he was jogging on the tracks with headphones on. He likely didn't hear or see the train. ""Everybody really just loved Adrian,"" said Fresno Grizzlies General Manager Derek Franks. ""He touched a lot of people in what he did, and he'll be missed by many.""

He connected to the community through cooking authentic Mexican food at his family's restaurant El Premio Mayor. He also cooked on their taco truck, at events like Gazebo Gardens and the Fresno Grizzlies Taco Truck Throwdown. It was a family affair, but Franks says Adrian was the face of the truck. ""He's an easy guy to get behind, an easy guy to vote for based on just his personality and his passion,"" Franks said.

Franks also said they had tastier tacos than the rest, and that lead Loza and his family to winning the Throwdown twice, in 2012, and 2015. Franks says the Grizzlies have been in touch with Loza's family, who assure them they're keeping their restaurants open. The Grizzlies just hope they can compete again in the sixth Taco Truck Throwdown-- this time, in Loza's honor.

Franks says they are working on ways to team up with other organizations to honor Loza in the near future.

Adrian Loza, right, receives the Taco Truck Throwdown trophies after his family business wins the annual Fresno Grizzlies event last August. Loza died Jan. 23 after he was struck by a train. Special to The Bee

A popular member of Fresno’s local food truck scene and the winner of last year’s Fresno Grizzlies Taco Truck Throwdown died on Jan. 23 after he was hit by a train while jogging near his home in Fresno County.

The death of Adrian Loza, 29, shocked his family and friends over the weekend. The Fresno Grizzlies and Gazebo Gardens, where Loza often manned his mother’s food truck, shared remembrances on social media after learning of the accident.

Loza’s younger sister, Bianca, said he was training for a marathon. He ran a similar 6-mile route each day.

Loza’s mother, Belén Ramírez, owns two El Premio Mayor brick-and-mortar restaurants and one food truck. She first started the business nearly 20 years ago.

In August, the mobile El Premio Mayor beat out 22 other taco trucks in both the judges’ and people’s choice competitions at the annual Grizzlies event, which drew a record-breaking crowd of nearly 17,000 people.

Loza’s family has set up a Go Fund Me page to help pay for funeral expenses. As of Wednesday night, it had raised nearly $5,000 of its $12,000 goal.

FRESNO, Calif. -- Authorities are investigating a deadly crash involving an Amtrak train and a van in Fresno County. The crash happened around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday near Conejo and Peach avenues.

The California Highway Patrol has confirmed that two men were killed. Officers say both men were riding in the van, when it attempted to cross the train tracks and was hit by the train.

An Amtrak spokesperson says the train, 702 San Joaquin, left from Sacramento and was headed to Bakersfield with a stop in Hanford scheduled. The train was delayed for a few hours before continuing to the South Valley.



The CHP says none of the 181 passengers on board was hurt in the crash, but investigators were checking the area to make sure no one else was in the van who may have been ejected during the collision.

The cause of the crash is unclear at this point. Some roadways in the area are shut down as the investigation continues.

An organization that provides services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Investigators say the railroad crossing arms were down, but the van ran through them and onto the tracks. A statement released by Bethesda Lutheran Communities says in part: ""Our prayers and deepest condolences go out to both families and to those that knew Michael and Nicholas. Bethesda has deployed staff ministry consultants to be available to support anyone at the Fresno program or throughout the organization who requires comfort.""",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

National Transportation Safety Board investigators have determined that the truck involved in the Metrolink train crash in Oxnard was not stuck on the tracks as initially believed.

OXNARD, Calif. -- National Transportation Safety Board investigators have determined that the truck involved in the Metrolink train crash in Oxnard was not stuck on the tracks as initially believed.

""Our information is the collision occurred about 80 feet down the railroad track toward Oxnard. It had to travel there somehow. It was not stuck, bottomed out on the track or something like that, it had actually traveled down the railroad track itself,"" said Robert Sumwalt with the National Transportation Safety Board.

About 2,100 crossing accident occur each year, but Tuesday's derailment drew NTSB attention because the truck was found having driven down the tracks. Investigators are expected to remain on scene for five to seven days.

""Our objective is to collect perishable evidence,"" Sumwalt added. ""We are not here to speculate. We never speculate at the NTSB. We're not here on scene to determine the cause of the accident. We're not here on scene to analyze. I know everybody wants to know what happened, and we will determine that, but our goal here is to collect that information that will go away with the passage of time.""

As part of the investigation, NTSB plans to do a sight distance test, which means they will set up a mock situation to see how far down the track each person could actually see from both the train and pickup truck.

The NTSB is also looking at video and data equipment on the train that should reveal the moments before the crash.

Information from the control cab showed the train engineer managed to hit the brakes early, but could not avoid the crash.

Ramirez's lawyer Ron Bamieh called the collision an ""accident."" Ramirez was driving his company's truck and trailer. He has been employed by the same produce trucking company, The Grower's Company, Inc., for 12 years.

""The arrest of Mr. Ramirez is the unfortunate result of law enforcement attempting to cast blame on a man who was caught in a tragic situation with no way to stop the oncoming tragedy. He does not know how or why the truck he was driving stopped on the tracks, and wishes there was something he could have done to prevent this accident,"" Bamieh said.

Bamieh added that his office's investigation showed that Ramirez's truck did become ""entangled and unable to move off the railroad tracks. The truck and the trailer were somehow stuck.""

About 50 people were on board. Twenty-eight people were taken to a hospital, including four in critical condition. No fatalities were reported.

On Wednesday, clean-up efforts continued. All derailed cars had been removed from scene. Track repairs and crossing light and arm function checks were ongoing. Authorities were hoping to get the site cleaned up by the end of the day.

Commuting around the area

Delays were expected for commuters traveling near the crash area.

Metrolink riders for Ventura County Line Trains 102, 104 and 106 will be bused around the crash site between the Camarillo, Oxnard or Ventura-East stations and the Moorpark station. Regularly scheduled service resumes for passengers traveling between Los Angeles Union Station and Moorpark station.

Jenna Betti, an 8th grader at Martinez Junior High School, was remembered at a candlelight vigil as a great soccer player, a great friend and for her contagious smile.

""Heaven gained one of the most beautiful angels and she is now in a better place protected by God,"" said Julia Betti, Jenna's sister.

A social media post by Jenna's mother said the teen was killed by a train while trying to retrieve her dropped cell phone.

Jenna was hit around 5 p.m. Sunday on the railroad tracks near Old Orchard and Howe roads. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe train that struck her was heading from Richmond to Fresno, and had three crewmembers aboard at the time of the incident, a railway spokeswoman said.

The spokeswoman said Jenna and another person were on the tracks but moved away as the train approached. The girl then returned to the tracks and was hit.

According to a Facebook message from Jenna's mother, Dena Betti, that was reposted on social media sites, Jenna was with her boyfriend on the tracks just before she was hit. The mother wrote that Jenna apparently dropped her phone and was killed when she went back to grab it as the train approached.

Tuesday's vigil was held near the location of where Jenna died.

Grief counselors were at the school Tuesday and will remain there all this week, a campus secretary said.

 

 On social media, messages about Jenna have been pouring in since her death. One poster, who appears to be Jenna's boyfriend, wrote, ""She is so important to me and I am just devastated. I love her so much.""

 

 Jenna has two younger sisters and played club soccer. Her mother was involved in her daughters' school communities, according to the Martinez Unified School District superintendent.

(KERO) — Members of the Shafter community stood near where a Shafter High School student was hit by a train to honor them as they recover from their injuries, and advocated for change along the railway.
• Shafter High School Principal Russell Shipley confirmed to 23ABC that it was a student who was hit by a train on Thursday, but said the school would not be releasing the name of the student out of respect for the family. Shipley added that the school was notified that the student made it through surgery and was in critical but stable condition.
• On Friday, 23ABC met Suzette Gama, a parent of a student in Shafter, who knew the teen who was hit. She said the situation was frustrating because, in her mind, without change, it could happen again.
• During the demonstration, Jesus Sanchez, a friend of the student, said he was in disbelief when he heard the news and fully expected to see the teen later that afternoon. Now, a day later, Sanchez said he hopes his friend has a speedy recovery and hopes the demonstration they put on starts the conversation surrounding change at the railroad crossing.

BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT:

Members of the Shafter Community and friends of the Shafter High Schooler who was hit by a train came together to not only rally around them, but advocate for change

The teen was hit by an Amtrak train Thursday afternoon at the rail crossing near Central Avenue and Central Valley Highway, also known as Highway 43.

Shafter High School Principal Russell Shipley confirmed a Shafter High School student was hit by a train, but said they do not plan to release the identity of the student out of respect for the family.

Less than 24 hours after the tragic news hit members in the Shafter community, residents were planning ways to honor the teen, while advocating for change along the railway.

Suzette Gama, a parent in shafter, said she knows the student who was hit, tand hat her children are friends with him.

""I feel mad, angry, sad, because I know him personally. My kids know him personally, they're really close to each other, and something needs to be done because it's going to continue happening if nothing is done.""

Near the spot where their friend was hit, several shafter high school students and shafter community members took to the street to advocate for their friend, donning signs advocating for a pedestrian bridge, the slowing of trains that run through Shafter and more, all while wearing necklaces and bracelets adorned with photos of their friend who was hit.

Jesus Sanchez, a freshman at Shafter High, says he’s known the teen since kindergarten, and the two were slated to meet up at the gym that evening. When Sanchez heard the news, he was in disbelief.

“They said someone got hit, but when I found out it was him, I was still in denial because he was supposed to meet me at the gym. So I was thinking, ‘Oh he’s going to walk through the doors of the gym any second,” but he just didn’t,” said Sanchez.

Sanchez adding he hopes the demonstration pushes change through Shafter.

“I hope to slow the train down and bring awareness to this situation that happened, and if possible, make a bridge so people feel safer when crossing.”

According to Shipley, the high school was told that the Student who was hit is in the intensive care unit, successfully had surgery, and is in critical but stable condition.

Reports said that a witness recounted seeing someone pick up a detached leg at the scene. Shockingly, a video captured the suspect carrying the limb on the roadside, even sniffing it before proceeding down the street. Eventually, surrounded by police cars, Tellez was apprehended near the Amtrak station for allegedly tampering with crime scene evidence.

US Authorities noted the pedestrian was struck near the train platform. Tellez faces charges for unlawfully removing human remains. His initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday. Details about the victim and Tellez’s motives remain undisclosed. This marks the second instance this year of someone absconding with body parts from a train accident site in US.

US Authorities noted the pedestrian was struck near the train platform. Tellez faces charges for unlawfully removing human remains. His initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday. Details about the victim and Tellez’s motives remain undisclosed. This marks the second instance this year of someone absconding with body parts from a train accident site in US.",Unknown,Unknown,"March 24, 2024"

A California man is competing with Florida Man for weirdest headline of the week -- 'cause he got arrested for walking around and apparently chomping on a human severed leg.

The dude's name is Rosendo Tellez. and he got busted Friday out near Bakersfield -- in a small town called Wasco -- after eyewitnesses saw him strolling through town with what looked to be an entire limb that was attached to a person just earlier in the day.

Kern County officials say the leg was illegally taken from the scene of a train accident that morning -- when Tellez is alleged to have swooped it up after a man was hit and killed at the Amtrak station in town. Not too long after that ... citizens say they spotted Tellez holding it.

Some even claimed to FOX26 News that Tellez was taking bites out of the leg ... which seemed to be the case based on this video of the guy that's circulating on the internet.

It's a gruesome sight ... as you can see the flesh dangling from the chopped-off leg, and sure enough -- you can also see this man, identified as Tellez, seemingly going in for a nibble.

Tellez was eventually intercepted by Sheriff's deputies ... and he was reportedly arrested without incident. He was booked on several charges -- including outstanding warrants, possession of drug paraphernalia and for removal of human remains from a location other than a cemetery. If you're curious ... that's considered a misdemeanor in California.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Amtrak station in Wasco,Unknown,Kern County,CA,06,Wasco,Unknown,K,Pedestrian,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,5,Amtrak station,Public,C,Unknown,1,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Freight Train,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,1,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,No,Unknown,Unknown,Yes,Yes,"A California man named Rosendo Tellez was arrested for walking around and biting a severed human leg.

Just before 7:30 a.m., Corcoran police officers were dispatched to the railroad crossing intersection of Orange and Otis avenues regarding a train colliding with a vehicle.

Officers arrived on scene and made contact with the driver of the vehicle, a 41-year-old man from Exeter, officials said.

The man was the sole occupant of the vehicle and officers said he complained of pain to his abdomen due to the impact from the collision. They said he was later transported to a local hospital for medical treatment. His condition was unavailable.

Based on the investigation, officers said they determined the man was traveling eastbound in his vehicle when it was struck in the rear passenger side by a Burlington Northern Santa Fe train traveling northbound at the intersection.

Police said the man’s vehicle, a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu, sustained major damage to the rear end and a railroad crossing arm was also damaged due to the collision.

Officials said the conductor of the train told officers that the man’s vehicle was seen entering the crossing while the railroad arms were down as the train was approaching. The conductor also said they sounded the train’s horn several times before it struck the vehicle, police said.

Authorities said no one on the train was injured and there was no damage to the train.

The Corcoran Police Department reminds motorists and pedestrians to follow these railroad crossing safety tips:
• Slow down when approaching a railroad crossing and look both ways twice.
• Never race a train to cross the tracks.
• Never pass another vehicle within 100 feet of a railroad crossing.
• Watch out for vehicles that must stop at railroad crossings, such as school buses or trucks carrying hazardous materials.
• When approaching a crossing, roll down your windows, turn off the radio or air conditioner and listen for whistles or bells.
• Always yield to flashing lights, whistles, closing gates or stop signs.
• If you must stop, keep a distance of at least 15 feet from the tracks.
• Teach children that the railroad is never a place to play, walk, run, bike ride or use as a short cut.
• Always cross the tracks at the designated railroad crossing or pedestrian crossing.
• Only use the crossing if you can be sure your vehicle is high enough to completely clear the railroad crossing without stopping.
• Don’t be fooled, a train is always moving faster and is much closer than you think.",Burlington Northern Santa Fe,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,CA,06,Corcoran,Orange and Otis avenues,A,2005 Chevrolet Malibu,Unknown,3,3,Unknown,1,Burlington Northern Santa Fe train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Day,Unknown,Unknown,1,Burlington Northern Santa Fe,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,4,Northbound,1,Gates,Unknown,A,Dry,1,Both sides,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,41,1,Male,2,Unknown,2,Unknown,3,Unknown,7,Unknown,1,41-year-old man from Exeter,0,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,0,No,No,"Just before 7:30 a.m., Corcoran police officers were dispatched to the railroad crossing intersection of Orange and Otis avenues regarding a train colliding with a vehicle.

Gallagher, who was discovered dead outside of her vehicle, would have turned 30 March 6.
A former middle school teacher in the Roosevelt School District, according to the Post, Gallagher was on her way home from her second job at a restaurant when the high winds caused her car to veer off the road, the New York Daily News reported.

A man who was struck by a train and killed in Sydney's south overnight was believed to have been running across the railway tracks after vandalising another stationary train, police say.
The 25-year-old man was hit by the passenger train near Kingsgrove Railway Station just after midnight.
Police and paramedics arrived at the station a short time later but could not revive the man, who died at the scene.
A NSW Police spokesman said an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the man's death was ongoing.
Initial inquiries, however, suggested the man may have just vandalised another stationary train before he ran across the train tracks and was struck.
It is believed he did not see the south-bound passenger train that hit him. That train was carrying scores of passengers from the city towards Macarthur at the time.
All south-bound trains between Turrella and Macarthur on the T2 Airport Line were suspended while officers from the St George Local Area Command established a crime scene, which was examined by forensic officers overnight.

They were the first on the scene when they rushed to help rescue passengers.

Raymie Howard, 23, Andy Saiz, 31, and Leslie Saiz, 39, were in the back yard area of their home — empty fields bordering Kansas Avenue and 10th Avenue, just south of Hanford — when a semi truck with two trailers hauling cotton trash hit the last car of an Amtrak train heading to Bakersfield.

“I was just standing in the back yard while one of the other guys was on the quad when BOOM,” Howard said. “It looked like the whole back train was on fire.”

But what looked like smoke turned out to be black, thick dust.

The crash injured about 40 of the train’s 170 passengers, but none seriously. Even the driver of the truck suffered only minor injuries.

“I ran over there. It was incredible,” Howard said. “That truck was going west but after hitting the back end of the train, it flipped 180 degrees and ended up facing the opposite way.”

Howard and the Saiz brothers were the first on the scene at the railroad crossing on Kansas Avenue. The glanced at the train, they said, and saw it “wobbling” down the tracks.

“Everything was gone. His engine was gone. The cab of the truck was gone. All that was left was one small bubble where the driver sat,” Howard said. “The dude was just sitting there, not making any noise. He wasn’t responding — he was unconscious.”

A few seconds later, the man began to moan.

“I didn’t want to touch him. Just then a probation officer pulled up and said the train had just derailed,” Howard said. “He was checking the truck driver and hehad merun up thetracks looking to see if any passengers had been thrown out of the train. We nev­er saw anyone along the way.”

But as they approached thederailed train,thesight was frightening.

“People were coming out with broken arms and broken legs — you could tell just by looking at them andthewaytheyheldtheir [limbs.] There was a lot of crying. Even people who were not hurt were all crying,” Howardsaid.“Everyone was freaking out.”

Howard said he saw a lady with a crying month-old baby covered in what appeared to be black soot and dirt.

“It scared me. I took off my shirt and gave it to the lady to clean the baby’s face up,” Howard said. “The baby was not even hers. She had picked it up and was looking for the mother.”

Andy Saiz said he was on the quad, heard the hit, andlookeduptoseeahuge cloud of dust.

“It was so thick, I could not see in front of me. It was bad,” Andy Saiz said. “I was shocked. There was no motor left to the truck. It was gone. The drivers’ feet were hanging off the bottom of the cab that was now gone. I kept shouting ‘Can you hear me?’ but got no response.”

Saiz rushed to the train and saw a lady with a broken arm, he said.

“The [passengers] were coming out of the doors and getting pulled out of windows,” Andy Saiz said. “There were a lot of old ladies and old men covered in black dirt.”

LeslieSaiz said hetalked to one of the men.

“His face was all bloody and he had dirt and glass all over his face so I ran to help him,” Leslie Saiz said. “He said he was sitting looking out the window as thetrain was crossing [Kansas Avenue.] He saw the truck and the way he told it, the truck only slowed. It did not stop completely.”

Leslie Saiz said the passenger told him hethought the driver miscalculated the train’s passing.

“It seemed like he slowed to let the train pass but then either he sped up or the train slowed, and the truck hit the last train car,” Leslie Saiz said. “At least that’s what it sounded like.”

The collision occurred a few minutes after noon on Monday — with the first 9-1-1 call received at 12:22 p.m., said Jerry Pierce, California Highway Patrol Public Affairs Officer, Hanford office.

“Two minutes later we got an updatethat thetrain wasinfactanAmtraktrain and that some of the cars had partially overturned,” Pierce said.

Thecollision was reported as occurring on Kansas Avenue at the rail road crossing, between 10th and 10 and a half.

“The train came to rest about two football fields past the point of impact,” Pierce said.

The driver was pulling two trailers of ‘cotton trash’ and had minor to moderate injuries.

As Pierce checked on the driver, emergency personnel had been on the scene for an approximate 30 minutes.

“The majority of the passengers were checked and treated just outside the train,” Pierce said.

Brett Blanchard, who was identified as the engineer of the Amtrak passenger train that collided with the semitrailer, did not appear to be injured.

Pierce placed an initial report of an approximate 150 to 200 passengers on the train, which had just leftHanfordandwasheading to Bakersfield.

“The initial report of the injured is between 30 and 50,” Pierce said. “Most of the injuries are minor. I have not heard of any major or severe injuries. No one was transported by lifeline — indicating serious injuries — away from the scene.”

Pierce also praised the prompt help from numerous entities, including Kings County Sheriff, Hanford Police Department,Kings County Probation, Kings County District Attorney’s Office, Kings County Fire Department and fire volunteers, Hanford Fire Department and volunteers, and other fire personnel.

Numerous ambulances responded to the site and a triage area sorted passengers based on their need for immediate medical treatment.

The injured were transported to hospitals in Hanford, Tulare and Visalia.

TulareRegional Medical Center reported receiving 10 patients for medical evaluation, and Kaweah Delta District Hospital, Visalia, reported having received nine patients with moderate injuries and four more on enroute at 3:39 p.m.

The majority of the passengers were transported by Hanford Joint Union High School District buses to the Hanford Civic Auditorium.

“From there, those that choose to, will be transported by Amtrak to a connection in Bakersfield,” Pierce said. “I was told the [rail] line will be down a minimum of four hours, and that was at 2 p.m., so we’re looking ‘till 6 p.m. at least.”

Members of the public who think they may have a family member involved in the incident sould call Amtrak at 1-800-523-9010.

The train struck the unidentified person around 11:10 a.m. near the 7000 block of North Tujunga Avenue, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.
There was no immediate description of the pedestrian or what led to the person being struck. Fire officials said 33 passengers were on the train, but no additional injuries were reported.
The Metrolink tracks between Burbank and Van Nuys were shut down while an investigation was conducted, leading to some trip cancellations by the regional rail service.
In 2024, at least four people were killed in accidents involving Metrolink trains along the segment of tracks between Burbank and Glendale. And in February, a man was killed in Boyle Heights after he was struck by a Metrolink train.
Vehicles have also been involved in collisions on Burbank tracks in recent years.
According to data published by the Federal Railroad Administration, California leads the nation in railroad fatalities, with 185 deaths in 2024, though that number fell from 251 in 2023.
“Metrolink continually works to communicate to the community, riders and the general public that people need to be aware anytime they’re around the tracks or at intersections,” according to Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson. “Obviously, trespassing is a crime, but we are concerned with the bigger picture issues that result in injury and loss of life.”
Homeless encampments near train tracks are related to increased cases of death or injury, said Johnson. In fact, he noted, in areas where law enforcement has identified higher rates of homelessness, the rates of pedestrian-train injuries and fatalities are higher.
“We recognize that homeless encampments, or people living near or using rights of way as a thoroughfare, or actually as a place to live, can lead to dangerous situations involving trains,” Johnson said.
Metrolink has invested significant resources into suicide prevention, rail safety education and awareness, and technology, he said. Recently, Metrolink received funding for a track intrusion detection system.
“This is one example of Metrolink trying to proactively use technologies to keep people off of the right of way. And if, for some reason, they still find their way onto the tracks or along the right of way, this system would allow the engineers of the trains advance notice to either slow or stop their trains,” Johnson said.
The pedestrian fatality on Wednesday is still being investigated, and a cause of death will likely be determined by the L.A. County coroner’s office in the next 60 days.

The Metrolink Ventura County Line took to social media to announce the crash at about 2:15 p.m.

The Ventura County Fire Department later detailed that the southbound Ventura County Line 118 train hit the vehicle at Las Posas Road and Fifth Street between Camarillo and Oxnard.

OXNARD, CALIFORNIA (March 26, 2025) – A woman operating a taco stand was critically injured after she was hit by debris when a Metrolink train collided with a big rig truck in Oxnard.
Los Angeles County officials are saying that the incident took place around 7:15 PM on Tuesday. A big rig was stopped on the tracks along Rice Avenue.
A Metrolink train collided with the back portion of the trailer, which caused debris to be launched in numerous directions. Some of that debris hit a nearby food vendor.
Paramedics were called to the scene in order to help the victim. She sustained critical injuries to her head and was transported to the hospital. Two people on the train also reported experiencing neck pain.
There is a history of collisions at the same intersection. In 2015, a Metrolink train derailed after hitting a truck that was on the tracks. An engineer died, and an estimated 28 people were injured.
It remains unclear why the big rig was stopped on the train tracks. A full investigation into the Oxnard train accident remains ongoing.
Liability for Los Angeles County Train Accidents
Train accidents are much more common than many people may realize. According to the National Safety Council, “Railroad deaths totaled 995 in 2023, a 10% increase from the 2022 revised total of 908 and the highest since 2007. Nonfatal injuries totaled 6,705, a 3% increase from the 2022 revised total of 6,513.” Many railroad collisions involve commercial trucks. Truck drivers should take a number of measures in order to avoid being hit by trains.
- Truck drivers should pay attention to warning signs and flashing lights at crossing gates.
- Truck drivers should approach train tracks cautiously, especially at night when visibility is reduced.
- Truck drivers should never stop on train tracks for any reason.
- Truck drivers should use extra caution when crossing at uncontrolled crossings.
Depending on the facts of any case, there could be numerous liable parties for any collision between a big rig truck and a train. A truck driver could be liable if their vehicle is hit by a Metrolink train. There are many laws that govern how truck drivers may cross railroad tracks. Pursuant to Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations § 392.12, “No driver of a commercial motor vehicle shall drive onto a highway-rail grade crossing without having sufficient space to drive completely through the crossing without stopping.” If a truck driver stopped on a set of train tracks prior to being hit by a train, this could form the basis of a negligence claim.
Metrolink or other train companies may also be liable for a train accident. Train operators have a legal obligation to exercise due care in order to avoid collisions. This includes operating a train at a safe speed at all times. They must also slow down to avoid hazards along the tracks. Pursuant to Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations § 222, train operators are required to use their horn at least 15 to 20 seconds before reaching a public highway-rail grade crossing. If a train operator fails to take reasonable measures to avoid colliding with a truck, they could be held liable for a collision.
A municipal entity like a city could be legally responsible for a train accident if it was caused in part by a dangerous condition on public property. Pursuant to California Government Code 835, a public entity could be liable for a dangerous condition on its property if (1) the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the incident, (2) the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, and (3) the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury that occurred. There are numerous ways that a highway-rail grade crossing could be in a dangerous condition.
- A crossing may have a short storage area between the tracks and an adjacent intersection that creates an entrapment hazard for vehicles.
- A crossing may lack clear guidance for drivers that results in them remaining positioned on the tracks.
- A crossing may have non-functioning or delayed warning signals that failed to properly alert drivers of an incoming train.
It can be hard to know what to do if you’ve been injured in a train accident. Victims of these collisions are often left with high medical bills and may need to take extensive periods of time away from work. In the event of a severe injury, accident victims could also be left with lifelong disabilities that impact their capacity to live a normal life. It is important that victims understand that they do have legal rights if they are injured in a Los Angeles County train accident. They may be able to seek some measure of accountability through a personal injury claim.

The incident occurred when the victim was searching for his father at the Chheoki railway station after Mahashivratri. Unfortunately, he came under the train, resulting in the amputation of his left arm and left leg.
The severely injured youth, who was found in an abandoned state, was immediately attended to by the govt railway police (GRP) and rushed to SRN Hospital's trauma centre.
There, a dedicated team of doctors, led by associate professor Dr. Santosh Kumar Singh and including Dr. Zia ur Rahman, Dr. Aman Gupta, Dr. Sohail, Dr. Adarsh, and Dr. Chandrash Pandey, worked tirelessly to stabilise him and perform complex surgeries to save his life. Apart from the surgical team's expertise, SRN Hospital's administration and superintendent-in-chief Dr. Ajai Saxena ensured timely arrangements of blood, medicines, and other essential resources during and after the surgery. Their efforts played a crucial role in the patient's survival and recovery.
Remarkably, alongside medical recovery, the doctors and hospital staff also took steps to reunite the patient with his family. After the surgery, he was identified as Deep (26), a resident of Banda district, who was desperately searching for his father, Yogesh (55), when the tragic accident happened. His sister, Pinky, expressed gratitude saying, ""We lost all hope, but the doctors at SRN Hospital gave my brother a new life. We will forever be indebted to them.""
Speaking about the surgery, Dr. Santosh Kumar Singh said, ""The case was extremely critical as the patient suffered massive blood loss. Immediate surgical intervention was the only way to save his life. Our team worked relentlessly to stabilise and treat him. The support from the hospital administration and blood bank was instrumental in ensuring a smooth surgery and postoperative care.""

A pedestrian died Monday morning after they were hit by a freight train traveling through South Los Angeles.

The collision happened around 7:20 a.m. near the intersection of Florence Avenue and Graham Avenue in the Florence-Firestone neighborhood.

The pedestrian was hit by a Union Pacific freight train and was declared dead at the scene.

Union Pacific, the second-largest railroad operator in the U.S. and one of the most prominent in the world, confirmed to KTLA that a pedestrian was struck and killed by one of its trains, adding that the crew onboard was uninjured.

A spokesperson said the company was working with local authorities to “understand what led up to the incident.”

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the L.A. County Fire Department were among the agencies to responded to the scene.

Trespassing on train tracks is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in the United States, according to the Transportation Department. It is a misdemeanor in California that can result in jail time or hundreds of dollars in penalties.

Where on the tracks the collision happened is unclear, but the nearby intersection is at-grade, meaning at street level, and is protected only by crossing gates and lights.

The DOT urges pedestrians to “always expect a train” when near tracks, as they don’t always follow a set schedule, don’t always sound warning horns when approaching a crossing and can take upwards of a mile to come to a complete stop.

“Even when you are not standing directly on the tracks, you risk being hit by a train by being on railroad property,” the DOT says.

Sept. 14 (UPI) -- At least three died, including two children, and at least 40 were injured when two passenger trains collided in the Nile Delta area in northeastern Egypt on Saturday.

The collision occurred in the city of Zagazig in Egypt's Al Sharkia province and crumpled one passenger car, Egypt Today reported.

First responders assisted injured passengers through the windows of damaged train cars.

Rescue operations are ongoing with those injured being taken to nearby Al-Ahrar and Zagazig hospitals, Egypt's Ministry of Health reported.

One train was destined for Ismailia from Zigazag while the other was destined for Zigazag from Mansoura.

Thirty ambulances and several medical teams responded to the accident scene while crowds of people gathered.

Egypt's rail system is in a state of decay and has recorded at least one deadly accident every year over the past 20 years.

Egypt reported 2,044 train accidents in 2018 and 1,793 in 2019, Egypt's Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics reported.

A train collision in 2021 killed at least 32 and injured 165. Another 25 people died while dozens were injured during a 2019 accident in which a train collided with a platform that caused a fuel tank to explode.

Of the roughly 200 passengers, 15 were injured. MICHAEL COONS/Acorn Newspapers
A woman injured in the derailment of an Amtrak train that slammed into a county water truck in Moorpark has add­ed the County of Ventura in a federal law­suit seeking damages over negligence.
In a 15-page filing in the U.S. Dis­trict Court in Los Angeles, Augustina
Duran claims the county is at fault for failing to properly train and su­pervise Angel Gurrola—described on his LinkedIn page as a “maintenance worker at County of Ventura”—who, on June 28, 2023, reportedly was operating a General Services Agency truck that somehow got stuck on the tracks before the 11:15 a.m. collision.
“Prior to the collision, Gurrola negligently operated the vehicle and caused the vehicle to be present on the tracks at the time the Amtrak train came through,” plaintiff’s attorney William Percy asserts.
Specifically, Duran’s attorney claims Gurrola “failed to act as a rea­sonable driver by traveling over the train track without checking that the course was clear, that there was ade­quate time to safely cross, and traveling speeds which rendered his ability to take precautionary measures to avoid collision with the train.”
As a result, his client suffered sub­stantial cervical spine, lumbar spine and right knee injuries.
“Plaintiff also suffered from loss of enjoyment of life, pain and suffering, and wage loss.”
For her suffering, the plaintiff is seeking no less than $23,324.50 in special damages, plus other damages as determined by a jury.
The truck was part of a dust-control effort at a debris basin near Los Angeles Avenue and Gabbert Road.
Several train cars jumped the tracks, but all remained upright. There were about 200 people on board.
As for Amtrak, Duran’s amended complaint alleges that Amtrak “so wantonly, recklessly and negligently operated, controlled, entrusted and maintained the train so as to cause the train to collide” with the GSA vehicle.
The complaint further alleges that the train engineer and other crew were negligent “by failing to comply with safety regulations, failing to sound suf­ficient audible warning devices, failing to regulate said train under safe speed and/or failing to keep lookout for the vehicle stopped in the tracks, failing to slow or stop the train and failing to control the train so as to avoid hitting the vehicle.”
Among other things, the crew is accused of using a horn that “did not provide sufficient audible warning of the train’s approach prior to the inci­dent.”",Amtrak,County of Ventura,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,6,28,2023,11,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Ventura,CA,06,Moorpark,Los Angeles Avenue and Gabbert Road,B,County of Ventura water truck,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Amtrak Coast Starlight train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Passenger Train-Pulling,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,6,Audible,Unknown,A,Dry,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,2,Female,2,No,4,Stopped on crossing,2,No,6,Highway vehicles,2,No,0,15,185,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,200,Yes,Unknown,200,Unknown,Unknown,"An Amtrak Coast Starlight train headed to Seattle derailed after hitting a County of Ventura water truck in Moorpark on June 28.

She was being consoled by her friend Luis Hernandez, who said the man who was killed was her boyfriend. Local resident Naomi Stenson stopped on Soledad Canyon Road, held her hands toward the group of grieving friends and family and said a prayer for them Wednesday morning before continuing on her morning commute near the bike path on the major street. Throughout the morning, the Metrolink Antelope Valley Line account on X, formerly known as Twitter, provided updates for passengers who take the commuter train from stations in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys. As of 10 a.m., the tracks remained closed and Train No. 212 was being held at the Via Princessa Station. The tracks reopened shortly after 11:30 a.m. and commuter train service resumed, with speed restrictions in the area near the collision scene. The @MetrolinkAV account advised passengers to visit metrolinktrains.com/ubervouchers and metrolinktrains.com/qsp for information on how to receive reimbursement or Uber vouchers for alternate transportation. The coroner’s office had not yet released the identity of the person killed as of Wednesday afternoon, pending the notification of his next-of-kin.  This is a breaking news story and more information will be added as it becomes available. Reporting from the scene by Senior Staff Writer Perry Smith. A woman grieves over the death of a man who was killed when he was struck by a Metrolink train on Wednesday morning.

Perry Smith/The SignalAt the site of the collision, as detectives investigated the incident, a scene of grief played out just as it had last week at the same intersection, when an extremely distraught woman at the scene identified herself as the mother of the 21-year-old man killed when he was struck by a train in the evening on Labor Day. On Wednesday morning, a woman sat crying on the sidewalk near the scene of the collision. She was being consoled by her friend Luis Hernandez, who said the man who was killed was her boyfriend. Local resident Naomi Stenson stopped on Soledad Canyon Road, held her hands toward the group of grieving friends and family and said a prayer for them Wednesday morning before continuing on her morning commute near the bike path on the major street. Throughout the morning, the Metrolink Antelope Valley Line account on X, formerly known as Twitter, provided updates for passengers who take the commuter train from stations in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys. As of 10 a.m., the tracks remained closed and Train No. 212 was being held at the Via Princessa Station. The tracks reopened shortly after 11:30 a.m. and commuter train service resumed, with speed restrictions in the area near the collision scene. The @MetrolinkAV account advised passengers to visit metrolinktrains.com/ub",,,

A serious accident is snarling the morning commute for many across our area.
A freight train crashed into a large truck around 6:30 a.m. in Yardley, Pa., according to 94.5 PST's Total Traffic. It was right near the railroad crossing at Big Oak and Township Line Road, they say.
Here's footage of the accident from Philadelphia's NBC 10:
SEPTA's West Trenton Line uses those same tracks, and as a result, service has been adjusted. Service had been stopped in both directions on the train line, but that has improved (as of 8:00 a.m.).
""Inbound train service has resumed between West Trenton and Neshaminy Falls Stations with delays of up to 30 minutes,"" SEPTA wrote. ""Inbound train #6307 will be the first train to operate to Center City. Outbound train #5300 will terminate service at Neshaminy Station.""
There were no reports of injuries, as of 8 am Thursday.

SAN DIEGO — There were three serious train accidents in San Diego County over the Labor Day holiday weekend. Two were deadly. One of those deadly accidents occurred Sunday afternoon at the Washington Street train station.

Tom Sayer says he’s been working near this train stop for 25 years.

""There's always danger. There's going to be danger no matter what. I don't know how you make it safer."" Tom says, bicyclists and pedestrians must be cautious. ""Trains slow down and they go really slow through here. That's been the case for a long time. I think everyone has got to be careful.""



It's not just Washington Street. There was another deadly train accident on Monday where a woman was hit by another coaster train near Morena Boulevard and Asher Street in San Diego.

In Del Mar, a pedestrian was seriously hurt when they were also hit by a coaster train near Via De La Valle and Camino Del Mar.

All of the accidents happened within a 36-hour window.



Tom says the crossings where he works seem safe enough.

""It seems like the people that are unsafe here are unsafe because they're not taking care of their own safety."" Tom adds, ""all those measures and the red lights are flashing? It's pretty clear that the train is coming if you're paying attention.""

Robin says, she was neighbors with the victim who died Sunday afternoon.

""I just know he rode his bike all the time. He's missed,” Robin offered. ""I saw him 'Good morning' every morning. He was an older gentleman, kind of stayed to himself.""



Robin says, train safety is important to remember. ""I think it's safe because they're loud enough. I can hear them coming. If he didn't honk his horn, maybe. I'd never have headphones on in this area. That would be dangerous. But you can feel the train coming because the tracks vibrate. So if you didn't hear it, you could still feel the vibration of the train.""

Luke says he's a bicyclist and there are things pedestrians and bike riders have to remember at train stops. ""You can hear the sirens, you can hear the gates coming up and down and you can hear the train from quite a distance. You do have to take personal responsibility for knowing where you are and foreign objects like trains, traffic and things like that so there is some personal responsibility that has to happen, I think.""

We reached out to the North County Transit District for comment on this story and they sent us the following statement:

“Unfortunately, over the Labor Day weekend the COASTER experienced three separate incidents of individuals who were trespassing in NCTD’s right of way being struck by a train. These are tragic events that not only impact families and communities, but also the mental health of railroad employees, passengers, first responders, and others.

The importance of being aware of your surroundings when you are near the rail line cannot be overstated. Trains are bigger, faster, and quieter than you think. We urge the public to stay clear of the rail line, cross only at designated areas, and always expect a train to come when you see the tracks.”

What to do when at a railroad crossing

One train accident is an accident too many. Here are some quick tips to remember when you're at a railroad crossing:

Use common sense

Look both ways.

Listen for the train.

Make sure there’s room for you and or your vehicle on the other side of the crossing.

And pay attention to all of the signs, markers and don't underestimate those flashing lights, or the train's speed. Here are additional tips from the Federal Railroad Administration.

Background information

NCTD is actively participating in a nationwide effort in September to remind the public of the importance of rail safety. Link: Press Release.

Maseeh Muhammad was identified by the L.A. County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office to have been fatally struck near the intersection of Golden Triangle Road and Ruether Avenue.

Muhammad, a Santa Clarita resident, was 21 years old at the time of his death, 25 days away from his 22nd birthday.

The collision occurred at approximately 6:30 p.m. Passengers and crew of the train were either interviewed by sheriff’s deputies or escorted off the train — which was approximately 700 feet from where the collision took place.

Lt. Richard O’Neil, watch commander for the SCV Sheriff’s Station, said the collision does not appear to be a suicide, but rather appears to be an accident.

Oscar Sol/For The Signal

At the scene of the incident on Monday night, a woman and man waited while deputies investigated. The woman, extremely distraught, believed the victim was her son who had been out walking a dog. The victim’s identity had yet to be officially confirmed at the time.

Metrolink lines were delayed on the Antelope Valley line well into the evening.

The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station is investigating the incident, at the time of this publication.

Train collisions are, unfortunately, not uncommon in California. A pedestrian was fatally hit by a Union Pacific Railroad train at Roseville Road and Myrtle Avenue in February, The Bee reported. In March, a Sacramento light rail hit a pickup truck in Rancho Cordova. The truck driver suffered minor to moderate injuries.In June, a Union Pacific train struck and killed a pedestrian in south Sacramento, and a month later, a man was struck by an Amtrak passenger train in Yolo County.Most recently, a pedestrian was fatally hit by a freight train in midtown Sacramento, near 20th and Q streets, Monday afternoon.How common are train crashes in California?More than 2,000 train collisions occurred throughout the country in 2022, according to preliminary data from the Federal Railroad Administration.California had the second highest rate of accidents, with 172 total highway-rail grade crossing collisions, 42 deaths and 38 injuries, statistics showed. Texas ranked No. 1 for the most accidents in the U.S. with 241 total collisions, 31 deaths and 80 injuries.Every 3 hours in the country, a person or vehicle is hit by a train, Operation Lifesaver, a national non-profit that leads rail safety education, stated on its website.The organization advises pedestrians to always expect a train, adding that walking on or beside the tracks is illegal.  You should never pass when the lights are flashing, don’t go around the gates and wait to cross once you can see clearly in both directions, it recommended.Trains also have the right of way over cars, pedestrians and emergency vehicles.How police respondSacramento Police Officer Anthony Gamble told The Bee that when a train collision happens, the police department’s role is to respond, provide medical assistance and stabilize the scene. Investigations into the accident are conducted by the respective train agency, Gamble said. In Monday’s fatal collision, police blocked off several surrounding streets. If roads need to be blocked off after the accident, Gamble said the length of time will vary depending on the train company. What do you want to know about life in Sacramento?

Jahaad Atkinson, 9, was the type of kid who would dress up in a Spiderman costume to get a laugh out of his siblings. He loved to play the online game Roblox and the color red.

Ahyir Womack, 12, had an infectious smile whenever he saw loved ones and he loved a good bit — such as that time he wore a relative’s sneakers that were comically large for him.

“He couldn’t dance to save his life,” said his sister Aihyana Womack, 13, showing a video in which her brother was doing some Carlton Banks-like moves to laughs in the background.

Both boys were killed in Chester on April 29 when southbound Amtrak Train 161 struck them as it made its way through Delaware County on its way to Washington. Few details about the accident have been made public; Amtrak initially said the children were “trespassing” but has not released additional information. With few answers, the city has wrapped itself around the boys’ families, sharing condolences and calling for more resources directed at young people.

“Our school is working on different activities with students outside the regular school hours,” said David Clark Jr., CEO of Chester Community Charter School, where Jahaad was enrolled and Ahyir was a former student. “We recognized that we had to step it up and we are.”

The school said it will help pay for both of the boys’ funerals.

Still, all Johnesha Gordon, 32, can do is bury herself in the memory of her nephew Jahaad, who she said people called Tink, Haad, or Haadi.

“A lot of people gravitated toward Jahaad, even at 9,” said Gordon. “When he came around, you had a smile on your face.”

He marched to the beat of his own drum. For example, Jahaad liked the Los Angeles Chargers football team, which adults joke couldn’t have been easy in Eagles country.

Gordon said Jahaad was the second oldest of four children. Jahaad’s stepbrother Rashad Anderson, 13, said he was often getting calls to come outside and play basketball or an invite to play Fortnite.

Aside from being family-oriented, social butterflies, Jahaad and Ahyir shared a love of bikes.

Ahyir’s friends and relatives say he liked to ride around for hours on end. When he wasn’t on his bike, he loved to play-fight with his friends and family.

“He swore he could beat me,” his uncle Drequon Harmon said with a laugh, recalling how Ahyir would come over to his house and hang out.

Harmon said his nephew “loved life” and was unabashedly himself.

“He was always so hype,” echoed Ahyir’s sister Aihyana. “His smile was everything.”

More than 100 family members, friends, and strangers attended a candlelight vigil at MLK Park on Friday night with the view of the train tracks where the children died within eyesight. Many wore T-shirts that showed the children laughing and making goofy faces. One Chester Community Charter School student carried flowers for her former classmate.

To the muffled sobs, attendees released balloons in honor of the boys. Red balloons peppered the sky.

SOUTH LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Two people were injured and an SUV was split in half following a horrific crash involving a Metro Blue Line train in South Los Angeles Thursday afternoon, according to authorities.

L.A. Fire Department officials say the crash was reported just before 3:45 p.m. in the 1600 block of E. Vernon Avenue, near Vernon Station.

Footage from the scene showed the vehicle severely damaged and squeezed between the train and a small fence.

Preliminary information indicates the driver made a left turn in front of the train, resulting in the collision. Firefighters extricated a woman from the vehicle and transported her to a hospital in unknown condition.

Dozens of passengers were on board the train at the time of the crash, but none were apparently hurt. A pedestrian, who was not hit by the train, suffered a minor injury and was also transported to a hospital.

Shuttle buses transported passengers between Slauson and Washington stations due to the crash, according to Metro.

It's unknown when the portion of the train route impacted by the crash will reopen.

(KCTV) - BNSF Railway filed a lawsuit this week against victims and surviving family members of the summer’s deadly Amtrak train derailment in Mendon, MO, saying Terms And Conditions of buying the ticket included language barring them from suing the railroad.

Victims and surviving family members of the June 27 crash that killed four people and injured 150 others have been suing BNSF over the incident in recent months, since the railway owns and operates the tracks that particular Amtrak train used to travel the trip between Los Angeles and Chicago. National Transportation Safety Board investigators had determined that the crossing where the crash occurred did not have safety mechanisms in place---including crossing arms, bells or lights. The train derailed after colliding with a dump truck at the crossing.

The lawsuits filed by the victims and surviving family members claim BNSF had been previously warned about safety issues on such crossings.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court Tuesday in Missouri, BNSF claims victims and their families cannot seek financial compensation through the courts, because passengers on the train all had to check boxes on lengthy Terms And Conditions in order to buy a ticket. Those check-boxes included language stating that any disputes passengers may have with the railroad must be arbitrated directly with the company and not through the court system, the lawsuit claims.

The crash site is less than two hours northeast of the Kansas City area, and a Kansas City attorney---Sean Hamer of Scharnhorst Ast Kennard Griffin PC law firm---is representing BNSF in the lawsuit. Another Kansas City attorney---Grant Davis of Davis, Bethune & Jones---is representing dozens of plaintiffs who are suing the railroad. Many of the passengers in the crash were from the Kansas City area, and three of the people who died were local---Rochelle Cook, 58, of De Soto, KS, Kim Holsapple, 56, of De Soto, and Binh Pham, 82, of Kansas City, MO.

There is no next court date listed yet for the case.

This is a developing situation, and KCTV5 will be updating this story.

MILAN, N.M. – A woman was struck by a train in the Village of Milan, New Mexico. The incident occurred on August 2 in between Route 66 and Elkins Road in the village. The woman did not survive the accident. Milan Police Department reminds residents that train tracks, and their subsequent right-of-ways are private property, it is both illegal and dangerous to be on the tracks.

The train was travelling eastbound, from Los Angeles, California, to Chicago, Illinois when it began passing through the Village of Milan. A woman, who will not be named, was attempting to cross the railroad tracks after leaving the Dollar General store on Route 66.

Because of the devastation from the crash, it took the police longer than normal to identify the woman. They determined that the female victim was attempting to cross the road and make her way to Berryhill in Milan where a friend lived.

Milan Police Department believes that she tried to beat the train, but it’s possible that she didn’t realize it was coming. MPD Sergeant Joe Galindo said, “[People who walk the tracks] may not hear the train approaching, or they think it might be further away. When you’re on those tracks, by the time you realize something is coming, it comes quick. I’ve worked plenty of incidents where we’re on the train tracks and ‘Oh, there is a train coming,’ they come a lot faster than they look.”

Village police remind residents that train tracks are private property. It is both illegal, and dangerous to walk the railroad tracks. “I don’t know if the people actually know this,” Sgt. Galindo said, “The right-of-way roads, the access roads on the side of the train tracks – and the train tracks themselves – are considered private property. So, it is trespassing to even be there. No one is supposed to be on that road.”

The US Standard for railroad tracks is four feet and eight-and-a-half inches. This is the standard for the width between two rails. According to Amtrack’s National Fact Sheet, trains regularly reach speeds of 125 to 140 miles per hour.

The westbound Empire Builder train derailed about 4 p.m. near Joplin, a town of about 200, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said in a statement. The accident scene is about 150 miles (241 kilometers) northeast of Helena and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border with Canada.

Liberty County sheriff's dispatcher Starr Tyler told The Associated Press that three people died in the derailment. She did not have more details. Amtrak confirmed the deaths and said there were multiple injuries.

""We are deeply saddened to learn local authorities are now confirming that three people have lost their lives as a result of this accident,"" Abrams said.

The train had about 141 passengers and 16 crew members onboard, Abrams said. The train had two locomotives and 10 cars, eight of which derailed, he said.

""We are deeply saddened to learn local authorities are now confirming that three people have lost their lives as a result of this accident,"" Abrams said.

Megan Vandervest, a passenger who was going to visit a friend in Seattle, told The New York Times that she was awakened by the derailment.

""My first thought was that we were derailing because, to be honest, I have anxiety and I had heard stories about trains derailing,"" said Vandervest, who is from Minneapolis. ""My second thought was that's crazy. We wouldn't be derailing. Like, that doesn't happen.""

She told the Times that the car behind hers was tilted, the one behind that was tipped over, and the three cars behind that ""had completely fallen off the tracks and were detached from the train.""

Speaking from the Liberty County Senior Center, where some passengers were being taken, Vandervest said it felt like ""extreme turbulence on a plane.""

Residents of communities near the crash site quickly mobilized to help the passengers.

Chester Councilwoman Rachel Ghekiere said she and others helped about 50 to 60 passengers who were brought to a local school.

""I went to the school and assisted with water, food, wiping dirt off faces,"" she said. ""They appeared to be tired, shaken but happy that they were where they were. Some looked more disheveled than others, depending where they were on the train.""

A grocery store in Chester, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the derailment, and a nearby religious community provided food, she said.

The passengers were taken by buses to hotels in nearby Shelby, said Ghekiere, whose husband works for the local emergency services agency and was alerted to the crash.

The National Transportation Safety Board will send a 14-member team, including investigators and specialists in railroad signals and other disciplines, to investigate the crash, spokesman Eric Weiss said.

Weiss said the derailment occurred around 3:55 p.m. and no other trains or equipment were involved. The train was traveling on a BNSF Railway main track at the time, he said.

Photos posted to social media showed rail cars on their sides and passengers standing alongside the tracks, some carrying luggage. The images showed sunny skies, and it appeared the accident occurred along a straight section of tracks.

Amtrak said that because of the derailment, the Sunday westbound Empire Builder will terminate in Minneapolis, and the Sunday eastbound Empire Builder train will originate in Minneapolis.

Allan Zarembski, director of the University of Delaware's Railway Engineering and Safety Program, said he didn't want to speculate but suspected the derailment stemmed from an issue with the train track or equipment, or a combination of both.

Railways have ""virtually eliminated"" major derailments by human error after the implementation of positive train control nationwide, Zarembski said.

""I would be surprised if this was a human-factor derailment,"" Zarembski said.

Depending on how complex the cause of the derailment was, NTSB findings may take months, he added, as investigators must interview witnesses and sift through the pile-up and damage to collect evidence and then send samples off for further testing.

Officers received the call at 12:40 p.m., according to Sgt. Miguel Valenzuela, and found the 2000 Lexus LS300 wedged between the southbound train and the barrier separating the tracks from the street.

“Once officers arrived at the scene, we escorted everyone off the train,” Valenzuela said.

A 60-year-old female passenger who was on the train heading to Downtown Long Beach when the accident occurred said she and fellow passengers felt a “jolt” when the train collided with the car on the corner of Long Beach Boulevard and 14th Street. Shortly after, the woman—who declined to give her name—said the conductor came to check on her and fellow passengers, but no injuries were reported at the time.

Around 12:50 p.m., passengers could be seen filing out of the train cars toward nearby bus stations.

The driver and passenger of the silver Lexus also reported no injuries. The driver, 53-year-old Rebecca Howard, was visibly shaken by the crash. The Harbor City resident said she was on her way to the nearby Greyhound station, where she planned to embark on a trip to South Carolina to attend her father’s funeral.

“I’m not even gonna make it there now,” Howard said.

After mistaking 14th Street for Anaheim Street, Howard said she made a U-turn, which is when the car collided with the train. Denette Snyder, 47, the owner of the car and a passenger at the time of the crash, said she was scratching off a lottery ticket and didn’t see the train moving toward the car. “I just felt the train hit us,” Snyder said.

Tony Moro, 51, was inspecting tracks nearby when he heard there had been a collision a few blocks north. A veteran of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Moro said that for the two people in the vehicle to walk off unscathed was not a common occurrence.

VERNON (CBSLA) -- John Moss was driving along Long Beach Avenue at 55th Street in Los Angeles on March 2, on his way to pick up his work partner early in the morning. He says he made a left hand turn, across a set of L.A. Metro train tracks — and had no idea a train was speeding his way.

""It's a miracle that I'm standing here and I have nightmares about this,"" he said. ""I'm very lucky to be alive.""
The 60-year-old suffered broken bones and major internal injuries. He said he continues to deal with pain, but he is thankful to be alive to tell his story.
""Fortunate for me, I got hit on the left side of my car and the train pushed me back out and that's how the car did not end up on the tracks,"" he said. ""If I didn't survive that accident, no one would know about this.""

SANTA FE SPRINGS, Calif. (KABC) -- A recreational vehicle that was left on train tracks in Santa Fe Springs was struck by a Metrolink train and burst into flames Friday morning.

Authorities say the fiery collision occurred shortly after 5:30 a.m. near the intersection of Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues. Fire crews believe the RV stalled at the Rosecrans Avenue intersection and was struck by the OC Line 681, which was carrying over 100 passengers and was heading from Orange County to Los Angeles.

Dramatic video shared on social media shows the moment the train slammed into the RV and pushed it along the track. The video appears to show people fleeing from the RV, and witnesses told police four people were seen running from the site of the collision moments before the crash.

Firefighters were seen dousing flames that gutted the vehicle and charred a rail car. Smoke from the fire could be seen for several miles.

Flames engulf Metrolink train after crash on tracks in Santa Fe Springs

A recreational vehicle that was left on train tracks in Santa Fe Springs was struck by a Metrolink train and burst into flames Friday morning.

""We got buffeted around pretty good, and it felt like we might derail for a second or two,"" train passenger Mike Lozano said.

Shortly after the collision, a freight train arrived on the parallel tracks.

""You could hear it coming, and it was coming really fast, you could tell,"" Lozano said.

Another passenger said he braced for potential impact as he heard the sound of the freight train quickly approaching.

""That was honestly the longest few seconds of my life, like when I heard the train horn coming, I was just looking around, everyone was looking around, are we even going to be safe? Do they know that this just happened? Because it sounded like they didn't,"" Ryan Hajek described.

The freight train ran over debris from the crash before coming to a stop as the fire from the Metrolink train started to spread.

AIR7 HD was over the scene, where dozens of evacuated passengers waited in a nearby parking lot while crews battled the flames. Four passengers who suffered minor injuries were treated and later released, according to officials.

""The hit was such an impact on the train,"" passenger Rosalind Carter said. ""I remember being flung into the seat next to me, I hit my head, it was just pretty traumatic.""

WATCH: Passenger describes frightening experience following Metrolink crash

A man who said he was a Metrolink passenger told Eyewitness News that a train crashed into a vehicle slammed on the brakes as it was approaching the intersection in Santa Fe Springs.

The crash caused significant train delays and cancellations. Metrolink offered ticket reimbursements for some customers and advised affected passengers to find their own transportation as ""alternate"" transportation was limited.

Many passengers who frequently ride the train said the crash could've been a lot worse but were thankful for the quick response of Metrolink employees and first responders.

""I got a couple more weeks of work, I'm retiring in December. So yeah, just wanna get through this thing and come out on the other end,"" Lozano said.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

Metrolink service experienced extensive delays Friday morning after a fiery crash between a Los Angeles-bound train and an RV in Santa Fe Springs prompted officials to shut down the tracks between Buena Park and Norwalk.Authorities received a report of a crash near the intersection of Rosecrans and Marquardt avenues around 5:37 a.m., Whittier police Officer Hugo Figueroa said. Police arrived to find a Metrolink train that had struck a stalled RV on the tracks, igniting a fire that consumed the RV and burned the front portion of the train. A freight train traveling parallel to the Metrolink train halted to a stop but was partially burned in the fire, Figueroa said. Metrolink identified the passenger train involved as the Orange County 681 Line train traveling to L.A. Aerial video from Sky5 showed passengers exit the train as the fire burned. Four people who complained of pain were treated at the scene and released, Figueroa said. The fire was mostly contained by 6:10 a.m. It’s unclear why the RV was on the tracks, but witnesses reported seeing four people fleeing from the vehicle, according to Whittier police. Officers were working on speaking to the registered owner, who lives near Santa Fe Springs, Figueroa said. The incident has shut down the tracks between the Buena Park and Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs stations, said Metrolink. L.A. County officials previously announced the tracks were expected to remain closed all day, but they later said one track was opened just before 9 a.m. Because of the closure, the 91PVL and 600 line trains were unable to get through the area, according to Metrolink . OC Line 603 to Los Angeles has been canceled at Fullerton for the day, the agency tweeted around 7:30 a.m. Passengers can get around the shutdown via MTA or OCTA buses. Other cancelations during the day included IEOC Line 811 to Laguna Niguel, RIV Line 406 to downtown Riverside, and SB lines 316, 320 and 328 to downtown San Bernardino. Several lines experienced delays, the result of train congestion caused by the track shut down. Afternoon trains were also impacted due to the closure. In addition, IEC Line 815 to Oceanside, OC lines 609 and 641 to Los Angeles, and OC Line 602 to Oceanside were all canceled mid-afternoon after a person was hit by by a train on the tracks, according to Metrolink. That incident prompted the closure of tracks between San Clemente and Oceanside. Because of the mass service disruption, officials have urged commuters to seek alternate transportation, adding that they could be reimbursed for costs. Those with valid fares for the 681, 601, 603, 701 and 700 trains are being offered vouchers of up to $50 for use of alternate transit such as Uber, Lyft or a taxi.

Photo from GoFundMe page.
On Sept. 4, a 19-year-old foster youth stepped in front of a freight train in Pomona and was killed. The only mention of the fatality was brief article published by OnScene.TV, which noted that an unknown pedestrian had been struck by a Union Pacific train at around 9:50 p.m.


Despite the lack of media attention, the death of the reportedly transgender young man — identified by a GoFundMe memorial as Yaeli Galdamez/Andrew Elijah Martinez — has prompted Los Angeles County leaders to conduct an immediate investigation into what they labeled as systemic issues in services for LGBTQ foster youth that could have prevented the death.


“Andrew M.’s death must be met with urgency to provide youth, including transition age youth in foster care, identified as LGBTQ+ with support and resources to live proud, productive, happy lives,” according to a motion proposed by Los Angeles County Supervisors Hilda Solis and Sheila Kuehl that will be introduced at the supervisors’ meeting on Tuesday.


The motion also calls for strengthening services such as more training for caregivers as well as providers across the region, and to find ways to minimize family rejection of youth who identify as LGBTQ. The need for specialized service for LGBTQ youth will also be discussed at a Monday meeting of the Los Angeles County Children’s Commission.


Details surrounding the circumstances of Andrew’s care and death were unavailable Friday. In a statement, officials with the county’s child welfare system cited state laws that protect the confidentiality of records for all children and families who come to the attention of child protective services.


“We are deeply saddened by the news reported of a tragic suicide,” said Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) officials in the statement. “Our mission to protect children is one we share with our partners in law enforcement and the community. We continue to collaborate toward our shared vision of ensuring every child is able to grow up in a safe and loving home.”


LGBTQ youth served by the DCFS have come into more focus in recent years. This year, county leaders approved the creation of a new “Office of Equity” to be housed within the $2.4 billion agency. The move is aimed at curbing the overrepresentation of LGBTQ and African American youth in foster care and to address the disparities these communities experience, officials said. The office is believed to be the first of its kind in the country and training of staff to be housed there is expected to begin in November.


DCFS Deputy Director Angela Parks-Pyles said strengthening services that will focus on these youth is the department’s priority.


“We’re digging deep to really understand this population and what they need,” Parks-Pyles said.


A recent study published in the journal Pediatrics found that 30 percent of California youth in foster care self-identify as LGBTQ, compared with 11 percent in the general population. But another often cited 2014 study published by the Williams Institute looked deeper into Los Angeles County and found that 19 percent of youth in foster care identify as LGBTQ. They also are more likely to report poor treatment in the foster care system at more than double the rate of non-LGBTQ youth.


A recent GoFundMe memorial page written for Andrew, who was also identified as Yaeli Galdamez, describes them as a transgender male who was caring and who helped many of his friends. But they also struggled with depression for several years.


“It was a long battle that was courageously fought,” according to what was written on the page. “That is why we are not just raising money for the memorial, but whatever we raise that is left over will be donated to an organization(s) that is making a difference in providing mental health support for youth who are in need and battling similar battles like the one Andrew did for as long as he could.”


Supervisor Solis said the motion is being introduced because any death prompts urgency.


“Any death is a failure and one too many,” Solis said in an email statement to The Imprint. “We know that transgender people face heightened risk of suicide. With Andrew’s death, it is clear that more must be done – now – to support foster youth who identify as LGBTQ+. Youth who identify as LGBTQ+ face many disparities, and those inequities are compounded when you are a youth in foster care.”

More than two dozen people were killed.

A fight between two train conductors unleashed a speeding, unmanned locomotive that slammed into a barrier and exploded in the Egyptian capital’s main train station Wednesday, killing at least 25 people, authorities said.

Railway officials said the single railcar collided head-on with the buffer stop, causing a huge explosion and fire. At least 47 people were also injured, many of them critically, and officials said the death toll could rise.

The deadly blaze blasted through people on the platform in the busy Ramses Station in downtown Cairo. A surveillance video showed the moment of impact when the car barreled past men and women walking by and engulfed them in flames and smoke. Charred bodies lay on the platform, and a man in flames ran down a staircase in panic, according to other photos and videos posted on social media.

But the conductor left without putting on the brakes, and the other car began moving backward, freeing the locomotive, which then gathered speed and hit the concrete-and-metal barrier, exploding.

“The driver left the railcar without taking any measures to brake it,” Sadek said in a statement.

Sadek put the death toll at 20 while health officials said at least 25 people had been killed and dozens more injured in the crash and ensuing fire. Some of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, and DNA tests were carried out to determine identities.

The driver of the railcar has been under interrogation, and Sadek said the investigation was continuing.

The deadly accident prompted Transportation Minister Hisham Arafat to resign his post, according to a statement released by the Cabinet office.

The accident triggered an online debate among Egyptians, with many blaming the government for not improving railway services, even after a series of deadly accidents. Several noted previous statements by President Abdel Fattah Sisi arguing about spending billions of pounds on improving trains.

Video from surveillance cameras showed flames ravaging the station’s interior. One video that surfaced on social media showed men and women carrying bags and personal belongings and walking on the rail platforms as the train car crashed and exploded.

Another showed men and women running and searching for exits after the explosion. A man is seen running back and forth, his shirt on fire, until another man rushes to pour water on him.

Mohammed Said, head of the Cairo railways hospital, said at least 25 people were killed but that the death toll could rise.

Many of the wounded were in critical condition, mostly suffering severe burns, said Egyptian Health Minister Hala Zayed.

Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli vowed harsh punishment for those behind the accident.

In July 2018, a passenger train derailed near the southern city of Aswan, injuring at least six people and prompting authorities to fire the chief of the country’s railways.

In March last year, Sisi said the government lacked about 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $14.1 billion, to overhaul the run-down rail system. He spoke a day after a passenger train collided with a cargo train, killing at least 12 people, including a child.

GARDENA, Calif. (KABC) -- Dozens of friends and family gathered at a home in Gardena to remember a young woman who fell off a train platform and was fatally struck.

Felicia Smith was just three weeks shy of her 25th birthday when the tragedy happened.

Candles were lit and balloons were sent into the sky during the vigil for her. Hymns were also sung to remember the 24-year-old. She died Monday when she slipped off a platform and was hit by an oncoming train in Sylmar.

""I wish I could have shown her that I'm doing good because that's all she wanted,"" one of Smith's sisters said.

Smith leaves behind an identical twin sister, Alicia. The pair shared an inseparable bond.

A collision with a train has killed a KC-area mother of two and injured her 6-year-old daughter and boyfriend.Jennifer Norris, 41, was the only one of the three occupants not thrown from a small pickup truck as it was struck by an Amtrak train in their hometown of Atherton, Mo., located in east Jackson County.While Norris was killed, her 6-year-old daughter, Lily Veach, survived with just minor scrapes and bruises. “There was clearly an angel with Lily,” said Angie Garcia, Norris’ sister, in a message to The Star.Norris’ boyfriend, Daniel Infranca, is in critical condition, and the family was awaiting an update Saturday afternoon.Norris had lived in the small, unincorporated community all her life.“They were just going to the gas station real quick and coming back home,” Garcia said. “Just like that, she’s gone.”She added that her heart aches for Norris’ parents and daughters. Norris also has a 19-year-old daughter.

MELROSE PARK, Ill. (WLS) -- A car was struck by a freight train and pushed several blocks after the man behind the wheel drove around the railroad crossing gates in west suburban Melrose Park, investigators said. His female passenger was killed in the crash and identified Friday morning.

Jocelynn Morales, 21, of the 300-block of 22nd Avenue in Bellwood, was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:51 a.m., the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said.

""You never think this is going to happen to you, that your kid is going to be involved in something like an accident,"" said Veronica Morales, Jocelynn's mother.

Up on the wall of the Morales' home is a photo of Jocelynn that captures her signature dimple smile, posing on the train tracks that would ultimately be the last place she was alive.

""Everybody is like 'Yeah, you have to be strong,' but I can't, that was my baby, that was my baby girl,"" Veronica said through tears.

Veronica said her daughter had her whole life ahead of her. Jocelynn was a third year student at Concordia University on a full ride scholarship through Fifth Third Bank's Tomorrow's Promise program. She was studying to be a psychologist.

Fifth Third Bank issued a statement Friday, saying, ""Fifth Third Bank is heart broken to hear of the news. Jocelynn was a bright, loving, incredible young woman. We were so proud to underwrite her college tuition because we knew she was someone who would make a difference in the world.""

""She was always reading or studying for a test, or writing a paper,"" her mother said.

A 21-year-old woman who was a passenger in a car was killed when the vehicle was struck by a freight train after the driver went around the gates in Melrose Park.

Her family said she was out with friends Thursday night and was on her way home when the car she was in collided with a freight train.

The impact occurred just before 2 a.m. on the border of Melrose Park and Maywood, at the crossing located at Main Street and North 19th Avenue. The Union Pacific freight train pushed the vehicle along the tracks to the area near North 15th and Railroad avenues.

It took more than 40 minutes to extricate Jocelynn from the car. An autopsy has not yet been scheduled.

Only two things were left at the scene late Friday morning: the tattered bumper of a gold Acura and a shredded warning gate.

The driver, identified as 20-year-old Ivan Tabares-Gomez, was pulled from the vehicle by a police officer who arrived first at the scene, Maywood Fire Chief Craig Bronaugh said. He was transported to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, where he is listed in critical condition. No other injuries were reported. Friends said Tabares-Gomez was Jocelynn's best friend.

""You couldn't separate them. Anything in the world, nothing in the world could separate them,"" said Jonathan Duarte, friend.

Family and friends gathered for a vigil Friday night, where Veronica's crippling pain was apparent.

""She told me all the time, 'Mom I am responsible, I know what I'm doing.' I just don't know how this could happen to her,"" she said through tears.

""Earlier today, after we left the hospital, everyone was talking about how the sun came out. We were saying that's her, she's telling us to relax, it's going to be ok,"" said Jasmine Velasquez, cousin. ""We're going to miss her a lot.""

Bronaugh said he hopes this serves as a lesson to others thinking of driving around the crossing gates.

""Under no circumstances do we want anyone, for any reason, to go around the railroad gates. The outcome is usually bad. There are times when the car wins, but the odds are not good. Again, we strongly recommend not doing that,"" Bronaugh said.

The NTSB said the train that derailed south of Seattle on Monday was traveling 80 miles per hour, 50 miles faster than the speed limit on the curve where it crashed.
Early indications suggest a train that derailed Monday morning near Dupont, Washington, killing several people, was traveling about 50 miles over the speed limit on the stretch of track where it crashed. If that proves correct, it will be the latest example of delayed implementation of a safety failsafe in the United States leading to a fatal train wreck.
The Amtrak Cascades train was traveling from Seattle to Portland, traveling a brand-new, faster route, when it jumped the rails south of Tacoma, sending cars careening off the tracks and off an overpass over Interstate 5, where it struck several vehicles. There’s still no confirmed death toll from the wreck. But the National Transportation Safety Board said late Monday night that the train was traveling 80 miles per hour, close to the 79 mph limit on the run, citing the train’s data recorder. The train was supposed to slow to 30 miles per hour as it curved over the highway.
Amtrak argued that any such judgments are too hasty. “It’s being investigated by the NTSB and anything beyond that, until their findings are out, is pure speculation,” Gary Banks Olson, assistant superintendent of operations, told the Seattle Times.
But while it is true that the NTSB’s full investigation will probably take months to complete, the cause of a wreck is often quickly clear from the data recorder, which is similar to those used in airplanes. Train-safety experts who examined photos and footage of the crash said that the arrangement of the cars—including the direction of one locomotive that left the tracks, and jackknifed cars on the overpass—suggested the train had been moving too fast headed into the curve. (The train had locomotives at both ends, a common configuration.)
Amtrak said Monday that Positive Train Control, a technological failsafe intended to avoid collisions, excessive speed, and other human errors, was installed on the stretch of track where the train derailed but was not in effect and was still in testing.
Mechanical and equipment failures are more common causes of train wrecks than human error, but human error often plays a role in the most spectacular crashes. In May 2015, Amtrak 188 derailed in Philadelphia, killing eight people. The NTSB concluded that the engineer had been distracted by radio traffic and failed to slow down headed into a curve. In 2016, a New Jersey Transit train going too fast crashed at Hoboken Terminal. In 2008, a Metrolink train collided with a freight train in Los Angeles, killing 25, an accident NTSB said was caused by its engineer texting and missing signals.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Pierce,WA,53,Dupont,Interstate 5,J,Vehicles,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,1,Amtrak Cascades train cars,Public,A,Amtrak Cascades train with locomotives at both ends,1,Train struck several vehicles on the overpass,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Passenger Train-Pulling,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,80,R,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Yes,Yes,"The Amtrak Cascades train was traveling from Seattle to Portland, traveling a brand-new, faster route, when it jumped the rails south of Tacoma, sending cars careening off the tracks and off an overpass over Interstate 5, where it struck several vehicles.

WATCH: ‘We need EMS ASAP’: conductor tells dispatcher following Amtrak train derailment

1:25 Audio of radio chatter between Amtrak train, dispatcher in moments following derailment

Eighty passengers and five crew members were on board the train when it derailed. Amtrak raised the number of passengers aboard Monday evening as two employees were on the train but were on employee passes.

The train was made up of 12 cars and two engines. Thirteen of those cars jumped the track.

One of the cars contained diesel fuel. At its maximum the car could hold 350 gallons of fuel, but officials couldn’t confirm if it was full.

This was Amtrak Train 501, which is a new service starting today running from Seattle to Portland. The train was on its inaugural trip.

The engines were equipped with positive train control – the technology that can slow or stop a speeding train – but it wasn’t in use on this stretch of track, according to Amtrak President Richard Anderson.

Anderson said he was “deeply saddened by all that has happened today,” during a conference call with reporters on Monday.

Radio transmissions from the train just moments after the derailment have now been released.

“Emergency, emergency, emergency, we are on the ground,” one of the crew members can be heard saying. “We need EMS ASAP, it looks like they’re already starting to show up.”

When asked what happened, the crew members says “we were coming around the corner to take the bridge over I-5 there, right north into Nisqually and we went on the ground.”

“We’ve got cars everywhere and even down on to the highway.”

Chris Karnes was a passenger on the train when the incident happened.

“All of a sudden we were slammed into the seats in front of us and then the car careened down an embankment,” he said. “We could hear and feel the cars crumbling and breaking apart. There was a lot of dust all over the place.”

He said they had to kick out the emergency window because the emergency doors were not functioning. “Multiple people injured,” he said. “Cuts, people bleeding, I did see one person laying on the ground who was not moving.”

“It just jumped the curb and ‘bam,'” one witness told King5. She said the train went off the track just as it curves.

It is unclear exactly how the train derailed but reports state the train hit a truck. The train was reportedly travelling 130 km/h at the time of the derailment but it can go much faster.

According to The Associated Press, the maximum speed along that stretch, which is known as Point Defiance Bypass, is 79 mph, or about 127 km/h. This is according to information about the project posted online by the Washington State Department of Transportation.

“At a certain point it seemed we were reaching a sort of a bend in the tracks and all of a sudden we were slammed into the seats in front of us, and then the car careened down an embankment,” he said.

I-5 southbound is closed at the Mounts Road overpass, with one lane northbound also closed.

The Washington State Department of Transportation is warning everyone to avoid the area and restrict travel if possible.

Amtrak service south of Seattle is temporarily suspended. Service from Seattle to points north and east is continuing to operate. Amtrak Cascades 504 and 509 are cancelled.

An Amtrak train derailed south of Seattle, Washington, on Monday, sending train cars tumbling onto a busy interstate. Sheriff's department officials said there were multiple fatalities and injuries. A spokesperson with St. Joseph's Medical Center said 77 patients are being transported to hospitals in Pierce and Thurston counties, including four with severe injuries.
The train that derailed had just left the Tacoma station and was on the very first run of new high-speed Cascade service, en route from Seattle to Portland, Oregon.
The train is able to carry up to 250 people, but Amtrak said there were approximately 78 passengers and five crew members on board at the time.
Passenger Chris Karnes, who was on board the train when it derailed, said emergency doors were not functioning correctly, which forced passengers to kick out train windows to exit.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (KABC) -- A woman in her 70s was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in North Hollywood Friday night, officials said.

The Pacific Surfliner train 790 struck a woman who was trying to cross the tracks one mile north of the Burbank station at 7:05 p.m.., officials said.

The location was at Vineland Avenue, just west of Bob Hope Airport.

The train had 241 passengers on board and no injuries to passengers or crew.

The woman was crossing the tracks and waited for a westbound train to pass by, then attempted to cross the tracks, according to Los Angeles Police Department detectives.

Unfortunately, she did not see another train heading in the opposite direction on the second set of tracks at the same time, according to LAPD Det. Bill Bustos.

CHESTER, Pa. -- At least two people were confirmed dead and about 17 others injured after an Amtrak train struck a backhoe, derailing the lead engine in Pennsylvania Sunday morning.

The accident was reported at 7:53 a.m. Sunday near Booth Street on the Palmetto Train 89 in Chester. The train was operating from New York to Savannah, Georgia.

Amtrak suspended all service between Philadelphia and New York City until later in the afternoon when it ran a limited service.

Amtrak officials said the train struck a backhoe that was on the tracks and the impact derailed the lead engine of the train.

Chester Fire Commissioner Travis Thomas said in a late Sunday morning press conference that the scene extended to Trainer, Pa.

Officials with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management confirm there were two fatalities. Officials said they were not passengers, and Amtrak said they were workers in the vicinity of the backhoe.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters in New York that he had spoken with Amtrak board chairman Anthony Coscia regarding. He said both workers killed were Amtrak employees.

Schumer said debris from the crash flew into the first two cars, injuring some passengers. According to Amtrak, approximately 31 people are hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.

Schumer said it's unclear whether the backhoe was performing regular maintenance or whether it was cleaning up debris from high overnight winds. He called for a complete investigation.

ABC7 sister station WPVI-TV spoke with witnesses and victims of the crash. Linton Holmes of Wilson, North Carolina was on the train when it derailed in Delaware County.

""The train was rumbling. We got off track, I guess. It was just a bunch of dust. There was dust everywhere. Then the train conductors, they were running to the front, because I was all the way in the back. Five more minutes, we were just waiting there. Then the train conductor came up and told us there was a fatality and wanted to see if anyone else was injured,"" Holmes said.

Holmes recalled an explosion of some kind.

""It was an explosion. We got off track and then there was like a big explosion. Then there was a fire and windows burst out. Some people were cut up, but it was just minor injuries,"" Holmes said.

Mariam Akhtar from Washington, D.C. was on the sixth car.

""It felt like the train hit something and there were like three or four really big bangs and it kind of threw us off the seats we were sitting in. There was a lot of smoke and everybody was yelling. The train kind of stopped and later on, everybody was running to the front. Then the people were in the front started walking toward the back,"" Akhtar said.

Akhtar added that the crew handled the situation well and none were panicked. She said she was on the train for about 30 minutes before she was able to exit.

WPVI-TV also spoke with a man on the phone whose 52-year-old mother was on the train. He says she was on her way from New York City to her home in Maryland.

His mother said she has injuries to her knees, head and back, but he was able to talk to her on the phone. She told him it was a scary and chaotic scene; she was stuck on the train for some time before being taken out in an ambulance.

WPVI-TV also obtained scanner audio from first responders who were called to the scene shortly after the crash.

- Share via
The Metrolink commuter railroad announced Monday that it was improving four street crossings in Moorpark and Simi Valley to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from getting onto the tracks.
The crossings, which are part of the Ventura County sealed corridor project, are at Moorpark Avenue in Moorpark and 1st Street, Erringer Road and Sycamore Drive in Simi Valley.
Officials said the work will include street widening, automatic exit gates for vehicles, sidewalks, handrails, automatic pedestrian gates and improved traffic signals. The upgrades, which cost about $12.4 million, are scheduled to be finished by the end of the year.
“We are always trying to improve safety at rail crossings. Now we are getting the chance to make those improvements,” said Darren Kettle, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission, which is participating in the project.
Also working with Metrolink are the California Department of Transportation, the California Transportation Commission, Moorpark, Simi Valley, Amtrak and Union Pacific Railroad.
Metrolink, which has 512 miles of track, serves six Southern California counties, including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura.
Kettle said the four crossings were given the highest priority for improvement mostly because of their large traffic volumes. They are part of a broader sealed corridor project at Metrolink to upgrade rail crossings throughout its entire system.
Concern about rail crossing safety increased this year when a Metrolink train collided with a heavy-duty pick-up truck and trailer that had strayed onto the tracks at the Rice Avenue crossing near Oxnard. The engineer was fatally injured and 27 passengers were hurt in the Feb. 24 accident.
A $35-million project to separate the tracks and street with an overpass has been delayed for years because of a lack of money.
Though work on the Simi Valley and Moorpark crossings had begun shortly before the Oxnard crash, Kettle said the collision and others like it always focus attention on the safety of existing crossings and what can be done to improve them.

The new details provide insight into the events that led to the death of 37-year-old bodybuilder, inspirational coach, actor and model Greg Plitt. Investigators have said they believed his death was an accident based on their preliminary investigation.
Plitt, who was to be featured in a new Bravo reality series that premiered Monday called “Friends to Lovers,” was struck at about 4 p.m. Saturday on the tracks at Front Street, just north of the Burbank Metrolink Station.
Until Tuesday's confirmation from police, it was not clear whether Plitt was running alongside the tracks or between the rails. He was with two others during the shoot and did not respond to a horn blast from the Metrolink train before it caught up to him, Burbank police said.

He died at the scene.  Police learned he was shooting a promotional video for sponsor Shadow Beverages, which includes brands such as No Fear and WheyUp.
""We are extremely saddened by the suddent and tragic loss of our spokesperson and part owner of the WheyUp brand, Greg Plitt,"" reads in part a statement posted on the WheyUp website.  The statement did not address the circumstances of the video shoot or the death.   

A call Tuesday to the energy drink company's office in Phoenix was not immediately returned.
A filming permit had not been issued, according to police, and Metrolink had not been contacted tp arrange for a traffic stop and other required safety precautions before a crew is allowed to enter railway right of way, said a spokesman for the regional rail service that owns and operates the tracks where the incident occurred, just north of the Burbank Station.
A former U.S. Army Ranger, Plitt grew to fame as a fitness guru, model and motivational speaker. Plitt had previously worked out next to, and even on, train tracks, according to videos he posted. The videos include scene that appear to have been shot at the same location as the site where he was killed.

A public memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday at The Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. A second service is scheduled for next week in his hometown of Baltimore.

In promotional workout videos shot outside Los Angeles, he lifted barbells and did pushups as a train whizzed by in the background. But on Saturday afternoon, police said, George Gregory Plitt Jr. was running ahead of a commuter train on that same stretch of railroad during a small film shoot when he was struck and killed.

“The conductor can see somebody on the tracks a distance away,” Burbank police officer Joshua Kendrick told the Associated Press. The conductor pulled the brakes and blew the horn, but “for one reason or another, unfortunately, Mr. Plitt did not get off the tracks.”

The train hit Plitt. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Plitt, who went by Greg, was a West Point graduate and U.S. Army Ranger with an affinity for adventure. He was a longtime rock climber and skydiver, parachuting from planes more than 1,000 times. He was also a recognizable face in the fitness industry, appearing on some 200 magazine covers. He was a former Calvin Klein model and an actor.

“He was fearless,” producer and friend Michael Ewing told the Los Angeles Times. “That’s why it’s so sad, but he could not outrun this last thing.”

Plitt had appeared in Bravo’s reality TV show “Work Out,” NBC’s soap opera “Days of Our Lives” and films such as “The Good Shepherd,” “Terminator Salvation” and “Grudge Match.” He was set to appear on Bravo’s “Friends to Lovers,” which premieres Monday, Variety reported.

“We couldn’t take our eyes off Greg Plitt after we cast him on ‘Work Out’ — was as nice as he was beautiful,” Bravo talk show host Andy Cohen tweeted Sunday. “Seemed invincible, like Superman.”

Late Saturday afternoon, Plitt was with a small crew, two or three people, near the Burbank Metrolink Station. Some individuals told various news outlets he was filming an action sequence. Others said he was shooting a commercial for an energy drink. A photo, which allegedly shows Plitt on the railroad track before he was hit, was published by KTLA-TV, showing a shirtless man running alongside some tracks.

It’s still unclear what led to Plitt’s death.

“We don’t know what they were filming out there and suicide has been ruled out,” Burbank police Sgt. Chris Canales told KTTV.

Individuals told TMZ that Plitt was attempting to outrun the train for the video. Friends said he miscalculated, tripped and fell — and couldn’t get up in time. Police said he may have thought the train was on another track.

“It’s like a blind turn,” Burbank police Sgt. Scott Meadows said. “When the train came, you might not be able to tell which set the train is on.”

No one on the train was injured, but some witnessed the accident.

“He had on all black,” Metrolink passenger Victor Crowell told KABC-TV. “The train went by. I saw him stumble over the tracks. He had a camcorder in his hand.”

Investigators reviewed video footage from atop the train and seized film shot by Plitt’s camera crew.

“It was just a freaky moment where something got out of control,” Warren Coulter, Plitt’s friend for 15 years, told the AP.

Walking or standing on or near the tracks without permission is considered trespassing, a misdemeanor offense. Officials said Plitt did not have authorization to be filming there, which he had reportedly done before. Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said when train system officials see photos or videos of people on the tracks, they try to warn them about the dangers, though he didn’t know whether Plitt was warned in the past.

“The tracks are for one thing — trains,” he said.

Plitt’s girlfriend, Christina Stejskal, told the L.A. Times he was “trying to get the best shot.”

Two men were filming Greg Plitt on the railway track north of the Burbank train station Saturday afternoon when Plitt was hit by a southbound train, said Burbank Police Sgt. Scott Meadows.
Plitt was a well-known fitness model.
Investigators, who interviewed witnesses who saw Plitt standing on the track even as the train's horn was blaring, have ruled out a suicide, he said.
It appears Plitt may have believed the train was on a nearby, parallel track, Meadows said.
""It's like a blind turn,"" he said. ""When the train came, you might not be able to tell which set the train is on.""
It was not immediately clear what the men were filming. Investigators are trying to determine who directed the men to film on the railroad track.
The actor and West Point graduate has appeared on more than 200 magazine covers, Bravo's reality television show ""Work Out"" and NBC's daytime soap opera ""Days of Our Lives,"" according to a website in Plitt's name.
Plitt was born in Baltimore. He served five years in the Army after graduating from West Point

""He was deff running either between the rails or just on the outside,"" wrote James A. Brown in the comment section of an NBCLA article on the outpouring of grief in response to Plitt's death.
Whether Plitt tripped on the rocky, uneven roadbed, or simply veered too close to the tracks, was not clear on the low resolution video, said Brown.
Plitt did not respond to a horn blast from the train, according to Burbank Police. He and two others were involved in a video shoot Saturday afternoon, police said Sunday. Neither of the two has commented publicly on the scenario for the shoot, nor on a report it was to be a promotional video for a sports drink.

Plitt and the others had sporadically come into the view of the security camera during the two hours prior to the fatal accident, according to Brown.
Arrangements had not been made for a traffic stop and other safety requirements for video production on a railroad right of way, according to Scott Johnson, spokesman for Metrolink, which owns and operates the stretch of railroad just north of the Burbank Metrolink station.
Videos posted on Plitt's website attest to previous video shoots on that same stretch of tracks just north of the Burbank Metrolink station. Plitt lived in Burbank.
A graduate of the West Point Military Academy who served in the Army Rangers, the Maryland native gravitated to body building and moved to Southern California when he returned to civilian life. He built a personal brand that included inspirational coaching, modeling and acting. He appeared in the Stallone-DeNiro film ""Gudge Match,"" and more recently recorded yet-to-be aired segments of the Bravo reality program ""Friends to Lovers.""
Plitt was a sponsored athlete of the Met-Rx nutritional supplement company and served as a spokesman.
He stocked his website with an ever-expanding collection of videos chronicling his real-life athletic exploits.
""Everything had to be spectacular. I mean, he was a perfectionist,"" said CB Harding, a director/producer who considered Plitt a friend and was working with him to develop a new reality show project.
""He was the real deal,"" said Harding's wife Louise. ""He went at life just full on.""
Why he returned to shoot videos on the railroad tracks, the Hardings could not say.
""I don't honestly know what was the attraction,"" said CB Harding.
""A mistake was made,"" said another Plitt friend, Warren Coulter. ""A simple, horrible, horrible, tragic mistake.""
Meeting Plitt made an impression, with his striking looks, ripped physique, and boundless energy and enthusiasm. ""People were stunned by him,"" said Mike Ewing, the film producer and Plitt friend who also helped him bring to market a new fitness tool called the Metaball.
""His dream was to be able to move on to do more acting,"" said Ewing.
An animal lover who adopted dogs, Plitt was a supporter of the Linda Blair Worldheart Foundation, said Coulter.

Warren Coulter, who had been friends for 15 years with 37-year-old George Gregory Plitt Jr., who went by 'Greg' said: 'It was just a freaky moment where something got out of control.'
Coulter told The Associated Press that Plitt was a West Point graduate and Army Ranger who had jumped out of planes more than 1,000 times in his life and had a taste for the extreme, but also treated everyone and everything with respect and care as befitted his military past.
'Everything Greg did, he did extremely well,' Coulter said. 'This isn't anyone who ever took a nap.'
Coulter said he spoke to members of the film crew and says Plitt misjudged the situation and tripped and fell before he was hit by the train.
'No question of it, it was just a mistake,' Coulter said.
Investigators have ruled out a suicide, and were trying to determine who directed the men to film without a permit in a restricted area of the tracks Saturday afternoon.
They have interviewed witnesses who saw Plitt standing on the track even as the train's horn was blaring, Burbank police Sgt. Scott Meadows said.
Plitt, a native of Baltimore who settled in Los Angeles more than 10 years ago, appeared on more than 200 magazine covers, Bravo's reality television shows 'Work Out' and 'Friends to Lovers' and NBC's daytime soap opera 'Days of Our Lives,' according to his personal website.
A motivational video on the website shows Plitt working out on the tracks as a Metrolink train passes by.
Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said Monday that the Los Angeles-region commuter train system tries to warn people when it sees they have posted images or videos of themselves on its tracks, but he didn't know whether Plitt had been contacted in the past.
Walking on tracks is trespassing, Johnson said.
'The tracks are for one thing — trains,' he said.
It appears Plitt may have believed the train was on a nearby, parallel track, Meadows said.
'It's like a blind turn,' he said. 'When the train came, you might not be able to tell which set the train is on.'

BURBANK, Calif. — A man who was hit and killed by a train on Saturday in Burbank has been identified as reality TV star George Gregory “Greg” Plitt Jr., said the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner.

Police do not believe the incident was a suicide, and witnesses say Plitt Jr. was filming at the time of the accident, though it’s not yet clear what was being filmed.

The 37-year-old actor, reality television star, and fitness model was walking just north of the downtown Burbank station and Magnolia Boulevard overpass when he was hit by a Metrolink train around 4:00 p.m. Saturday, according to police.

Plitt graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point. He was best known for his roles in “Terminator Salvation,” “The Good Shepherd,” and “Grudge Match”.

He also starred in the Bravo reality television show “Work Out,” and was set to appear in a new series on Bravo called “Friends to Lovers,” according to his network biography.

Pitt was also a fitness expert who modeled for health magazines, including Men’s Fitness, Muscle & Fitness and Men’s Health, the IMDb page stated.

“He lived with purpose,” said T.J. Hoban, Plitt’s friend and fellow fitness model. “Nothing brought him greater pleasure and fulfillment than doing what he loved, which was helping people live a healthier, happier life, empowering them through fitness, motivating people, helping them through difficult times.”

Plitt’s last film, “The Best Thanksgiving Ever,” was in post-production and slated for a 2015 release.",Metrolink,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,4,PM,Burbank station,Unknown,Los Angeles,CA,06,Burbank,Magnolia Boulevard,K,Pedestrian,Unknown,Unknown,3,Moving over crossing,1,Metrolink train,Public,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Metrolink,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,37,1,Male,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,3,Unknown,7,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,0,0,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,No,Unknown,Unknown,Yes,Unknown,"A man who was hit and killed by a train on Saturday in Burbank has been identified as reality TV star George Gregory “Greg” Plitt Jr. Police do not believe the incident was a suicide, and witnesses say Plitt Jr. was filming at the time of the accident, though it’s not yet clear what was being filmed.

He was strong and confident, a West Point grad, former Army Ranger and TV bodybuilder with rippling arms and washboard abs.
But when Greg Plitt tripped while running along a Metrolink track in Burbank on Saturday, he could do nothing to avoid being struck and killed by an oncoming commuter train.
Although police are still investigating, friends say Plitt was filming video for his workout, nutrition and motivational website, trying to get action shots.
“He just made a mistake,” said Warren Coulter, his friend.
Coulter was not at the site when the tragedy occurred but said he spoke to film crew members who were. He said Plitt may have tried to act like Superman, who in the 1950s-era TV show was said to be “faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive.”
Plitt always “wanted to push things to the limit,” his girlfriend, Christina Stejskal, said as she wept during an interview Monday. “He’s just like Superman.”
George Gregory Plitt Jr., 37, was struck by a southbound train about 4 p.m. just north of the Burbank Metrolink station, police said.
A train hitting people or cars is nothing new in the Los Angeles region, where most tracks run at street level. About 30 people a year are killed by Metrolink, Amtrak or freight trains. Many are acts of suicide, while others are drivers trying to race through crossings or pedestrians who can’t hear the horns or misjudge the train’s speed.
“Unsafe behavior along the tracks is a problem we talk about all the time,” said Jeff Lustgarten, a Metrolink spokesman.
But Plitt’s death was different. He had used the same stretch of Burbank track for filming other fitness videos that captured him lifting barbells and doing push-ups on the rails. In one segment, he performed box jumps as a Metrolink train passed behind him.
Railroad officials said Plitt and the two members of his film crew did not have permission to be on or near the commuter line’s tracks. It is considered trespassing, a misdemeanor offense, to be on railroad rights-of-way without authorization.
“He had no permit to be there,” Lustgarten said. “We have a whole process for people to go through if they want to be on our right-of-way, especially for film crews.”
Metrolink’s permit procedures include safety briefings and — depending on the circumstances, such as being on the right-of-way — flagmen to warn of approaching trains.
“Our hearts go out to Greg Plitt’s family and his friends,” Lustgarten said. His death is “tragic on a lot of different levels.”
Coulter said Plitt, who was also an actor and model, was featured in more than 250 magazines. He was the star of the Bravo reality show “Work Out” and appeared on the soap opera “Days of Our Lives,” as well as in the films “Terminator Salvation” and “Grudge Match.”
Coulter said his friend had an attitude toward life that “there was nothing he couldn’t do.” That’s why Plitt’s death came as a shock to his many friends and fans, he added.
Michael Ewing, a producer who was close friends with the reality TV star, said Plitt, a rock climber and avid sky diver, was “the most alive person” he’d ever met. He said Plitt’s lean and buffed body was the model for the ultra-fit Dr. Manhattan in the 2009 film “Watchmen.”
“He was fearless,” Ewing said. “That’s why it’s so sad, but he could not outrun this last thing.”
Lustgarten said the Burbank station is on a stretch of track where trains travel at more moderate speeds because there is a string of stations in that area.
According to Metrolink, the train’s engineer saw the film crew, sounded his horn and applied the emergency brakes.
The Federal Railroad Administration said trespassing on railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in the United States. Nationally, more than 400 people are killed annually and nearly as many are injured. The vast majority of these deaths and injuries are preventable, federal officials say.

“While our hearts go out to his [Plitt’s] family, this was very, very preventable,” Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten told TheWrap Tuesday.

“Had the proper channels been followed, this would not have happened,” Lustgarten said as he explained that Plitt was not authorized to be on the train tracks.

The actor, 37, was killed Saturday near the Burbank Metrolink Station on Front Street as he purportedly shot a fitness video. Some reports have indicated he was filming a commercial for an energy drink.

Police have previously said the former Army Ranger and Calvin Klein model was accompanied by two other individuals, one of whom was filming the fitness guru. As part of their investigation, the Burbank Police Department is analyzing surveillance footage handed over by Metrolink.

Plitt “was running on the tracks and did not respond to a horn blast,” officer Joshua Kendrick told TheWrap Tuesday. “We’re unable to determine if he fell because of the angle of the video.”

Warren Coulter, a friend of Plitt’s, told the Los Angeles Times, “He just made a mistake.” Coulter said he talked to the crew members who were at the scene, and they told him Plitt was attempting to get action shots, possibly playing off of the old Superman expression that the superhero is “more powerful than a locomotive.”

While the investigation into his death continues, Plitt’s family is planning a public memorial. The service will be held at The Church of The Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills on Saturday at 2 p.m. Another service is scheduled for next week in his hometown of Baltimore.

“We are devastated over the loss of our son,” Plitt’s family posted on his website. “Your messages have uplifted us and give us strength. We thank you for that. Greg’s soul is now with our heavenly Father. May his spirit live on through his website and through each of you.”

Plitt recently shot several episodes for a new Bravo series called “Friends to Lovers,” and is scheduled to make his first appearance on an episode that will air in about six weeks. On his website, the fitness guru can be seen in workout videos shot along the same stretch of tracks where he died.

Lustgarten told TheWrap Plitt “did not have permission to shoot those videos” or the one the actor was working on Saturday. “When a permit is filed, we normally assign a flagman to the shoot.” The flagman knows Metrolink’s train schedules, communicates with operations and lets the film crew know if a train is coming.

However, Lustgarten said none of that happened. “This was an unauthorized shoot,” he continued. When asked if he was certain that a permit request had not been submitted for the weekend shoot, Lustgarten added, “We’ve double and triple-checked.”

The Metrolink spokesman also said that the train’s engineer and conductor have been placed on administrative leave.

“Whenever there’s an incident like this, we automatically take the crew out of commission for an unspecified amount of time,” Lustgarten said. “They are undergoing trauma counseling.”

The family of actor and fitness model Greg Plitt have received thousands of messages from well-wishers and now are planning a public memorial Saturday in Beverly Hills.
The family thanked Plitt’s fans for their support after his accidental death Saturday in Burbank.
“We are devastated over the loss of our son,” they said in a statement posted on his website.
“Your messages have uplifted us and give us strength; we thank you for that. Greg’s soul is now with our heavenly Father. May his spirit live on through his website and through each of you.”
Plitt was killed when he was struck by a passing Metrolink train. Friends said he was trying to get an action shot, possibly for his website or commercial, when he tripped and was hit.
Authorities say he did not have permits to film on the tracks.
Plitt always “wanted to push things to the limit,” his girlfriend, Christina Stejskal, said Monday. “He’s just like Superman.”
For many in the fitness community, Plitt was motivating and inspiring.
Described as friendly and humble, Plitt would talk with fans at length.
Plitt, who was also an actor and model, was featured in more than 250 magazines.
He was the star of the Bravo reality show “Work Out” and appeared on the soap opera “Days of Our Lives,” as well as in the films “Terminator Salvation” and “Grudge Match.”
Plitt’s lean and buffed body was the model for the ultra-fit Dr. Manhattan in the 2009 film “Watchmen.”
The West Point graduate and former U.S. Army Ranger was somewhat of a daredevil.
Plitt was not afraid to take risks, both in his work and at play, his friends say.
He was also seen as a family man, sometimes talking to his mother up to four times a day, his friend Warren Coulter said.
Plitt’s public memorial service will begin at 2 p.m. at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Another service will be held next week in his hometown of Baltimore.

Two events were held to raise funds for Jimenez-Soto’s family — a car wash and a food sale.
“She was a sweetheart. she was the most amazing, beautiful girl ever,” said Juliana Georgy, a 15-year-old friend of Jimenez-Soto.
The teen was a junior at Golden Valley High School.
“I miss her smile around me. She was a really good person,” she said. “I wasn’t that close to her but she mean a lot, we lost someone.”
A coroner’s official said Sunday that preliminary reports indicate Jimenez-Soto’s death was a suicide. Homicide officials are still investigating, but they were not available Sunday.
A GoFundMe page was setup to help the family raise funds for the teens funeral.
The food sale held at Canyon Country Park from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. was run by friends and family. The family and friends sold tacos and sodas among other foods.
“We would always go to the movies after school. We would just go to the theater and watch what was playing,” said George Polacmo, a 17-year-old classmate and friend of Jimenez-Soto. “She would come in the middle of the night to talk to me. I was really close with her.”
Many of Jimenez-Soto’s family and close friends did not want to comment and requested privacy.
“She always had a smile on her face,” said 15-year-old classmate Kiera Davis. “She kind of stayed to herself.”
Dozens of community members came to the Canyon Country Park to show their support.
“We’re just here to support. The news came around from friends to friends,” said Felix Garcia. “It s a small Spanish community. We decided why not come over and help. We’re with the Outlaws organization, cheerleading and football. I help (Jimenez-Soto’s aunt) with cooking at the events. We all have kids and we never know when we’ll be next. As a small community, we want to come out and support them and chip in.”
A car wash was held in the parking lot of Pep Boys near Home Depot in Canyon Country, just a couple blocks from where Jimenez-Soto was killed.
Close friends and family washed several cars throughout the day to raise funds for the teen’s funeral.
A close friend of the teen was one of the organizers of the car wash and did not want to comment.
The family plans to host more events to raise money for the teen’s funeral, Garcia said.
Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Homicide Division officials reported the cause of death as “an apparent suicide” and that she was “standing in front of the train when it struck her,” said Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner’s Office.
Jimenez-Soto was struck by a train at 10:20 a.m. Friday, near the corner of Ruether Avenue and Soledad Canyon Road, according to Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station officials.
A memorial was set up next to the train tracks where she was found near Rainbow Glen.
Initial reports indicated Jimenez-Soto’s death might have been accidental, as opposed to a suicide attempt.
Eastbound Soledad Canyon Road at Rainbow Glen was shut down Friday as officials worked around the collision scene.
Homicide Bureau detectives did handling Jimenez-Soto’s case did not immediately respond to a request for a statement.

It was amazing seeing all these young teens and mothers all work hard for this fundraiser!Praying for the family to heal through all the days ahead.It was devastating to hear of such a young life die this way.My heart goes out to her mom&sister.
My husband was the conductor on the train that hit Kimberly. He will never forget that morning for the rest of his life. He is distraught and devastated with the thought that this young girl will never grow up, get married, have children …. experience life. We have a daughter the same age, and can’t imagine the pain her family is feeling. Our hearts go out to Kimberly’s family and friends. You are all in our prayers, continually.

Several people were injured in Long Beach on Friday after a car collided with a train on the Blue Line, officials said.
The crash between the northbound train and car was reported about 7 a.m. near 14th Street and Long Beach Boulevard, said Metro spokesman Jose Ubaldo. Details about how the crash occurred were not immediately available.
Five people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries, according to Matthew Dobberpuhl of the Long Beach Fire Department.
Five people on the train reported minor injuries, such as back and neck pain, Ubaldo said. At least one person from the vehicle was transported to the hospital, though it was unclear if it was the driver or a passenger, Ubaldo said.
Train service is delayed between downtown Long Beach and Anaheim stations while one track is blocked by the investigation, he said. Service between downtown Los Angeles and Willow stations is not impacted.
The train has been evacuated, and regular service should be running again shortly, he said.
Long Beach police, Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies and the Blue Line Transit supervisors were on scene, Dobberpuhl said.

The emotional memorial took place at Atlanta Botanical Garden’s Mershon Hall and was attended by friends, family and members of the Local 600 branch of the IATSE union, as well as one of the people injured in the accident that killed Jones.

John Strickland, a local reverend, read from the poem “Afterglow,” reciting “I’d like the tears of those who grieve to dry before the sun.” He spoke of mortality and not putting off telling loved ones you care about them.
“When we’re young adults, we think we’ll live forever. But parents die. Friends die. Sometimes even children die. So tell the ones that you love that you love them,” Strickland said.
The memorial took place just hours ahead of the Academy Awards, where a group had been petitioning the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to recognize Jones during its “In Memoriam” segment. A Facebook and Twitter campaign also urged attendees to wear black ribbons in her honor.
Strickland alluded to the Oscars during his remembrance, telling the crowd, “When those stars walk across the stage, it’s because of people like you.”
Union leader Bruce Doering also addressed the crowd with visible emotion. Doering, executive director of IATSE Local 600, said there had been an outpouring of support from union members around the world and people who knew Jones.
Doering said IATSE, which annually gives out a scholarship, would rename the next edition of it the Sarah Elizabeth Jones Scholarship. It will be given to a son or daughter of a union member who shows interest in doing camera work.
He quoted one person who’d written him about Jones, who said “She flew into our hearts and everyone who worked with her and knew her.” Lloyd Ahern, the director of photography on Army Wives, who worked with Jones, told Doering the late crewmember’s presence was “like sprinkling fairy dust” on whatever situation she found herself in.
Doering also read a letter from a young woman, who wrote: “Sarah, you’re the first example I had of a female camera assistant. You stole my heart. I will aim to be someone you can be proud of.”
He went on to say the union was committed to learning what caused the accident.
“Since this terrible accident happened, we’re trying to figure out how this happened and we’re committed to taking the issue of unsafe conditions as far as we can take it — and like Sarah — full-on,” Doering said.
Jones died Feb. 20 when she was struck and killed by a train during preproduction on the Gregg Allman biopic Midnight Rider. The accident occurred on a train trestle over the Altamaha River near the Doctortown Road crossing in Wayne County, Ga. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into the accident, which also left seven other crewmembers injured. Questions have been raised as to whether the production had permission to be filming on the train tracks.
Doering said the Local 491 union had been assisting in investigating the incident in Savannah, and that there will be a candlelight vigil held in Jones’ honor Friday in Los Angeles.

 Metrolink train 603 heading from Oceanside to Los Angeles struck the trio on tracks under the Alicia Parkway overcrossing at 6:06 a.m., agency spokeswoman Angie Starr said. The group included two young women and a young man, authorities said.

 

 The dead were identified late Thursday as Anastasia Bolton, 17, of Del Mar and Daniel Akins, 22, of Mission Viejo, sheriff's Lt. Colin Murphy said.

 

 A 27-year-old Santa Ana woman, who was injured, called 911, authorities said. She was transported with moderate injuries to Mission Hospital.

All three had apparently met on Facebook and got together Wednesday night in Santa Ana before heading to Laguna Beach and then the train tracks in Mission Viejo, according to investigators.

The teenage girl who survived the accident said all three of them had fallen asleep on the tracks, and she woke up just before the train hit them, according to Orange County sheriff’s spokesman Jim Amormino.

Investigators are looking into what the three teens were doing in the area. Members of the sheriff's Major Accident Reconstruction Team have been called to investigate the scene.

That section of railroad tracks is near a park that is frequented by teenagers and young adults drinking and taking drugs, a neighbor told the Los Angeles Times. Preliminary tests show the teenage girl who survived the accident did not have alcohol or drugs in her system.

Mom and fiance remember the young woman killed by a train in Navasota.

NAVASOTA, Texas -- The train tracks that criss-cross the heart of Navasota is part of daily life in this small town. A week ago, Fredzania Thompson saw the tracks as the perfect backdrop for a photoshoot to launch her modeling ambitions.

""I actually talked to her that morning,"" recalled fiancé Earl Champman. ""She told me she was headed to the photo shoot.""

That short conversation would be the last time Chapman would ever speak to Thompson, just 19 years old.

Hours later, he would learn that his fiancée, who was pregnant with the couple's first child, was hit by a train in the midst of the photoshoot.

Authorities say Thompson was standing between two sets of tracks Friday in Navasota when a BNSF Railway train approached.

Eyewitnesses told Stephenson that her daughter saw one train coming and moved out of the way. She did not realize in doing so, she moved in front of another train coming from the opposite direction.

""I'm very hurt about the situation because she was so young, but this is what she wanted. She wanted, to become a model,"" said Stephenson.

""Just getting started, planning our life,"" said Chapman.

The investigation into the accident is ongoing. Authorities will examine the onboard video from the train that hit Thompson as part of the process. Thompson's mother worries that the stilettos her daughter was wearing may have slowed her efforts to run away from the oncoming train.

Her family has set up a GoFundMe for her funeral expenses.

VELES, Macedonia – A group of migrants trying to reach European opportunity via what’s billed by smugglers as a “safe” route – trekking along train tracks through the Balkans – was hit by an overnight train in a remote river gorge in Macedonia, killing 14.

The deaths of the undocumented migrants from Africa and Asia underscore how, even as tens of thousands risk drowning in the Mediterranean to reach European shores, many others gamble with their lives by taking perilous overland journeys to reach Hungary, a popular back door to the 28-nation European Union.

Railway officials said many of those killed Thursday night stopped to rest after an exhausting hourslong hike and were sleeping on the tracks when the train plowed into them.

The overland route from Greece through Macedonia and Serbia soared in popularity over the past two years as migrants seek a less dangerous path than the sea crossing from North Africa to Italy.

Trains killed 40 migrants last year, usually in groups of one or two, compared to the more than 1,300 lives lost in the Mediterranean over the past three weeks alone – a horrifying statistic that put 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever for the sea crossing.

The Balkans smuggling route follows railway lines through most of the 125-mile hike through Macedonia, and authorities said it was only a question of time before so many trekkers would die in a single-train accident.

The rail line includes narrow wooden bridges and two long tunnels through mountains that can leave migrants trapped with no way of escape, as well as frequent riverside bends that conceal the sight and sounds of oncoming trains.

Thursday’s accident occurred around 10:30 p.m. on a narrow stretch of tracks sandwiched between the Vardar River and a steep slope. The express train from Thessaloniki, Greece, to the Serbian capital of Belgrade was about 10 miles northwest of the central Macedonian town of Veles when the train’s engineer spotted a group of about 100 migrants on the tracks in the dark, 100 yards ahead.

“At the time that the train struck the group of migrants, they were resting and sleeping on the tracks,” said Macedonian Railways manager Nikola Kostov. “The train driver honked and tried to stop, but it was too late and the train hit the group of migrants who weren’t able to leave the tracks.”

Kostov said the train was observing the local speed limit and described the stretch of track as “dangerous and unapproachable” for pedestrians.

Though Kostov did not give a precise speed, the schedule shows the train does not typically travel quickly, taking more than 14 hours to cover 400 miles, averaging just 28 mph.

Authorities said the 14 dead appeared to be mostly Somalis and Afghans in their 20s, though other details remained uncertain – not surprising, given migrants often travel without IDs to complicate deportation efforts if caught. Somalis and Afghans are among the top nationalities using the Balkans route, along with Syrians fleeing civil war in their homeland.

Police detained nine migrants who remained at the scene Friday morning and questioned them about what happened and the identities of the dead. They said survivors described clambering up rocky slopes or clinging to bushes on the riverbank to escape the train.

The Veles prosecutor, Slavica Temelkovski, said the detained migrants were mostly relatives or friends of the dead and had identified themselves and the victims as being from Somalia and Afghanistan.

Tentative plans were put in place to bury the dead Saturday at Veles’ Muslim cemetery on the presumption that, barring authentication to the contrary, all came from predominantly Muslim countries.

“This city is in disbelief,” said Veles Mayor Slavco Cadiev. He said Veles residents over the past year had grown used to seeing hundreds of migrants pass through the town at once, usually sticking close to the rail lines.

Veterans of the Balkans route have told the Associated Press that following the train tracks in Macedonia is one of the most nerve-racking parts of what can be a monthslong journey involving detentions and deportations back to Greece to start the journey over.

Smugglers usually instruct migrants to travel the tracks at night, despite the increased risk of being hit by trains, because they are less likely to be spotted by authorities in the darkness.

For many, the Balkans route starts in Turkey, where migrants pack into small boats that are often piloted by migrants themselves and abandoned once they reach the nearest Greek island. That journey, because of overcrowding and the inexperience of boat operators, is often the most dangerous part of the journey – a reality underscored this week when a wooden trawler carrying about 90 migrants broke up as it ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes, killing three on board, including a boy.

Since February, the AP followed a group of 45 West African migrants using the Balkans route. As they gathered at the Macedonian border in March, a smuggler warned they could easily be killed by a train if they didn’t break up into small groups with a spotter at the front and the back, to shout alerts to the others.

When walking at night on the tracks, migrants say, it can be hard to distinguish the wooden ties from stony gaps, never mind tell where the river is and how steep the falls might be on either side. Painful dives and tumbles into mud or gravel to avoid trains are common.

“When trains come, they don’t honk. It’s woods. There’s nobody there,” said Hamed Kouyate, an 18-year-old from Ivory Coast who completed the Balkans route this month after a two-week trek, a brief police detention and other setbacks.

Kouyate said all members of his group struggled to see in the often moonless night and many suffered injuries from falls. He said they often were slow to react to trains because of mental and physical exhaustion. At one point, he said, one woman with an injured foot had to be pushed by others out of the way of an oncoming train.

“When you’re on the tracks, you’re afraid all the time,” he said in a telephone interview from France, where he arrived this week.

The deaths of the undocumented migrants from Africa and Asia underscore how, even as tens of thousands risk drowning in the Mediterranean to reach European shores, many others gamble with their lives by taking perilous overland journeys to reach Hungary, a popular back door to the 28-nation European Union. Railway officials said many of those killed Thursday night stopped to rest after an exhausting hourslong hike and were sleeping on the tracks when the train plowed into them. The overland route from Greece through Macedonia and Serbia soared in popularity over the past two years as migrants seek a less dangerous path than the sea crossing from North Africa to Italy. Trains killed 40 migrants last year, usually in groups of one or two, compared to the more than 1,300 lives lost in the Mediterranean over the past three weeks alone – a horrifying statistic that put 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever for the sea crossing.

Jon Gregoire, a 21-year-old Liberty University senior, died Saturday, Nov. 8 around 4 p.m. after being struck by an oncoming train on a trestle behind Riverside Park in Lynchburg.

Gregoire, of Wilbraham, Massachusetts, was majoring in business administration-marketing with a certificate in Bible, according to a university news release. Gregoire also served as a prayer leader and was planning to become a missionary, the release stated. 
“Jon will be terribly missed by so many at Liberty University,” President Jerry Falwell said in a statement released Sunday evening. “He was known and loved for his adventurous spirit and his spiritual depth. … His last Facebook post on Oct. 30 reflected on how God and Jesus Christ gave life its ultimate meaning. The Gregoire family will be held up in prayer by the entire Liberty University community.”
According to Samuel Dye, an RA on floor six of the Commons Dorm where Gregoire lived, Gregoire was a godly friend and mentor who left an impact on many people in the Liberty community.  
“He was just such an encouragement to me,” Dye said. “I was his RA, but I looked up to him spiritually. He loved God so much. He loved people. … He was an incredible guy. … Anyone that knows Jon knows that he is legitimately one of the nicest people you’re ever gonna meet.” 
Dye said Gregoire showed genuine care for everyone around him and showed Christ-like love. 
“Everyone that I’ve talked to absolutely loved the guy, because he loved them, and he made that very clear through his actions, through his words,” Dye said. “… I’m never gonna forget him. I’m never gonna move on from him. I’m always gonna remember the way he loved people, the way that he just made people feel special. Every person, he made them feel important and special and loved. And that’s something that I want to emulate, because he’s emulating Christ.”
Junior Scotty Schafer, who was a member of Gregoire’s prayer group, explained Gregoire’s influence as he served on hall leadership. 
“(T)he fact that Jon spent his junior year off campus and moved back onto campus this year feeling that God wanted him to come back on campus as a prayer leader means a lot to me,” Schafer said. “I think it shows that Jon was really looking for God’s direction in his life, and he wanted to serve (God) and do what God wanted him to do. … Jon was, I think, what every prayer leader could be and should be. He was intentional. He cared about us. He loved us. He led by example.” 
In addition to serving as a prayer leader, Schafer said Gregoire always looked for ways to encourage others. 
“Jon was very outgoing,” Schafer said. “… He was very focused on … (trying) to say hello to everyone. He was good at remembering people’s names. He smiled a lot. He interacted a lot with a bunch of people in great ways, particularly with guys on the hall.”
Schafer added that seeing Gregoire’s example of love for God pushed him to strive after the Lord in the same way. 
“If I could live half of how Jon lived, I feel like I could be content. I feel like I would be serving Jesus well, ” Schafer said. “… If I loved Jesus half as much as Jon loved Jesus, I feel like I’m doing pretty good.”
Freshman Isaac Shubert III, who was also a member of Gregoire’s prayer group, affirmed that Gregoire became more than just a hall mate to the men of Floor Six. 
“Jon was a man after God’s heart,” Shubert said. “… When I (saw) him, I (thought), ‘That’s what I wanna do. That’s what I want to be.’ … He did things a brother would do, not just as a friend. He went past a friendship. He saw me as his little brother, took care of me, made sure I was OK, always checked on me, gave me inspirational phrases or inspirational words from scripture. … I respected him a whole lot.” 
The men and women who lived on Gregoire’s floor held a special worship session Sunday night, Nov. 9 to honor Jon and support one another in the grieving process. 
Gregoire’s parents flew in to participate in a candlelight vigil, which was held at 8 p.m. Monday at the front steps of DeMoss Hall. 
According to the Liberty news release, the Campus Pastors team is currently meeting with students affected by the tragedy, and counseling is available through Liberty’s Student Counseling Services. 
Victoria Bridges, a 21 year old from Newport News, Virginia, was also injured in the accident. Bridges was released from Lynchburg General Hospital by 11 a.m. Sunday after being airlifted immediately following the event, according to an article in the News & Advance. Bridges was not a Liberty student. 
Although it is unclear how many others were with Gregoire and Bridges at the time, no one else was injured. 
Saturday’s accident marks the second train-related death of a Liberty student in the past three years. In November of 2011, freshman Hannah Williams was struck and killed by a train at the same trestle.

Police said about 1:00am on Sunday a 23-year-old man was driving through bushland following a friend in another four-wheel drive when the pair attempted to cross the Adelaide to Darwin rail line near Katherine about 315 kilometres south of Darwin.

Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen said the men picked a ""non-designated crossing"" as the spot to drive over the rail line.

""One car has made it across, but the vehicle driven by the 23-year-old has become stuck on the tracks,"" Superintendent Jorgensen said.

""The men attempted to free the vehicle but were unable to do so.""

Superintendent Jorgensen said when a Darwin-bound, kilometre-long freight train carrying manganese approached, with the men shone torches and waved to try and get the attention of the driver.

The train driver attempted to slow the train but collided with the vehicle, dragging it about 500 metres under the lead locomotive, coming to rest over a rail bridge.

The two men were able to jump to safety and were uninjured.

The train driver was treated for shock and taken to Katherine Hospital for observation. He was released about 6am today.

""It's happened before, people trying to cross at non-designated crossings, which people should never do,"" Superintendent Jorgensen said.

Superintendent Jorgensen said the recovery operation could take hours, with the lead locomotive ""inoperable"".

The men, understood to be Katherine locals, are expected to face a number of charges over the incident.

""There was no alcohol involved,"" Superintendent Jorgensen said.

Train operator Genesee and Wyoming general manager Greg Pauline was at a loss to understand the two men's actions.

""I'm a bit upset about it,"" he said.

""These young idiots could have killed themselves or my crew.""

He said a goods train carrying groceries to Darwin was behind the freight train, with delays expected for several hours.

""It shouldn't affect our network too much,"" he said.

MANTECA, Calif. — A train crash killed a dog and severely injured a homeless man Sunday morning in Manteca, blocking multiple railroad crossings for a couple hours.

The man’s dog went on tracks just after 10:30 a.m. between Yosemite Avenue and Center Street, according to the Manteca Police Department. The dog’s leash reportedly got stuck on a railroad tie, the man tried to free his dog as the train approached, and they were both hit.

The dog, a white and brown pit bull mix, was killed in the crash, and the 53-year-old man survived with a severe injury to his left arm, officers said.

Crossings at Yosemite and Walnut avenues, Center Street and Union Road were blocked for a couple hours after the train came to a stop on the tracks, police said.

“It is important for the public to remember that trains coming through town cannot stop in a reasonable distance to avoid hitting persons or animals on the track,” police wrote in a news release. “For example, this train took almost a mile to come to a complete stop.”

Officers said it’s important to stay off train tracks unless traveling across at approved crossings when the arms are up.

Crossings at Yosemite and Walnut avenues, Center Street and Union Road were blocked for a couple hours after the train came to a stop on the tracks, police said. “It is important for the public to remember that trains coming through town cannot stop in a reasonable distance to avoid hitting persons or animals on the track,” police wrote in a news release. “For example, this train took almost a mile to come to a complete stop.” Officers said it’s important to stay off train tracks unless traveling across at approved crossings when the arms are up. Witnesses to this train crash, which occurred Easter morning, are urged to call Manteca police dispatch at 209-456-8101 with information; the case number is 25-01639, according to law enforcement.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Pedestrian Killed Near West Elkhorn Boulevard in Fatal Rio Linda Train Accident

A tragic Rio Linda train accident occurred on February 23, claiming the life of a pedestrian who was struck by a freight train. According to Union Pacific officials, the incident happened around 1:15 p.m., near the West Elkhorn Boulevard intersection with East Levee Road in a primarily industrial area near Straugh Road. The location lies between Rio Linda and the outskirts of North Natomas’ Village 12 neighborhood.

Fatal Rio Linda Train Accident Involved Pedestrian on the Tracks

The southbound train headed toward Sacramento struck the individual on the tracks. Emergency responders from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District pronounced the pedestrian dead at the scene. Authorities confirmed that no injuries were reported among the train crew.

Police with Union Pacific Investigating

Police with Union Pacific are currently investigating the incident. The County Coroner’s Office is expected to release the identity of the victim in the coming days.

Train Company Liability if a Pedestrian Is Killed on the Tracks

When a pedestrian is killed on the tracks, the legal responsibilities of the train company can depend on various factors, such as the circumstances of the accident, the location, and whether negligence was involved. Generally, train companies must maintain a reasonable duty of care to ensure safety in their operations. This can include adequately maintaining tracks, adhering to speed limits, sounding horns at crossings, and ensuring that crossings have the appropriate warnings and protections, such as gates and signals.

Liability in a Fatal Rio Linda Train Accident

However, the liability of the train company may be questioned if the incident occurred in an area where pedestrians are not permitted, such as private tracks or restricted railway zones. In such cases, a pedestrian unlawfully on the tracks may be seen as trespassing, which can limit the train company’s liability. Even in trespassing cases, train companies may still be partially accountable if they fail to respond appropriately after becoming aware of the danger.

The analysis of legal responsibility often hinges on proving negligence. If the train company acted recklessly or failed to take reasonable precautions that could have prevented the accident, it may be held liable. Conversely, if the pedestrian ignores warnings, signs, or barriers, which leads to a fatal Rio Linda train accident, their actions may reduce or eliminate the liability of the train company under principles like contributory or comparative negligence.

SACRAMENTO - One person has been killed by a freight train in downtown Sacramento.

According to the California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), at around 3:16 p.m., a BNSF train hit a pedestrian ""trespasser"" in the area of the P Street railroad crossing.

The victim, described as 40-50 years old, ""was observed laying on the tracks"" when they were hit, the BNSF said in a statement.

COPY LINK A Sacramento Regional Transit light-rail train collided with a maintenance train Thursday night, injuring 13 people on board, including those who were transported to area hospitals.

A light rail train collided with a car Friday afternoon on 12th Street, near Sproule Avenue, at the north entrance to downtown, according to reports. At least one injury was reported.

Sacramento Regional Transit officials said initial reports are that the car failed to stop at a red light a little before 3 p.m. RT officials said the female driver of the car was taken to a hospital as a precaution. A passenger complained of pain and was also taken to a local hospital.

The crash came less than a day after a light rail train collided with an out-of-service car near the SacRT maintenance facility in North Sacramento, injuring 13 riders.

Federal and state rail safety investigators are on scene at the site of the Thursday night crash, which took place at 9:38 p.m. Officials say they are looking to whether the crash was caused by human or mechanical error.

The crashes highlight urban transit risks.

Here is a list of some of the notable recent crashes and derailments involving the system’s trains:

Runaway driverless train

In 2015, a maintenance technician in the yard mistakenly disabled a safety feature on a train, allowing that train to take off on its own on live tracks. It traveled at speeds up to 40 miles per hour through three active light-rail stations and several street crossings on a 1.5-mile, four-minute journey before its electronic connector rod detached, causing it to glide to a halt near Del Paso Boulevard.

The technician was troubleshooting an electrical issue on the train on a spur track at the agency’s Academy Way facility. He jammed a screwdriver under the vehicle’s “deadman” switch, disabling that mechanism, officials said. He also disconnected a secondary device that would have kept the train from accelerating.

SacRT has since implemented new on-board safety measures and retrained maintenance workers.

Maintenance worker killed

In 2008, an RT maintenance worker was killed just south of the maintenance yard when he was hit by a train while lubricating the tracks. RT officials determined that inattention by both the maintenance worker and the train operator were the cause of the July fatality.

In the report, RT officials concluded employee Troy Schafer stepped onto the tracks without looking as a train approached. The train operator had sent two text messages on her cellphone, against RT policy, prior to the accident, according to phone records, the most recent about four minutes before the crash, officials said. The operator said she was not, however, on her phone when the crash occurred.

Station fatality





In 2014, Yong Sin Day, 56, was killed when she walked in front of an arriving train in the Cordova Town Center station on a rainy evening. Day, who worked nearby at a grocery, was crossing the platform with an umbrella in one hand and a plastic grocery sack in the other. Video showed that she did not appear to see the train as she crossed the station track at the closest edge to the oncoming train.

Homeless man run over by train

In 2013, Steven Lofton, 52, who was apparently homeless, tried to hurry in front of an approaching train at the Power Inn light rail station platform, but tripped and fell on the tracks. He was unable to get up in time and was pinned under the train. State PUC officials later determined the train had entered the station faster than is allowed.

30 injured in crash

On Feb. 8, 1999, 30 people were injured in midtown when an RT train carrying passengers on a single-track bridge at 19th and R streets collided head-on with a disabled train that had been allowed to bypass a red signal light, according to previous reporting in The Sacramento Bee.

At the time, RT officials blamed the crash on an error by its radio control center to determine the location of the trains and the use of multiple radio channels by operators and maintenance personnel.

‘Gate jumper’ fatality

In 2012, members of three generations of one family died when a light-rail train hit their Nissan Pathfinder broadside at 26th Avenue as the SUV darted through gates, authorities said. The 62-year-old driver was attempting to weave through the safety gates, called “gate jumping.” He died along with his daughter, 25, and 22-month-old grandson.

Just before 5:30 Tuesday evening, police and firefighters responded to the railroad crossing on Fruitridge Road just east of Power Inn Road for a reported train versus semi-truck collision.
When authorities arrived, they found a semi-truck with trailer carrying potatoes that had obviously been hit by the freight train that was stopped at the same crossing. The freight train was able to come to a stop nearby.
Fortunately, no one was hurt in the collision, as the freight train only hit the trailer portion of the semi-truck, not affecting the cab portion.
Fruitridge Road was shut down while Sacramento Police and Union Pacific Police conducted their investigation into the cause of the collision, although heavy traffic and a nearby traffic light is suspected to be a factor. Two heavy-duty tow trucks were on standby during the investigation, also trying to figure out how to remove the crushed semi-truck.

Just before 5:30 Tuesday evening, police and firefighters responded to the railroad crossing on Fruitridge Road just east of Power Inn Road for a reported train versus semi-truck collision. When authorities arrived, they found a semi-truck with trailer carrying potatoes that had obviously been hit by the freight train that was stopped at the same crossing. The freight train was able to come to a stop nearby. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the collision, as the freight train only hit the trailer portion of the semi-truck, not affecting the cab portion. Fruitridge Road was shut down while Sacramento Police and Union Pacific Police conducted their investigation into the cause of the collision, although heavy traffic and a nearby traffic light is suspected to be a factor. Two heavy-duty tow trucks were on standby during the investigation, also trying to figure out how to remove the crushed semi-truck.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Legend has it that the Pope Lick Monster terrorizes anyone who dares enter his lair below the railroad trestle in Kentucky. The beast, as he appeared in the local movie, “The Legend of the Pope Lick Monster,” supposedly terrorizes anyone who enters his domain below the imposing train trestle past Jeffersontown near Fisherville. YouTube

They had heard the legend and wanted to see it for themselves, how a half-goat, half-man named the Pope Lick Monster lives under a train trestle in Louisville, Kentucky.

So 26-year-old Roquel Bain and her boyfriend, both from Ohio, climbed onto the Norfolk Southern Railroad trestle on Saturday night, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.

Suddenly, a train came barreling towards them. The engineer told investigators he sounded the horn when he saw them on the tracks and tried to brake.

With no time to run about 40 feet to safety, Bain’s boyfriend managed to hang safely off the side of the trestle but the train hit Bain. She fell nearly 100 feet to the ground and died.

“It’s just so sad - a very pretty young girl who had her life in front of her,” deputy coroner Jack Arnold told the newspaper. “It's just so preventable.”

Bain and her boyfriend went to Louisville for a paranormal tour for ghost hunters at a local sanitorium, but decided to hunt for the monster before the 10 p.m. event.

At least three generations of local residents have grown up with the legend of the Pope Lick Monster, the star of several YouTube videos and a locally made 1988 film that Norfolk Southern criticized for putting a spotlight on the trestle.

The monster is described as a large human-like creature with alabaster skin and furry, goat-like legs and horns. He is also known as the Goatman or Sheepman.

The story goes that he was captured in the wilds of Canada around the end of the 19th century and became the star of a circus freak show. But while being transported on a train, an electrical storm caused the train to derail. The creature was the only survivor.

He is said to live under the train trestle from where he uses his supernatural, hypnotic powers to lure people onto the tracks, where they either get hit by a train or fall to their death.

WAVE 3 News in Louisville reported that many people think the train trestle is inactive, but it is very busy with trains passing regularly.

Local resident Ron Crouch told the TV station that many people come to the area to hunt the monster and put themselves in danger on the tracks.

The Courier-Journal found one Instagram photo from 2014 that showed two teens sitting on the trestle, legs dangling, proclaiming, “The Pope Lick Monster didn’t get us, but a train almost did!”

“You would think people would know better than to do that because it's a long trestle,” Crouch said. “If you get caught out in the middle you don't have time to go back.”

Coroner Arnold said he’s investigated other fatal train incidents on the trestle - including one person who jumped to their death - but Bain was the first victim claimed while searching for the monster.

A train goes through the intersection of Coloma Road and Folsom Boulevard in Rancho Cordova the day after a teen was struck and killed on the tracks.

Police officers assisted subdued students making their way to school Friday morning at tracks where a young teenager was struck and killed by a light rail train in Rancho Cordova.

The Sacramento County Coroner’s office said the teen killed when hit by the train was 15-year-old Mariah Burgess. Friends interviewed Friday at the tracks that separate the White Rock neighborhood and Folsom Boulevard said she was a freshman at Rancho Cordova High School.

The collision occurred about 2:50 p.m. at Coloma Road and Folsom Boulevard. Alane Masui, spokeswoman for Regional Transit, said witnesses reported that Burgess walked into the path of the eastbound train.

Masui said witness accounts and surveillance video indicated that warning lights were activated and the train operator sounded the horn. She said witnesses reported that the girl appeared to be using headphones and may have been distracted.

The teen was walking across tracks that run parallel to Folsom Boulevard at Coloma Road. A wall with an arched gateway allows pedestrians to walk between the White Rock residential neighborhood and businesses along Folsom Boulevard and the nearby high school and Mills Jr. High.

But first, pedestrians must cross freight tracks and two sets of light rail tracks leading from Folsom to Sacramento. Bells clang, lights flash and the sidewalk is clearly marked to alert those crossing the tracks to beware of oncoming trains.

Sacramento police officers greeted students Friday morning as they quietly made their way to school at the crossing. One boy leaned down to place a candle at the impromptu shrine erected to memorialize the death of Burgess while others spoke admiringly of the teen.

“She was just a nice person,” said 11-year-old Tatianna Franklin. “She was always encouraging, easy to talk to.”

“She had a bright future,” said 13-year-old Julianna Claypool. “She wanted to go far.”

The girls said that Burgess was sports oriented and tried out for different school teams.

Deneisha Huey walked her daughter, Jakailah Columbus, a Cordova freshman who knew Burgess, across the tracks on Friday because she was uncomfortable after the death of the teen.

“I tell my daughter to pay attention,” she said. “Watch for the red lights. Stay alert. Pay attention to your surroundings.”

One woman who lives nearby, Linda Elizondo, said that it would be good to have a crossing guard at the site.

A mother’s cries in the darkness couldn’t drown out the haunting sound of the Regional Transit warning bells that should have alerted her daughter a deadly threat was near.

“I hate them for hitting my baby,” Amanda Burgess said through tears as she talked about her 15-year-old daughter, Mariah.

More than one hundred people gathered in Rancho Cordova to hold up a bright light for the even brighter one they say was snuffed out during a walk home from Cordova High School.

One of seven children, Mariah, was walking with her twin Myia and their other siblings when she was hit at Folsom Boulevard and Coloma Road by a light rail train servicing the Gold Line.

“We just saw her. We were just talking with her,” said Angela Byron, the mother of one of Mariah’s friends from school.

Regional Transit investigators say the train operator hit the brakes but wasn’t able to stop before impact.

They tell FOX40 video surveillance in the area shows Mariah walking into the path of that train despite the blaring horn sounded by the operator.

There are reports she was wearing earbuds or earmuffs.

With hearts so broken and emotions running so high, it’s not a scenario sitting well with her family,

“I want to see the tape RT. I want to see the tape, want to see proof why she’s dead right now. He hit her so hard they severed my daughter out here on the tracks. They severed her,” Mariah’s father Dwayne Burgess cried to the crowd.

Their need to be where Mariah left them, left the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department and RT warning her loved ones that remembrance wasn’t worth the risk of another life.

A helicopter blasted down voice encouragements for the mourners to move off the tracks.

As for Mariah, everyone at the memorial is convinced they know where that life, that light has gone.

The faithful teen was just asking all about heaven in bible study on Tuesday.

“God you do not make mistakes and you use everything to show your glory. We’re asking Father God for you to show your glory in this situation,” prayed her pastor Raymond Bradley.

Regional Transit procedure following an incident like this is to have the operator undergo alcohol and drug tests and for them to be placed on administrative leave.

Video of the accident was recorded from inside the train and will be reviewed as part of the investigation.

White County sheriff Pat Shafer said 14 people complaining of pain were taken to local hospitals after the collision. The truck driver was not among the injured, he said.

Shafer said the collision occurred about 8.20am when the northbound train struck a semi-truck that had crossed onto rail tracks running adjacent to US 421. He said the train split the truck in half but its driver was not injured. He said it’s unclear why the truck was on the rural tracks about 25 miles north of Lafayette.

“The collision ripped the truck in half,” Shafer told the Associated Press.

Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said none of the passengers and crew injured in Tuesday morning’s collision involving the Hoosier State line suffered serious or life-threatening injuries.

Magliari said the collision occurred shortly after the train left Lafayette, where it had made it second stop to pick up passengers after leaving Indianapolis. He said the train was carrying 56 passengers and three crew members when it collided with the semi-truck.

Magliari said it’s unclear why the truck’s driver apparently disregarded train crossing signs at the marked public train crossing along a White County road that intersects with US 421.

Shafer said the train’s uninjured passengers were taken from the scene on buses.

Mickayla Friend, 16, of Marysville, Calif., was on the way to a Sadie Hawkins Day dance with her boyfriend, whose identity authorities have not released, when the couple took a detour along some train tracks to pick up food before the event, KCRA Sacramento reports.
Authorities say the couple were walking south along the tracks when a train approached behind them. The conductor sounded a warning horn and engaged emergency brakes but not in time.
“The engineer was on the horn,” said Sean Stark, who witnessed the incident. “Then finally, they both looked back at the same time.” Friend’s male companion died after being struck by the train.
“They would have both been underneath that train if he didn’t push her out of the way at the last second,” Stark said.
Union Pacific Railroad and the Marysville Police Department are investigating the incident.

The teen was conscious and talking when he was transported to the hospital with ""severe injuries,"" Hunt said. Gunther died later Friday night, Galt police said. 

Galt High School Principal Maria Orr issued a statement Saturday about Gunther's death. She noted that the school will have counselors available Monday for students and staff. 

""As a small school in a close knit community, we are in shock and devastated by the loss of our student."" Orr wrote. ""Kyle was a member of our JV football team. His teammates are most affected by his passing. 

""Our hearts go out to Kyle's friends and family,"" she wrote. 

The train conductor sounded the horn as a warning before the teen was hit. Hunt said the conductor and the train engineer are being interviewed by Union Pacific.

Guenther died when he was struck by a train last weekend.


GALT - An anti-bullying rally was held at Galt High School Wednesday morning, four days after a freshman student was killed by a train. 

But 14-year-old Kyle Guenther wasn't a bully, he was one of the kids fighting against them. 

""One of the students actually said that Kyle had come to her rescue when she was being bullied in elementary school.  And she never forgot that,"" Galt High Principal Maria Orr said. 

The rally was led by Travis Brown, aka Mr. Mojo, who is best known for his anti-bullying work on MTV's ""Made"". 

Mojo travels across the country telling kids that bullying stems from two things: normal and different. He said bullies put ""normal"" people in one category, or box. 

""And if somebody doesn't fit into that box, then we start talking about them, tagging them, treating them as if it's wrong, weird or unacceptable,"" Mojo told the assembly of freshmen and sophomores. 

He also said, ""As long as you're going to fight hate with hate, you're going to get more hate. Somebody said an eye for an eye makes us all blind.  You have to think about how you're going to handle these situations that happen."" 

Mojo was quick to point out, though, that, ""Everything that we teach is always easier said than done. But that's why it has to be a village approach.""  

The ""villagers"" appeared to hear him. 

After the assembly, freshman Kaitlyn Victor said she was ready to tell her story about a group of girls tormenting her, in person and online, for a year and a half. 

The name they were calling her isn't appropriate to repeat. 

""She [the leader of the group] would bully me outside of school, inside of school, every way that she could,"" Kaitlyn said. 

""I was planning to stab myself.  Another time I was planning to take a bunch of pills. But my best friend text me right before. I don't remember what she said, but having that text was enough to know that someone was there for me and I could get through this."" 

Orr said for the first time since Kyle's death, students are smiling again.  

""The students have said, 'What would Kyle do? How would Kyle want us to move forward?' They want to honor Kyle's memory by doing the right thing,"" Orr said. 

Mojo added, ""See, the truth is, today was a 45-minute band-aid.  What happens tomorrow is the cure.""

- Share via
A pedestrian died Saturday night after being struck by a Metrolink train between the Lancaster and Palmdale stations.
About 70 passengers were stranded on the train for more than 90 minutes during the initial phase of the investigation, and travel on the rail route between Lancaster and Union Station in downtown Los Angeles continued to be disrupted well into the evening, said Chris Gutierrez, a spokesman for Metrolink.
The accident happened at 6:22 p.m., about 11 minutes after the scheduled departure of Train 1282 from the Palmdale station, with arrival at Union Station scheduled for 8:20 p.m.
The incident did not occur at a crossing — so it was in an area where a pedestrian should not have been approaching the tracks, said Gutierrez, who could not immediately provide a more specific location.
The train stopped after the collision and first responders were summoned, but the victim was dead at the scene.
Passengers were kept on the train while an evaluation was made of whether the terrain allowed for a safe evacuation. The initial decision was to hold them on board, but by 8 p.m., officials decided passengers could disembark.
Metrolink provided passengers a $50 rideshare voucher to help them get to their destinations.
The train had to remain in place longer.
“Essentially the train is now part of an investigation,” Gutierrez said, “which is why we can’t move it until they complete their investigation.”
In that area, the line is a single track, preventing the passage of trains in either direction. Within the first two hours of the fatal collision, four other trains had been affected.
Early in the evening, Metrolink was evaluating whether and when service could be resumed on part of the route.
Ticketed passengers on other affected trains also are being offered rideshare vouchers.
Metrolink is providing updates about the status of the service on its website and its X social media account:
Lancaster police are investigating the incident.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

An 11-year-old girl was killed and her mother was left critically injured after being struck by a train in Redlands on Tuesday night.

The fatal collision happened on the railroad tracks at Alabama Street, just north of Redlands Boulevard shortly before 8:30 p.m., according to the Redlands Police Department.

The Metrolink train was traveling at about 50 mph when the engineer spotted the victims’ vehicle on the train tracks, police said. The engineer applied the brakes but was unable to stop in time before crashing head-on into the victims’ car.

The child was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. The mother, who was sitting in the driver’s seat, was taken to the hospital with critical injuries.

Images from the scene show the victims’ car completely mangled and destroyed at the busy intersection. Debris from the crash was strewn across the tracks and nearby roadway.

The victims were headed northbound when they ended up on the tracks for some unknown reason, police said. Moments later, a Metrolink train traveling westbound struck the vehicle.

There were four people aboard the train at the time — two passengers, an engineer and the conductor, said Metrolink. One passenger was taken to the hospital with a “complaint of pain,” officials said.

Locals say the intersection where the crash took place is a dangerous one.

“It’s very busy and there are often people who don’t stop when they’re supposed to at the intersection,” said Nicolas, who commutes to Redlands for work. “They stop in the middle of the intersection because there’s just so many cars lined up, so I can see an accident happening pretty easily.”

“We just heard a loud bang,” said Saalim Scott, a man who worked nearby and heard the crash. “I thought it was something falling off the truck. We all came out and we saw the car and somebody off to the side. It’s just pretty sad, honestly, because life is short. You want to hold your family a little closer.”

“I got in my car and I came right here and that’s when I realized the car was hit by the train,” said resident Victor Medford. “It hurts. It hurts bad. Last night when I saw it, I cried.”

Police are still investigating how the vehicle ended up on the tracks in the first place.

“The initial investigation indicated that all safety gates and signals were working properly and there were no signs of drugs or alcohol in the driver’s system,” police said.

The crash happened in a quiet zone where train horns do not sound off at crossings unless it’s an emergency situation. It’s unclear whether the Metrolink train’s horn went off before the deadly collision.

The mother remains hospitalized in critical condition. No identities have been released by authorities.

The victims were headed northbound when they ended up on the tracks for some unknown reason, police said. Moments later, a Metrolink train traveling westbound struck the vehicle. There were four people aboard the train at the time — two passengers, an engineer and the conductor, said Metrolink. One passenger was taken to the hospital with a “complaint of pain,” officials said. Locals say the intersection where the crash took place is a dangerous one. “It’s very busy and there are often people who don’t stop when they’re supposed to at the intersection,” said Nicolas, who commutes to Redlands for work. “They stop in the middle of the intersection because there’s just so many cars lined up, so I can see an accident happening pretty easily.” “We just heard a loud bang,” said Saalim Scott, a man who worked nearby and heard the crash. “I thought it was something falling off the truck. We all came out and we saw the car and somebody off to the side. It’s just pretty sad, honestly, because life is short. You want to hold your family a little closer.” “I got in my car and I came right here and that’s when I realized the car was hit by the train,” said resident Victor Medford. “It hurts. It hurts bad. Last night when I saw it, I cried.” Police are still investigating how the vehicle ended up on the tracks in the first place",,,

Two people are in critical condition after crashing into a Metrolink train in San Bernardino on Wednesday.

The collision happened on Rancho Avenue as the victims drove their pickup truck across the railroad tracks, according to the San Bernardino Police Department.

Over 30 passengers were aboard the train during the crash, police said.

Images from the scene show the crash left the truck in a mangled mess, sending debris strewn across the railroad.

Officers say the truck driver was traveling eastbound towards the tracks at an “unsafe speed.”

Several videos have gone viral in recent months that show impatient pedestrians climbing on and under trains to get from Harbor Drive to the Gaslamp.

A few months ago, another victim lost her leg at 5th and Harbor while trying to crawl between rail cars.

""These freight trains come through the area,"" SDPD Lt. Anthony Reese said. ""They periodically just stop and pedestrians get a little frustrated not being able to cross because you can't cross while the trains are there stopped, so they take it [upon] themselves just to cross, and, unfortunately, some of them don't make it before the train starts, and they get stuck or they fall and, you know, they succumb to these injuries.""

Police are urging people to obey the flashing lights and wait for the train to pass, or to use the pedestrian bridge.

The victim from this latest incident was rushed to the UC San Diego Medical Center. It's not known if surgeons were able to reattach the limb.

The DOT urges pedestrians to “always expect a train” when near tracks, as they don’t always follow a set schedule, don’t always sound warning horns when approaching a crossing and can take upwards of a mile to come to a complete stop.

“Even when you are not standing directly on the tracks, you risk being hit by a train by being on railroad property,” the DOT says.

The identity of the person killed has not been released.

At least one person was struck and injured in downtown San Diego Monday night when a group of people tried to cross the tracks.

According to police, a group of people became impatient after a train was sitting on the tracks and blocking access to 5th Avenue across the street from the Convention Center and decided to climb over and under the train.

“The trolley arms were down, it was a slow moving train and people… didn’t want to wait for the train,” San Diego police Lt. Anthony Reese told Onscene.Media.

The engineer had no idea that the BNS&F train had struck anybody and thus did not stop, he said. First responders found one person on the tracks.

On Tuesday, people who work downtown told ABC 10News that they regularly see the freight trains blocking intersections and crosswalks.

They say people get impatient and start crawling through the train cars or going around them.

""I see people running through that all the time, I see people going around, so if the train is almost to the end to go around it, they'll go around it, I see. People jumping through sometimes, on bikes sometimes like quickly going around it,"" said Rhiawna Samudio, who works nearby.

Pedicab drivers in the area say they see the same issue with people climbing on and through the trains when they're stationary.

""It takes about 20 to 25 minutes, sometimes even longer, so people get desperate, and they start crossing the train,"" said Maycl Soto, a pedicab driver who regularly works downtown.

The fatal incident occurred last Friday when Segal, on a bicycle, crossed the train tracks and was struck by an oncoming train.

“After the northbound train passed through, a 17-year-old boy crossed the tracks on his bike, not realizing there was also a passing southbound train,” the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said.

The two other teens were not hurt.

Alex attended Torrey Pines High School and according to the school's website, was a member of the boy's junior varsity soccer team.

In an email to Torrey Pines families, principal Rob Coppo said:

“I know we are all deeply saddened by this loss, and we send our condolences to the student’s family and friends.

The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was crossing the railroad tracks on Sorrento Valley Blvd, between Sorrento Valley Road and Roselle Street, when he was hit by the southbound Amtrak Pacific Surfliner at 12:34 pm.
He died at the scene.
The victim was one of three boys who stopped their bikes at the railroad crossing gates to wait for a northbound train to pass. But as so often happens, he rode around the gates after that train had passed, not realizing another train was coming in the opposite direction.
Tragically, Fox5 reports that the victim’s parents arrived shortly after the crash, while officials were still removing his mangled bike from the tracks.
The other two boys were not injured. It’s not clear if they were riding with the victim, or just happened to stop together at the gates.
This is yet another tragic reminder to always wait until the gates go up to cross any rail tracks, regardless of whether it seems safe at the time.
Anyone with information is urged to call the Sheriff’s Department’s non-emergency line at 858/565-5200.
This is at least the 24th bicycling fatality in Southern California this year, and the seventh that I’m aware of in San Diego County.
Update: The victim has been identified 17-year old Alex Segal. He was a student at Torrey Pines High School in the Del Mar Heights neighborhood, and a member of the junior varsity soccer team.
My deepest sympathy and prayers for Alex Segal and all his family and loved ones.
Thanks to Phillip Young for the heads-up.

Fresno, CA (May 27, 2020)– A train accident was reported Friday on Fruit and Ashlan Avenues that left Ashley Sanchez dead.
 
Police officers responded to the scene on May 22 on Fruit and Ashlan Avenues around 11:30 p.m. On the scene, the responding officials found the body of a 19-year-old woman, Ashley Sanchez.
 
Based on the investigation, the conductor said that things seemed so sudden. The train did not have enough time and was unable to stop before hitting Ashley Sanchez.
 
Due to the lack of details, it is still unknown why Sanchez was near the tracks. The investigation is still on-going.
 
Furthermore, the surrounding area on Fruit and Ashlan Avenues have since reopened. 

We at Sweet Lawyers offer our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Ashley Sanchez. Our deepest thoughts are with them during this difficult time.

 
Pending Investigation of Fatal Train Accident on Fruit and Ashlan Avenues
 
In the case of Ashley Sanchez, it is crucial that the family of the victim become aware of their rights under the law.  This means that there may be a right to file a lawsuit against the person, or person’s company responsible for the loss of their loved one. Those closest to the victim may have the right to seek compensation for their loss; some common examples include funeral expenses, medical bills, and what is called “loss of consortium.” Loss of consortium generally means the deprivation of future affection and companionship over an untimely death.

(KGTV) — A woman was hit and killed by a trolley car in Lemon Grove Wednesday.

The woman was hit by a San Diego MTS trolley at about 3:45 p.m. near the Lemon Grove Avenue and Massachusetts Ave. stop, according to the San Diego Sheriff's Department. Deputies say the woman was dragged by the trolley and later died.

The cause of the deadly crash was under investigation.

The MTS Orange Line was closed between the Encanto/62nd and Spring Street Stations due to the police investigation. Buses will be used between the two stations to bridge travelers to their next stop during the closure, MTS tweeted.

SAN DIEGO, Texas — In the tight-knit town of San Diego, Texas, it's not out of the ordinary for the train to pass through late at night.

A portion of the track runs through the front and back yards of some residents' homes, especially those living near North Bexar Street.

""I heard a big bang, screeching noise, I thought the train was going to fall on my house,"" Madelynn De La Rosa said describing what happened Thursday night.

After their houses rattled, neighbors rushed to the scene which they described as chaotic and heartbreaking -- a car was trapped under the train, with a man inside.

""He was just screaming in there and I couldn't do anything,"" De La Rosa said.

As neighbors gathered around the car, so did first responders. One neighbor, who requested to be anonymous, said their worst fears were confirmed when police approached the trapped car.

""As soon as we heard his name, we knew, and our hearts dropped because he grew up here with us,"" she said.

Neighbors said it was 26-year-old Eric Galvan who was yelling and honking his horn to let people know he was alive.

""They tried like, talking to him too, and like being there for him and everything,"" De La Rosa said.

Neighbors believe Galvan's vehicle crashed with the train at a railroad crossing a block away, and was then dragged by the train until coming to a stop.

First responders said they faced challenges as they tried to remove Galvan. One, train cars are not easy to lift and move; and two, there were live power lines strewn all over the scene.

Bystanders tried to comfort Galvan as they worked to remove his car.

""It was amazing to see like, how all our neighbors got together and try to help this man,"" San Diego resident Emeree Rodriguez said.

Unfortunately, Galvan passed away at the scene. Bystanders said his family was nearby as the events unfolded.

""My thoughts are with them and I can't even imagine what they're going through,"" one witness said.

According to neighbors, Galvan had a significant other and a child. They said as they get through this tough time, they'll come together as a small but strong community to support Galvan's family.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Bexar,TX,48,San Diego,North Bexar Street,A,Car,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,26,1,Male,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Eric Galvan,1,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,No,No,"In the tight-knit town of San Diego, Texas, it's not out of the ordinary for the train to pass through late at night.

A man walking on train tracks in Carlsbad was struck and killed Wednesday evening by a Coaster Train.

Deputies responded about 6 p.m. to a report of a pedestrian collision involving a Coaster Train on the tracks just south of Tamarack Avenue, according to Deputy M. Levine of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.

The train was traveling at approximately 75 miles per hour when the man was observed walking on the tracks, Levine said. The man was struck by the train and pronounced dead at the scene.

The name of the victim was not immediately released.

Anyone who may have witnessed this incident was asked to call the sheriff’s department at (858) 565-5200.

Two Moorpark men were hit and killed days apart on the same stretch of railroad track near Avenida Colonia and Nogales Avenue.
Both men were struck by Amtrak trains traveling at approximately 70 miles per hour, officials from the Ventura County
Sheriff’s Office said, and both were pronounced dead at the scene.
Authorities do not know why 38-year-old Robert “Bobby” Melgoza was near the railroad tracks when he was hit and killed Nov. 24.
The second man, 47-year-old Jesse Zepeda, was reportedly laying flowers for Melgoza when he was struck at the same spot Nov. 26.
The first fatality occurred just before 5 p.m. last Saturday when a nine-car passenger train traveling from San Diego to San Luis Obispo struck Melgoza on the railroad tracks south of Avenida Colonia, according to authorities.
Zepeda, the victim of the second crash—which happened at 11:33 a.m. Monday on the same stretch of roadway—was placing flowers for the Melgoza, according to witnesses.
Melgoza Courtesy of Anthony Martinez
“Witnesses advised the adult male tried to step off the tracks before the train came through but did not get off the tracks in time,” according to a report from the sheriff’s office.
Zepeda was struck by the 10-car passenger train traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle.
No passengers or crew members on either Amtrak train was injured. The first train reportedly had 413 passengers and seven crew members on board; the second train had 226 passengers and three crew members.
Each fatal crash shut down the railroad tracks in both directions for more than two hours.
Both fatalities remain under investigation.
Family and friends of Melgoza started a GoFundMe page, gofundme.com/robertmelgozamemorial, to help pay for the Moorpark resident’s funeral expenses.
According to the online fundraiser, Melgoza was a “loving son, brother, friend and, most importantly, a father.”
“He was one of a kind and the definition of true strength,” the GoFundMe page reads.
Railroad deaths
Although trespassing on railroad property is illegal in nearly every state, it remains the leading cause of death on or near rail lines.
According to a 2016 report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS), a public policy research arm of the U.S. Congress, trespassing results in more train-related fatalities than derailments and collisions combined.
Of the 9,575 railroad incidents in the United States in 2017, 824 resulted in fatalities, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration. About 19 percent, or 157, of those fatalities were reported in California.
Nearly all were the result of people trespassing on railroad property, including freight, commuter and intercity passenger lines.
“Most pedestrian trespassers are simply taking a shortcut along rail tracks, although some are on the tracks for recreational purposes,” John Frittelli, a specialist in transportation policy, wrote in his 2016 CRS report. “The public may have the misperception that they will be able to hear a train coming in time to avoid it.”
Some may be distracted because they are wearing headphones or looking at their cellphones; others are impaired by alcohol or drugs, according to the report.
Since 2005, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Rail Authority have worked together to reduce the number of rail accidents caused by human error and equipment malfunction.
The organizations manage the National Rail Safety Action Plan, a blueprint to address safety issues facing the railroad industry.
The action plan works to address worker fatigue, improve track safety, enhance emergency preparedness, strengthen the safety compliance program and improve rail crossing safety.
In addition to their action plan, the industry has devoted time and resources to educating the public about the risk of driving and walking near rail tracks.
This education is done mainly through Operation LifeSaver, a nonprofit that works to reduce fatal train accidents and educate people about railroad rights-ofway and crossing safety.
Active in every state, Operation LifeSaver brings in rail professionals to speak to school groups, driver education classes, professional drivers, law enforcement officers and emergency responders.
The group also tries to prevent rail deaths by fining those who are caught trespassing and by placing warning signs and fences near populated areas.
In 2015, safety improvements were made at four railroad crossings in Simi Valley and Moorpark to reduce the number of train-related accidents in the cities.
The project added crossing gates on busy roadways to ensure cars and pedestrians do not cross in front of an oncoming train.
The gates were added at First Street, Erringer Road and Sycamore Drive in Simi Valley and at Moorpark Avenue in Moorpark.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,11,26,2018,11,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Ventura,CA,06,Moorpark,Avenida Colonia and Nogales Avenue,K,Pedestrian,70,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,passenger train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Day,Unknown,Unknown,2,Passenger Train,1,Unknown,Unknown,9,9,70,E,2,South,1,Gates,Unknown,A,Dry,1,Both sides,1,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,2,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,7,Unknown,2,Unknown,2,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,0,639,Yes,Unknown,413 and 226,Unknown,Unknown,"Two Moorpark men were hit and killed days apart on the same stretch of railroad track near Avenida Colonia and Nogales Avenue.

An Amtrak train struck and killed a pedestrian on tracks just north of Oceanside late Sunday morning.

It happened shortly before 10:30 a.m. north of Oceanside Harbor Drive on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, according to Oceanside Police, who were the first to respond to the crash but turned the incident over to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.

Sheriff’s deputies were not immediately able to provide identifying information on the victim.

Amtrak Pacific Surfliner tweeted soon after the crash that tracks were shut down in the area while law enforcement investigated the death, and to expect lengthy delays to affect at least six trains between Los Angeles and San Diego.

About an hour and a half later, around noon, Pacific Surfliner tweeted that tracks were being reopened but delays were expected to continue while service returned to normal.

DEL MAR (CBS 8/CNS) - A southbound Coaster commuter train hit a vehicle Saturday afternoon in Del Mar, causing serious injuries to one victim who was hospitalized, according to officials.

 

An SUV containing two people in the area where 15th Street crosses the tracks was hit, according to San Diego County sheriff's officials.

 

A woman driving an SUV was attempting to make a U-turn at the train crossing near Coast Boulevard when the crossing arm came down. When she tried to turn around, she got clipped by the train and hit a pedestrian, trapping the victim under the vehicle, according to San Diego County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Schaller.

The pedestrian suffered major injuries and was transported to Scripps La Jolla for evaluation.

About seven deputies responded to the tracks where the Coaster train came to a stop in the area near Ocean Avenue just before 2:30 p.m., Schaller

said.

 

There were apparently two witnesses to the collision, and deputies requested a Farsi translator to respond to the scene, Schaller said.

The accident was reported just after 9:30 a.m. at Pacific Highway and Washington Street in the uptown San Diego area. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department told NBC 7 no injuries were reported.

Traffic was shut down and diverted in the area, officials said. Amtrak service was temporarily shut down in both directions as well.

Officers from the San Diego Police Department, San Diego Fire-Rescue Department (SDFD) crews and officials from the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) all responded to the scene.

The collision caused the box truck to also smash into a fence that runs along the train tracks. The box truck plowed through a cross pole and traffic sign, which wound up wedged between the truck and fence. The truck subsequently struck three other vehicles.

The traffic sign also hit an MTS vehicle parked on the other side of the fence, damaging a window.

NBC 7 spoke with Natalie Fernbaugh, a passenger on the Amtrak train bound for Los Angeles.

She said she was listening to music when, suddenly, the train came to a halt.

“It stopped really abruptly. We were just all kind of confused,” she explained. ""It kind of shook.""

Fernbaugh said she and other passengers waited in their seats for 15 minutes or so, until they heard an announcement on the speaker from Amtrak staff. They were notified of the accident, and the subsequent delay of their train trip.

Witness Jasmine Pablo was riding in a car with a friend near the tracks, waiting at a red light behind a line of other cars.

Now, however, Metrolink is trying to determine whether a design flaw in one of the state-of-the-art cars played a role in derailing the train.

The evaluation marks a setback in the regional passenger railroad’s campaign to employ advanced safety technology to help rebuild public confidence after a 2008 head-on collision in Chatsworth killed 28 and injured 135.

On Thursday, railroad officials announced that they will restrict the use of 57 of the new passenger cars that have control cabs for engineers and operate at the front of trains when they are being pushed from behind by locomotives.

The use of such “cab cars” is common practice among the nation’s commuter railroads when trains reverse direction at the end of a line.

While the railroad, which serves six Southern California counties, reexamines safety features on the cars, built by South Korea-based Hyundai Rotem Co., the vehicles will be replaced with locomotives leased from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Co. The cab cars will remain in service as passenger coaches used elsewhere in a train’s lineup of cars.

“We are taking this additional step as a redundancy to keep our riders safe,” said Metrolink Chief Executive Art Leahy. He added that the railroad is dedicated to becoming the safest in the nation.

Hyundai Rotem officials could not be reached for comment.

In February, a Metrolink train with a Rotem cab car in front derailed after hitting a pickup truck and trailer that strayed into a grade crossing at 5th Street and Rice Avenue outside of Oxnard.

Metrolink officials declared that the new cars with energy-absorbing crush zones, heavier construction and anti-derailing features helped reduce deaths and injuries. The agency’s $263-million investment in Rotem passenger and cab cars clearly paid off, they argued.

As part of its investigation, the railroad is trying

to determine whether a plow-like attachment on the front of the cab car failed in the collision and allowed wreckage to get under the wheels, triggering the derailment.

“We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution,” said Moorpark City Councilman Keith Millhouse, a member of the railroad’s board of directors. “This is an interim measure until the plow can be evaluated and beefed up if necessary. This is going to be costly for the railroad, but you can’t put a price on safety.”

Millhouse estimated that use of the cab cars will be restricted for a year before the issue is resolved.

Leahy said the railroad has been working with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Oxnard accident. Though there are concerns about the Rotem cab car plows, the NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the crash.

“This is very interesting,” said Paul Dyson, president of the Rail Passenger of Assn. of California who has questioned whether the new Rotem cars are as safe as officials say. “The plow is critical in keeping debris out from under the cars. Something was really wrong in Oxnard with the way the train jack-knifed. Passengers really got tossed around.”

Dyson contends that the cars’ energy-absorbing crush zones did not appear to lessen the force of the impact and that the couplers between cars did not keep coaches aligned as intended.

Since 2003, Metrolink has had four serious accidents, including three derailments, involving trains with cab cars in front. Sixteen people were killed and almost 360 injured in those crashes.

Though federal studies indicate there is minimal risk from the use of cab cars, some safety experts contend that having heavier locomotives in front reduces chances of derailment in an accident. They also have questioned Metrolink’s use of cab cars in a 512-mile system that contains hundreds of grade crossings and shares track with freight trains.

Tim Smith, the California legislative director for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, declined to comment on the Oxnard crash. In general, he said the union opposes the use of cab cars.

“We have felt they are dangerous,” Smith said. “Cab cars are light in weight and easy to lift off the tracks. As far as safety is concerned, we would like to have a locomotive out in front.”

Millhouse, however, defended the use of cab cars and said the new Rotem designs are superior to previous generations of such control cars.

Officials have praised the cars, saying that they include the latest safety features required by the federal government and that Metrolink is at the forefront of deploying the new technology.

Millhouse stressed that the temporary restrictions on the Rotem vehicles relate specifically to how the plow performed in the crash, not the larger debate over the safety of cab cars.

The man, who was between 20 and 30 years old, was cut into pieces by the northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train, which was travelling about 10mph (16km/h) at the time and was 62 cars long, Detective Ed Macken from San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said.

“He was be-bopping back and forth and there might have been phones up recording,” Macken said. “He was trying to do a manoeuvre to shoot under a train and it didn’t work.”

The train finally came to a stop about 35 miles (56km) north of the fatal incident.

Macken said the crossing gates were down and warning lights were flashing when the accident happened.

The death highlighted an ongoing problem with open, very visible and accessible train corridors in San Diego County, Macken said.

“We’ve had 22 train suicides and accidents in the last year-and-a-half,” he said. “We don’t think this one was a suicide, but they all make a big mess.”

Passenger and freight trains in both directions were stopped for hours while deputies tried to gather evidence and find witnesses.

“We’re still looking for witnesses,” Macken said. “What we know was he was crouched down, bobbing back and forth and then he went for it.

The death highlighted an ongoing problem with open, very visible and accessible train corridors in San Diego County, Macken said. “We’ve had 22 train suicides and accidents in the last year-and-a-half,” he said. “We don’t think this one was a suicide, but they all make a big mess.” Passenger and freight trains in both directions were stopped for hours while deputies tried to gather evidence and find witnesses. “We’re still looking for witnesses,” Macken said. “What we know was he was crouched down, bobbing back and forth and then he went for it. Sixty train cars went by and then he rolled under the last two.”",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

The city council, led by current Del Mar Mayor Lee Haydu, has declared Jan. 21, 2014, “Remembering Lou Terrell Day” in the City of Del Mar.



“Lou was a natural leader who set an example for all of us on how to make Del Mar a better place,” reads a proclamation from the council honoring Terrell. “His tremendous positive impact in this community will be significantly missed by all our residents.”



Terrell was fatally hit by an oncoming train on Jan. 3 near the train tracks in the 100-block of 11th Street, a popular crossing spot in Del Mar for surfers and pedestrians. He was taking part in one of his favorite daily activities, walking his dog, Abe, during the deadly accident.

According to investigators, Terrell was walking his unleashed dog when a northbound Amtrak train approached the area and sounded its horn. Officials believe the horn spooked the dog, which darted across the tracks with Terrell running after it. The train hit Terrell, killing him on impact.



The dog survived and was reunited with Terrell’s loved ones following the tragic accident.



Friends, family and the Del Mar City Council say Terrell loved body-surfing and would constantly catch waves at the local beach. The avid dog lover would also take daily walks around town, greeting fellow dog owners with a smile and conversation.



According to the city council, Terrell was an active member of the Del Mar community for more than 40 years. He was first appointed to a city committee on Jan. 2, 1979, serving as a member of the Beach Encroachment Committee. On Apr. 8, 1980, Terrell was elected to the city council, a position he held from 1980 to 1984.



On Apr. 20, 1981, the city council unanimously appointed Terrell as the mayor of Del Mar.



“Lou was an active participant in citizen meetings to develop the community plan and contributed significantly to our city by being the founder and early president of the Del Mar Foundation to help develop a diverse cultural arts program in the city, an endowment for the city and originating the summer concerts in the park, booking top performers to entertain citizens from all over the region,” cites Tuesday’s proclamation.



In addition to those duties, Terrell also represented Del Mar on SANDAG in 1980, served as President of Planned Parenthood of San Diego & Riverside Counties, served as a board member of the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties, served as a board member and president of the Foundation for Change and was Chair of the Political Science Department at San Diego State University.



A memorial was held for Terrell on Jan. 5 at the Powerhouse Community Center. There, loved ones, friends and residents remembered the countless hours Terrell dedicated to Del Mar during his lifetime and said his death was a huge loss for the community.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,3,2014,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,San Diego,CA,06,Del Mar,Unknown,K,Pedestrian,Unknown,North,3,Moving over crossing,1,Carr(s) (moving),Public,A,Train pulling – RCL,2,Rail equipment struck by highway user,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Amtrak,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,North,6,Audible,Unknown,A,Dry,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,3,Unknown,1,Male,2,No,4,Stopped on crossing,3,Unknown,7,Unknown,2,Unknown,1,0,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,No,Unknown,Unknown,No,No,"Louis “Lou” Terrell was fatally hit by an oncoming train on Jan. 3 near the train tracks in the 100-block of 11th Street, a popular crossing spot in Del Mar for surfers and pedestrians.

ENCINITAS (CNS) - Authorities Sunday publicly identified the tow truck driver who was struck and killed by an Amtrak train at a railroad crossing in Cardiff-by-the-Sea.

Shaun William Riddle, 27, was attempting to hook a vehicle stalled at Chesterfield Drive and South Coast Highway 101 to the flatbed tow truck about 2:35 p.m. Saturday, according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office.

Riddle was apparently assisting the owner of a broken-down SUV just west of the tracks, sheriff's officials said.

A southbound Surfliner train approached the intersection and Riddle got back into the truck to move it out of the train's path, but could not do so, the Medical Examiner's Office reported.

The train was traveling at a high rate of speed when it struck the tow truck, which reportedly was between closed crossing arms, authorities said. The rig was demolished.

Riddle died at the scene, the Medical Examiner's Office said.

The southbound train stopped at the Solana Beach station, where several of the 125 passengers aboard were treated for minor injuries. Passengers were transferred to another train or buses, and the tracks were reopened shortly before 5 p.m.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,6,25,2023,2,PM,Solana Beach,Unknown,San Diego,CA,06,Cardiff-by-the-Sea,South Coast Highway 101,C,Tow truck,Unknown,2,1,Unknown,1,Amtrak train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Passenger Train-Pulling,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,South,1,Gates,Unknown,A,Dry,1,Both sides,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,1,27,1,Male,2,Unknown,3,Unknown,2,Unknown,7,Unknown,1,Yes,1,0,125,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,125,Yes,Unknown,125,Unknown,Unknown,"Shaun William Riddle, 27, was attempting to hook a vehicle stalled at Chesterfield Drive and South Coast Highway 101 to the flatbed tow truck about 2:35 p.m. Saturday, according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office.

 The crash happened around 2:35 p.m. at Chesterfield Drive and South Coast Highway 101.

 

 According to Encinitas deputies, the driver of the tow truck had stopped on the railroad tracks to assist a disabled SUV that was stalled just west of the tracks.

 

 A short time later, an Amtrak train approached. The tow truck was unable to move in time and was struck by the train. 

 

 The driver of the tow truck sustained fatal injuries and died at the scene, deputies said.

 

 The crash is under investigation

 

 At 3:35 p.m., North County Transit took to their Twitter page to also confirm the collision, tweeting: ""Due to an incident on the tracks involving Amtrak, COASTER may experience a delay.""

 

 One local witness said he saw the SUV on the flatbed tow truck, both stalled on the tracks. The witness said the train crossing arm dropped on the SUV and a moment later, the train slammed into the tow truck.

The witness caught the entire crash on tape. The video shows the truck driver’s door closing and then the truck turning away from the train just moments before the collision.

A witness who works across the street from the train tracks said the sound of the fatal crash was horrific.

“It's somewhere between an explosion and thunder. You know, when metal hits metal it makes a noise unto itself,” explained witness Thomas Neely.

The white SUV was left in place at the intersection.

Moments after the crash, people nearby tried to help and scrambled to find survivors.

One witness said the driver was ejected from his tow truck and thrown some 100 yards from the crash site. On the witness video, people seemed to cover the body of the victim while waiting for emergency crews to arrive.

“Anybody else back there?” a person searching for survivors at the crash site says on the video.

 

 Another resident who lives near the site of the crash told NBC 7 that the impact from the collision shook his whole house.

 

 It’s unclear how fast the train was traveling at impact, but the southbound Amtrak train came to a stop about half a mile away from the Chesterfield Drive crossing.

 

 Pieces of the tow truck were strewn around the train tracks for hundreds of yards after the crash, including the flatbed, a wheel and even the massive engine block that landed about 200 yards away.

 

 Numerous workers from the company TOWEX later arrived at the scene. The towing company responds to AAA calls.

 

 The company told NBC 7 it wants to respect the privacy of the victim’s family, so his name was not released. One source confirmed the man had a wife and young daughter.

The Medical Examiner’s office will identify the victim at a later time.

 

 Most people nearby were saddened to hear that a man lost his life in the crash on the train tracks, including Neely.

 

 “I'm sorry to hear that a mother lost her son, especially during the holidays. There's never a good time but it's just, it's tragic,” said Neely.

 

 The two women who drove the SUV were not injured.

Caltrain Hits, & Kills a Pedestrian near the Hayward Park Station
San Mateo, CA -In the bustling heart of San Mateo, a routine Caltrain journey took a tragic turn, casting a somber shadow over the community. This incident, occurring near the Hayward Park station, serves as a poignant reminder of the unforeseen dangers that can arise in our daily commutes.
The Incident
On January 18, 2024, at approximately 11:33 a.m., a harrowing incident unfolded near the Hayward Park station in San Mateo, shaking the local community. A northbound Caltrain, making its routine journey from San Jose to San Francisco, tragically struck an individual. The collision, occurring just north of Highway 92, instantly turned an ordinary Thursday morning into a scene of emergency and despair.
The impact of the collision was immediate and fatal, claiming the life of the person struck by the train. The incident caused a significant interruption to the Caltrain service, with emergency responders quickly arriving at the scene. While there were 78 passengers aboard the train, thankfully, no other injuries were reported. The swift response of the emergency services underscored the seriousness of the situation, as they worked diligently to manage the aftermath and provide support.
In the hours following the accident, the area around Hayward Park station became a focal point of investigation and recovery efforts. Caltrain officials and local authorities worked together to understand the circumstances leading to this tragic event. The station’s northbound platform was temporarily closed, and trains were rerouted to the southbound platform, highlighting the operational challenges such incidents pose to public transportation systems.
Legal Implications
The tragic incident at the Hayward Park station in San Mateo brings to light significant legal implications, particularly in the realm of public transportation safety and pedestrian rights. In such cases, the investigation focuses on determining the cause of the accident and whether any negligence or breach of safety protocols contributed to the tragedy. This could involve examining train operation procedures, signal systems, and the actions of the train operator and the victim at the time of the incident.
Nationally, pedestrian accidents involving trains are a concerning issue. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, there were over 2,000 railway-related accidents in the United States in 2021, many involving pedestrians at crossings and along tracks. These statistics highlight the ongoing need for stringent safety measures and public awareness campaigns to prevent such accidents.
For victims and their families, navigating the aftermath of a train-related accident can be complex and emotionally taxing. This is where the expertise of a personal injury attorney becomes invaluable. A skilled train accident attorney can provide guidance on the legal options available, help in dealing with insurance claims, and ensure that the victim’s rights are protected. In cases like the San Mateo Caltrain incident, legal representation is crucial in seeking justice and compensation for the losses incurred.
The heartrending incident at San Mateo’s Hayward Park station is a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of accidents and the profound impact they can have on individuals and communities.

- Florida's Brightline train has brought higher-speed rail to the Sunshine State
- But is vexed by fatal collisions with pedestrians and motorists at crossings
- Per mile traveled, the line has the highest fatality rate of any US railroad
Florida's Brightline train has brought speedy rail travel to the Sunshine State, but is plagued by an alarmingly high rate of fatalities at railroad crossings.
At least 108 people have died on Brightline tracks since it began operations in July 2017, or roughly one death for every 38,000 miles traveled, the worst rate in the nation and three times higher than the second-worst railroad, according to an Associated Press analysis.
Earlier this month, Brightline trains fatally struck vehicles in two separate incidents just days apart at the same crossing, killing a total of three people.
In those cases, and many of the other fatalities, drivers appear to be ignoring crossing lights and driving around gates as they try to outrun the train. Most other fatalities on Brightline tracks appear to be suicides.
Brightline has not been faulted for operator or equipment error in any of the fatal incidents, but the alarming statistics have raised questions about what can be done to reduce deaths along the company's tracks.
Emergency personnel work the scene where a Brightline passenger train collided with a sport utility vehicle in Melbourne, Florida on January 10
At least 108 people have died on Brightline tracks since it began operations in July 2017, or roughly one death for every 38,000 miles traveled, the worst rate in the nation
A Brightline spokeswoman did not respond to request for comment from DailyMail.com this week.
After test runs in 2017, Brightline launched passenger service in 2018, connecting Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.
Last fall, the service expanded to offer trains between Miami and Orlando, with a further extension planned to reach Tampa.
The bright, neon yellow trains travel at speeds up to 125 mph in some locations. The 3.5-hour, 235-mile trip between Miami and Orlando takes about 30 minutes less than the average drive.
Brightline is the only privately owned and operated inter-city rail service in the US, and has been a rare American passenger rail success story, in contrast to California's long-delayed plans to build high-speed rail from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
Last month, Brightline's private backers got a $3 billion boost from the Biden administration for a new planned route between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area, as part of a national push to expand passenger rail service.
But the company has been vexed by reckless and deadly behavior at crossings, leading Brightline officials and regulators searching for solutions.
Earlier this month, two fatal incidents at the same crossing underscored the urgency of the problem.
On January 10, 62-year-old Charles Julian Phillips was killed when the vehicle he was driving was hit by the train at a crossing along the US 1 corridor in Melbourne, on Florida's Atlantic coast
Three passengers in that vehicle were injured, according to Melbourne police.
Then on January 12, driver Lisa Ann Batchelder, 52, and passenger Michael Anthony Degasperi, 54, were killed at the same crossing.

Half of those killed by Brightline trains were listed as either walking or running on the tracks
Melbourne Mayor Paul Alfrey said it appeared that the SUV they were in tried to outrun the train.
He said he's spoken to Brightline officials about doing another public safety campaign to warn drivers not to go around railroad crossings, emphasizing that the train is traveling at higher speeds.
'I start by saying if the arm is down, don't go around,' Alfrey told Orlando television station WKMG.
'There's no good outcome with a train. This is an unfortunate situation. We have the loss of life again. There´s safety precautions for a reason, and people need to adhere them.'
The National Transportation Safety Board said it would investigate the two fatal crashes.
'Investigators will work to better understand the safety issues at this crossing and will examine opportunities to prevent or mitigate these crashes in the future,' NTSB spokeswoman Sarah Taylor Sulick told the Associated Press last week.
She said a preliminary report will be released within 30 days, and a final report will be issued in 12 to 24 months.
Brightline's fatality rates stump experts
In 2022, the last full year of data available, trains killed at least 922 people in the US, according to federal data.
In raw numbers, major cargo carrier Union Pacific had the most fatal incidents that year, with 233, followed by Amtrak with 143.
But Brightline's fatality rate is higher when factoring in the number of miles traveled by trains on the Florida passenger line, a number far lower than the national carriers.
According to the AP analysis, California's Caltrain commuter line has the second-worst fatality rate in the nation among US railroads that log at least 100,000 train-miles a year.
Caltrain as averaged one death for every 125,000 miles since 2017, a rate more than three times lower than Brightline.
After test runs in 2017, Brightline launched passenger service in 2018, connecting Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach
Last fall, the service expanded to offer trains between Miami and Orlando, with a further extension planned to reach Tampa
Brightline's fatality rates have confounded experts. The passenger service shares tracks with with Florida East Coast, a freight line that has a far lower death rate.
Suicide is a major contributor to Brightline's death rates, and the line's fast and bright-yellow trains may be somehow more appealing to the suicidal.
Federal data does not readily reveal whether suicide was a factor in deaths on railroad tracks, although reportedly more than half of train deaths nationwide are a result of suicide.
A Treasure Coast News analysis of the narrative accounts in federal incident reports found that suicides accounted for at least 7 percent of Brightline's fatal incidents in 2022.
The federal reports filed by Brightline typically describe how an engineer spotted someone on the tracks, sounded the horn and hit the emergency brake, but the person was fatally struck.
A full-speed Brightline train takes a quarter-mile to stop.
Local police reports are much more gruesome, particularly in their descriptions of what happens to a person hit by a train.
The engineer and conductor, having seen the terror or despair on the victim’s face, are often grief-stricken, detectives report.
Several Brightline engineers and conductors have witnessed numerous deaths, some within weeks of each other.

The first incident was a train vs. pedestrian collision, about 1:45 p.m., near the Highway 120 and McHenry Avenue railroad crossing. The victim was identified as Paul Lopez, 63, of Escalon and authorities said he was struck by an Amtrak train. There was also a freight train in the area, apparently stopped on the tracks, and eyewitnesses said the man appeared to walk around the downed crossing arms to get past the freight train when he was struck. The investigation is continuing, taken over by Amtrak Police.

A couple hours later, just after 4 p.m., an Escalon woman died as a result of injuries sustained when the SUV she was driving collided with a hay squeeze along Highway 120 near Sexton Road. She was identified as Glenda Mancilla Larios, 38, of Escalon. The crash also resulted in major injuries to the driver of the farm equipment – with a lengthy extrication required – and authorities said there were minor passengers in the SUV who were injured and taken to area hospitals. No information was available on their condition. That accident also remains under investigation, being handled by the CHP.

Assisting with the incidents were Escalon Police, Escalon Community Ambulance and Escalon Fire Department personnel, with additional support from Escalon Public Works and Escalon Unified School District personnel at the train/pedestrian collision.

RIGHT NOW, WIND COMING DOWN FROM THE NORTH. IT’S PRETTY LIGHT AND FAINT THERE IN YUBA CITY, UP TO FIVE MILES AN HOUR IN SACRAMENTO IN A WEST WIND AT SIX. CURRENTLY STEPPING OUT IN STOCKTON.

AND THIS MORNING THE GANG’S ALL HERE. MOMENT IN TRAFFIC. WE HAVE BRIAN HICKEY AND LIVECOPTER3 MOMENTARILY DOWN HERE IN THE STUDIO. WE ARE CLEARING A LOT OF INCIDENTS IN SACRAMENTO AREA. SPECIFICALLY, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR MAP, WE ARE ALL IN THE GREEN. WE DO HAVE SOMETHING IN ORANGE VALE THAT MELANIE WINGO WILL DETAIL IN A MOMENT, BUT NOT AFFECTING ANY TRAFFIC. SO THAT’S GREAT. DOWN ON I-5 SOUTHBOUND, SOUTH OF STOCKTON, EVEN THERE, THERE WAS A WRECK EARLIER. THERE ARE PIECES OF THOSE CARS IN THE ROADWAY AND THEY ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM THAT WRECK. MINOR INJURY, WRECK. ALSO SOMETHING HAPPENING IN COPPEROPOLIS JUST POPPED UP ON THE MAP. I KNOW IT’S REMOTE, BUT A CAR DROVE THROUGH 250FT OF FENCE LINE AND ALL OF THAT’S IN THE ROADWAY. IF YOU’RE COPPEROPOLIS VIEWER THAT IS HAPPENING, PLEASE BE AWARE. OTHER THAN THAT, TRACY TRIANGLE IS REALLY OUR ONLY PAIN POINT THIS MORNING IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC. NO INCIDENT THERE, JUST A LOT OF SLOW AND GO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN. THOSE ARE YOUR DRIVE TIMES. 29 MINUTES I-5 TO 580. EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE YELLOW AND SACRAMENTO LOOKING BEAUTIFUL. BACK TO YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. AND IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, OUR OWN BRIAN HICKEY WILL BE FLYING OVERHEAD UP IN THE AIR FROM THE NEW AND IMPROVED LIVECOPTER3. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE STORY HE DID ON ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY INSIDE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. IT IS PRETTY AWESOME. IT’S KIND OF A GAME CHANGER, SO IT’S NEAT. YEAH. WE’LL JOIN BRIAN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES. THE MEANTIME, RIGHT NOW, PART OF A MAJOR STREET IN ORANGEVILLE HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF BECAUSE OF A VEHICLE THAT CRASHED INTO A UTILITY POLE. THIS WAS ON GREENBACK LANE NEAR HAZEL AVENUE. CREWS GOT THE CALL THERE AROUND 2 A.M. OUR MELANIE WINGO JOINS US LIVE WITH THE WORK THAT’S UNDERWAY. AND IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE THEY HAVE OPENED IT. MELANIE OKAY, SO JUST WITHIN THE LAST TWO MINUTES SINCE WE SAW YOU RIGHT AT THE TOP OF OUR 6 A.M. NEWSCAST, THEY HAVE MOVED IN. THE BIG GUNS, THE BIG TRUCKS FOR SMUD, AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN A NEW POWER POLE THAT WE EXPECT WILL BE REPLACING THIS ONE THAT IS NOW LEANING OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SO WE SEE BIGGER SMUD VEHICLES EVEN THAN WE SAW IN OUR LAST HALF HOUR. NOW IN PLACE STAGING READY TO BEGIN WORK ON THIS POWER POLE THAT WAS HIT BY A CAR OVERNIGHT. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF PHOTOGRAPHS THAT A VIEWER SENT US A SHORT TIME AGO, THAT THIS IS HOW THINGS LOOKED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT CAR CRASHED INTO THE POWER POLE, RIGHT NOW, IT’S NOT KNOWN WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH OR HOW THE DRIVER IS DOING. ACCORDING TO CHP, THAT’S ALL UNDER INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW, BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED, THE CAR WAS JUST BEING TOWED AWAY AND CHP OFFICERS AT THE SCENE SAID THIS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE MORNING COMMUTE OUT HERE AT GREENBACK LANE, RIGHT AT BRAZIL, WHERE WE’RE JUST WEST OF HAZEL AVENUE, RIGHT IN THE ORANGEVILLE AREA. IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PART OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY, RESTORING POWER TO THE 25 CUSTOMERS AFFECTED IS THE GOAL. ALSO MAKING SURE THIS KEY PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS SAFE BECAUSE AS WE’RE LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE STABLE WHATSOEVER. SO THEY’VE GOT THE LINES DE-ENERGIZED THE CREWS OUT HERE AND JUST JUST AGAIN WITHIN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES OR SO, THEY HAVE REALLY PUT THESE BIGGER VEHICLES INTO POSITION AND IT APPEARS THEY’RE MAKING SOME PRETTY QUICK WORK OF GETTING RIGHT TO IT. THOSE CREWS WERE OUT HERE ASSESSING FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND NOW THEY ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THEY GOT ALL THE MACHINERY OUT AND READY TO GO, AND WE’RE GOING TO SEE THEIR PROGRESS OUT HERE AS THEY MAKE IT TO TRY TO GET THIS POLE PUT UP. SO WE’LL REPORT BACK IN JUST A BIT WITH THEIR PROGRESS. ALL RIGHT. BACK TO YOU IN THE STUDIO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IN THE MEANTIME, AN ACCUSED SERIAL KILLER DUE TO BE BACK IN COURT THIS MORNING IN STOCKTON. HERE’S SOME VIDEO NOW OF WESLEY BROWNLEE FROM A COURT APPEARANCE EARLIER THIS YEAR. HE’S ACCUSED OF KILLING SEVEN PEOPLE OVER 18 MONTHS. FIVE OF THEM HAPPEN IN STOCKTON. TWO OCCURRED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. BROWNLEE IS ALSO ACCUSED OF THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF AN EIGHTH PERSON WHO WAS SHOT, BUT SURVIVED. TODAY’S HEARING IS A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY. SO THAT MEANS EITHER HIS DEFENSE TEAM WILL ASK PROSECUTORS TO TURN OVER EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, OR PROSECUTORS WILL ASK THE DEFENSE FOR INFORMATION IN THEIR CASE. A 606 NOW. NOW TO MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE A HELICOPTER ACCIDENT KILLED IRAN’S PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER. MIKE CHERRY IS JOINING US NOW WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AND ALSO WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. YEAH. SO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO. IT JUST SHOWS THE HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS THAT FIRST RESPONDERS WERE DEALING WITH WHEN THEY TRIED TO HEAD TO THAT CRASH SITE. OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT RESTRICTED VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE POOR WEATHER IS WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH. IRAN’S PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER WERE RETURNING FROM A COMMEMORATION EVENT WHEN THE CRASH TOOK PLACE, KILLING EIGHT PEOPLE IN ALL. THIS COMES DURING A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. IRAN ARMS RUSSIA IN ITS WAR AGAINST UKRAINE, AND THEN IT ALSO ATTACKED ISRAEL AMID ITS ONGOING WAR AGAINST HAMAS. NOW THE PRESIDENT POSITION IN IRAN IS SEEN AS A SECOND IN COMMAND BEHIND THE SUPREME LEADER. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS THE TOP ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THAT COUNTRY. STILL, OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL IN THE COUNTRY. EARLIER THIS MORNING, IRAN’S CABINET ANNOUNCED THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT IS TAKING OVER THE POSITION UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAPPENS WITHIN THE NEXT 50 DAYS. TAHOE. ALL RIGHT, MIKE, THANK YOU. WELL, THIS MORNING, A MAN IS IN JAIL ACCUSED OF MOLESTING A FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL THAT VICTIM IS NOW A TEENAGER AND REPORTED IT TO HER FAMILY. NOW, THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE MORE VICTIMS. KCRA 3’S LETICIA ORDAZ LIVE NOW IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WITH MORE ON WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS YOUR HELP. DURANTE OH GOOD MORNING. THIS IS A VERY DISTURBING CASE IN OUR REGION. THAT MAN IS NOW AT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY JAIL WHERE HE CAN’T HURT ANYONE. BUT ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, HE WAS A KARATE INSTRUCTOR IN TOWN. HE WAS ALSO A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER, SO HE HAD ACCESS TO A LOT OF KIDS. THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE COULD BE MORE VICTIMS WHO SIMPLY HAVEN’T COME FORWARD YET. SO THIS IS HOW THIS STORY UNFOLDED. ON FRIDAY, A WOMAN CALLED THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE TO REPORT HER TEENAGE DAUGHTER WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED WHEN SHE WAS JUST FOUR YEARS OLD BY A FAMILY FRIEND. DETECTIVES ENDED UP ARRESTING THE SUSPECT, 49 YEAR OLD JASON PRATER, AFTER THEY SAY HE MADE SOME ADMISSIONS AND CONFIRMED SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF THE GIRL’S STATEMENT. DEPUTIES SAY BEFORE HIS ARREST ON FRIDAY, PRATER WORKED AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER AT JOHN ADAMS ACADEMY IN ROSEVILLE, AND DEPUTIES TELL US PRATER PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT OPTIONS FOR YOUTH CHARTER SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO UNTIL LAST AUGUST. PRATER WAS ALSO A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR IN THE SACRAMENTO AND ROSEVILLE AREAS, AND INVESTIGATORS WANT FAMILIES TO COME FORWARD IF THEY SUSPECT THEIR CHILD COULD BE A VICTIM, COME FORWARD, BRING THIS INFORMATION TO US. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AGAIN, ANYTHING THAT HE’S BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR, HE’S HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR. AND AGAIN, I DON’T CARE IF IT HAPPENED 20 YEARS AGO, 30 YEARS AGO. DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT. PLEASE BRING THAT INFORMATION. ANY LITTLE TIDBIT CAN HELP US AGAIN. KEEP HIM LOCKED AWAY. OUR BIGGEST THING RIGHT NOW, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN’T VICTIMIZE ANYONE ELSE. AND PRATER WILL FACE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SACRAMENTO. HE FACES TWO COUNTS OF CHILD MOLESTATION, AND RIGHT NOW, HIS BAIL HAS BEEN SET. AT $2.1 MILLION. REPORTING LIVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY, LETICIA ORDAZ KCRA THREE NEWS. ALL RIGHT, LETICIA, THANK YOU. 609 NOW, WE DID REACH OUT TO JOHN ADAMS ACADEMY IN ROSEVILLE TO COMMENT ON THE ARREST OF THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. AT THIS POINT, NO WORD BACK.

A California police officer pulled a man out of his wheelchair and to safety on Wednesday, moments before he would have been crushed by an oncoming train, dramatic video of the rescue showed.

Lodi police officer Erika Urrea and Sgt. Steve Maynard were on patrol in their Central Valley community when they spotted the 66-year-old man in his wheelchair, stuck on tracks as crossing guards were coming down and a train approached at 8:44 a.m. PT, officials said.

Urrea was driving and she barely caught sight the prone pedestrian out of the corner of her eye.

""So I happen to kind of look to the side and notice there was a man in a wheelchair, and he seemed to be almost wiggling, like he was stuck,"" Urrea told ""NBC Nightly News"" on Thursday.

Urrea's body camera captured the life-and-death seconds, as she sprinted from her squad car to the pedestrian, stuck on Lodi Avenue.

""Can you get up?"" Urrea can be heard frantically asking on the bodycam video.

She unbuckled him, grabbed his torso and pulled him up out of the chair.

""Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!"" Urrea screamed n the video while the Union Pacific train fast approached and she pulled him away.

Urrea and the man fell to ground as the train smashed through his wheelchair feet away.

""I need an ambulance now!"" Urrea yelled out, with the sound of the train still speeding past.

As these terrifying seconds unfolded, Urrea said she didn't have enough time to become afraid. But 24 hours later, the veteran police officer admitted the video was hard to watch.

""I was trying to figure out 'OK, where's the train? I don't know how fast the train is going. How much time do I have?' But my goal was, 'I need to get him off the tracks,'"" Urrea said.

""Honestly, it seems like I'm watching someone else's video. It's very surreal ... it was scary to watch.""

The man was taken to the hospital and he was in stable condition on Thursday.

""As the incident happened very quickly we believe the chair wheel was stuck in the groove between the railroad track and the cement,"" Lodi police Lt. Michael Manetti said.

The 36-year-old single mom, who has beenon the job for 14 years, said — unsurprisingly — there's no training for dealing with a speeding train.

""No, nothing this specific at least,"" Urrea laughed, adding that she'll never forget Wednesday's rescue. ""The most memorable ... probably the scariest incident that I've been involved with so far.""

The officer's supervisors hailed her quick thinking and decisive action.

“We are very proud of Officer Urrea and her heroic actions,"" Lodi police Capt. David Griffin said in a statement on Thursday. ""Thanks to her awareness and quick action she was able to save the man’s life at great personal risk to herself. This is another shining example of the brave actions the men and women of law enforcement exhibit every day.”

The video has been viewed millions of times across the world since Lodi police first published it on their YouTube page late Wednesday afternoon.

Former pro basketball player Rex Chapman, a prolific social media scraper who can make video go viral just by sharing it with his 918,000 followers, posted the clip on Wednesday night. And on his feed alone, it took just 17 hours for Lodi clip to reach a million views.

""Oh. My. God,"" Chapman wrote, summing up the video's content.

A Sacramento TV news anchor, with just 4,500 followers, also had a million views of the video in about the same time frame as Chapman's post.

Urrea shrugged off being called a hero and insisted anyone in her position would have acted as she did.

""I honestly don't think I did anything special. I know all the people that I work with would have done the same thing,"" the officer said Thursday.

""I just did what I felt that anybody in my situation would have done and something that I felt like, if that was my family member or friend that was stuck, I would want someone to come out and help.""

The San Joaquin County community of Lodi, with a population of 67,000, is about 90 miles northeast of San Francisco and 40 miles south of Sacramento.

The death went unreported until now because Caltrain has a new policy of not telling the public when a train hits a person, in an effort to stop copycat suicides.

The coroner’s office hasn’t determined if the death was an accident or a suicide. Williams died from blunt force injuries at Stanford Hospital on Aug. 21, the coroner’s office said.

Palo Alto Councilman Pat Burt said at a city Rail Committee meeting on Aug. 20 that Caltrain is trying to make security improvements, like the detection system that alerts police when someone is on the tracks in Palo Alto.

“Caltrain is just beginning the process of appraising what would be involved with a corridor-wide best practices, from San Francisco to San Jose at a minimum, what it would cost, and how to pursue funding and implement it,” Burt said.

Since Caltrain stopped reporting suicides in May, there have been at least three deaths on the tracks. Strikes went unreported on May 12 and July 1, Caltrain spokesman Dan Lieberman said.

Trains were delayed for hours after a disruption in Sunnyvale, but a Caltrain spokesman wouldn’t say the reason.

Dylan Scirpo, 17, of Menlo Park, was hit on Aug. 11 before starting his senior year at Menlo-Atherton High School.

The Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University did a study on 193 Caltrain fatalities between August 1992 and December 2009, trying to find any patterns.

The study found that Caltrain deaths stayed around 10 a year, and there wasn’t any particular hot spot along the tracks.

“The factors that cause suicides are external to the system,” said the study, led by professor Jan Botha.

The study counted 123 suicides and 70 unintended deaths, from issues like cars stalling on the tracks, drivers going around gates or pedestrians crossing where they aren’t supposed to. That means 64% of the deaths along the tracks are suicides.

Caltrain switched to single-tracking, and another southbound train picked the passengers up from the Broadway station soon after. Train delays of half an hour or less continued into the afternoon, he said. Police directed car traffic past the crossing, which was blocked off while it was being cleared. “Sometimes it can be far worse,” White said, noting that there were no injuries. Store manager Fabiana Pires was working at Maverick Jack’s when she thought she had heard something falling in the kitchen. It turned out to be the sound of the train hitting the truck. It looked like the train had struck the back of the truck, which then clipped an SUV, she said. First responders on the scene did not want to comment, though Pires said the driver of the SUV had no injuries but was taken away in an ambulance. “It was a scary scene,” said John Kevranian, co-owner of Nuts for Candy & Toys on Broadway and president of the Broadway Burlingame Business Improvement District. He heard sirens, and walked to the intersection about 10 minutes after the crash. When he saw the train stopped on the tracks, he thought a car or pedestrian had been hit. “There were ambulances, there were fire trucks, all kinds of emergency people there,” he said. A crossing arm, the bar that comes down between traffic and the tracks when a train comes by, was damaged. A crew from Caltrain was working on it when the truck pulled away from the crossing and parked around the corner more than an hour after being struck. The Broadway crossing has a reputation for being dangerous. There has been a push for “grade separation,” turning the crossing into an underpass to let trains pass over traffic instead of through it.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A Caltrain struck and killed a person on the tracks in San Francisco on Thursday morning.

Northbound train No. 103, heading from San Jose to San Francisco, struck the person at 6:32 a.m. between Tunnels 2 and 3 near the 22nd Street station, according to the transit agency.

No injuries were reported among the roughly 75 people aboard the train at the time, and the person struck was trespassing on the tracks, Caltrain officials said.

The collision initially stopped trains from going through the area in either direction. The southbound tracks reopened shortly before 8 a.m. and the northbound tracks reopened by 8:22 a.m., according to Caltrain.

Authorities are working to determine whether the death was intentional or accidental. The name of the person killed has not been released.

A woman miraculously survived after her car — which was trapped between backed-up traffic and a railroad crossing arm — was hit by a 78 mph Caltrain in Menlo Park tonight (Oct. 23), according to Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman.
The woman, who is in her 30s, was headed west on Ravenswood Avenue at 6:15 p.m. when she stopped on the railroad tracks between Alma Street and El Camino Real. When the crossing lights lit up, indicating a train was on its way, she was stuck. The cars in front of her and behind her wouldn’t move, even though she was frantically honking her horn.
“She was honking, but there was not a whole lot of room for her to move,” Schapelhouman said.
Witnesses told firefighters that the train lifted the car off the ground. The car was thrown into the air and landed parallel with the train tracks. The woman was still in the car.
The train was headed south at 78 mph. The train was not damaged and did not stop, according to Schapelhouman.
Remarkably, after the train passed and the car hit the ground, the woman was able to drive the vehicle. She circled back to park in the Caltrain parking lot, saying that something “didn’t feel right” when she drove her car — only to find out that the back of her car had been sheared off.
“It’s amazing the car was still drivable and she wasn’t more severely insured or even killed,” said Battalion Chief Dan Coyle.
The woman was taken to Stanford Hospital after complaining of neck and back pains.
This is not the first time someone has been stuck on the tracks at that location during rush hour. On Feb. 23, 2015, Jahyun Jennifer Koo, 35, of Palo Alto, died when she became trapped between a railroad gate and a car stopped by traffic in front of her.
Her death resulted in a lawsuit against Caltrain, San Mateo County and the city of Menlo Park. The outcome of the lawsuit wasn’t available tonight.
Koo’s death also prompted the city to install temporary medians on Ravenswood Avenue from Alma to Noel Drive to prevent left-hand turns onto Ravenswood from Alma Street.
“This at-grade crossing is notorious for many significant near misses and sadly tragic accidents involving the loss of life. It’s a poorly designed crossing exacerbated by people who are in a hurry and not paying attention that can then suddenly find themselves in harm’s way,” said Schapelhouman. “The train can’t swerve to avoid an impact and if the Express is coming through it takes about a mile for it to slow down and stop because it’s going about 80 mph. This should have been improved years ago, but the debate on how to fix this crossing has gone on for decades … in the meantime our firefighters continue to directly deal with the very real deadly consequences and close calls associated with it.”
After decades of squabbling over how to separate the train tracks from the road at Ravenswood, the council decided earlier this year to raise the tracks and lower the road at Ravenswood. It’s estimated the separation will cost $190 million.",Caltrain,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,10,23,2023,6,PM,Unknown,Unknown,San Mateo,CA,06,Menlo Park,Ravenswood Avenue,A,Car,78,2,4,Trapped on crossing by traffic,1,Caltrain,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,3,Caltrain,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,78,R,2,South,1,Gates,Crossing lights,A,Dry,1,Both sides,1,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,2,30s,2,Female,2,No,4,Stopped on crossing,3,Unknown,7,Unknown,1,Yes,1,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,No,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"A woman miraculously survived after her car — which was trapped between backed-up traffic and a railroad crossing arm — was hit by a 78 mph Caltrain in Menlo Park tonight (Oct. 23).

He said there are a lot of homeless people that usually congregate in the area at night.

The Amtrak Pacific Surfliner stuck a semi hauling fertilizer that was stuck on the tracks just south of Guadalupe on Friday morning. There were no injuries reported. California Highway Patrol

Amtrak Pacific Surfliner passengers faced long delays after Train 774 struck a tractor trailer carrying fertilizer just south of Guadalupe early Friday morning.





California Highway Patrol Santa Maria spokesman Efrem Moore said there were no injuries reported in the collision, which occurred sometime between when dispatch first received a call of a semi stuck on the tracks at 7:39 a.m. and when emergency personnel showed up at 7:45 a.m.

Though the semi was loaded with ammonium nitrate for the nearby fields, Moore said “none of that was released” in the collision.

While the accident scene was cleared, Amtrak passengers were bused to the station in Santa Barbara, where those heading farther south boarded Train 782, according to an Amtrak Twitter statement.

The latest death — involving a a 19-year-old woman — occurred at about 9:15 a.m. on the tracks beneath the Glen Annie overpass in Goleta, according to Capt. Dave Zaniboni of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.



​



The victim, whose name was not released pending notification of relatives, was declared dead at the scene, said Kelly Hoover, a Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman.


“Witness statements indicated the actions of the decedent immediately prior to the collision suggest this was an apparent suicide,” Hoover said.



The train involved was a southbound Pacific Surfliner, according to a passenger who contacted Noozhawk.



Santa Barbara County sheriff’s deputies and coroner’s personnel were on scene investigating.



Rail traffic in the area was shut down for a time while emergency personnel recovered the victim’s remains.









The train — No. 774— was delayed to allow for a change of crews, which is standard procedure following a fatal accident.



The death comes just two days after a southbound Amtrak train struck and killed a pedestrian Friday afternoon near Lookout Park in Summerland.



That incident occurred just before 4:30 p.m. near the intersection of Finney Street and Wallace Avenue.

The latest death — involving a 19-year-old woman — occurred at about 9:15 a.m. on the tracks beneath the Glen Annie overpass in Goleta, according to Capt. Dave Zaniboni of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. The victim, whose name was not released pending notification of relatives, was declared dead at the scene, said Kelly Hoover, a Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman. “Witness statements indicated the actions of the decedent immediately prior to the collision suggest this was an apparent suicide,” Hoover said. The train involved was a southbound Pacific Surfliner, according to a passenger who contacted Noozhawk. Santa Barbara County sheriff’s deputies and coroner’s personnel were on scene investigating. Rail traffic in the area was shut down for a time while emergency personnel recovered the victim’s remains. The train — No. 774 — was delayed to allow for a change of crews, which is standard procedure following a fatal accident. The death comes just two days after a southbound Amtrak train struck and killed a pedestrian Friday afternoon near Lookout Park in Summerland. That incident occurred just before 4:30 p.m. near the intersection of Finney Street and Wallace Avenue. “The decedent appears to be in his 50s, but his identity is unknown at this time,” Hoover said on Sunday.

January 14, 2016

A Cal Poly student who was struck and killed by a train Saturday evening committed suicide, the San Luis Obispo County coroner’s unit has ruled. In a separate investigation, the coroner’s unit has determined a transient woman who was hit by a train five days prior died accidentally.

Aaron Matthew Wolf, 19, was struck by an Amtrak train around 8:15 p.m. Saturday about a mile south of San Luis Obispo. Responders pronounced him dead at the scene.

On Wednesday, coroner’s investigators performed an autopsy and determined the manner of Wolf’s death was a suicide. The official cause of the Cal Poly student’s death was multiple blunt force trauma, according to a county sheriff’s office press release.

Toxicology results are expected to be available in six to eight weeks.

Wolf was from Martinez, California. He was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Cal Poly.

The fraternity has launched a GoFundMe page to help raise money for the memorial service. The page has raised $10,065 as of Thursday morning.

“Arron was an intelligent guy who would always be able to put a warm smile on your face,” the fundraising page states. “He was very talented in a vast array of things, from playing musical instruments to beating everyone in super smash bros.”

On the evening of Jan. 4, Saralee Lua, 54, was struck by a train near The Graduate in San Luis Obispo. Lua died of her injuries at the hospital.

The Sherif’s office announced Wednesday the manner of Lua’s death is listed as accidental and the official cause is exsanguination from blunt force trauma injuries. Toxicology results are also pending in this case.

Last weekend, there were also two individuals who were struck and killed by trains in Santa Barbara County. At least one of the deaths is suspected to have been a suicide.

A 19-year-old woman died yesterday (Sept. 27) after she was hit by a Caltrain in San Mateo, according to the coroner’s office.
The coroner’s office identified the victim as Mariana Reinoso-Barreto of San Mateo. The fatal accident occurred near the Villa Terrace at-grade crossing in San Mateo.
Only six days earlier, Caltrain officials celebrated the start of electric train service.
The coroner’s office hasn’t determined if the death was an accident or a suicide.
This was the 12th death on the Caltrain tracks this year. Between 1992 and 2009, Caltrain averaged 10 deaths a year, according to research by the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University.
In May, Caltrain decided to stop reporting deaths that occur on the tracks in the hopes they would diminish. San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus, whose office has the contract to provide police services for the Caltrain line from San Francisco to Gilroy, went along with Caltrain’s censorship decision even though other first-responder agencies, such as police and fire departments, have not.

The news blackout doesn’t appear to be reducing deaths, since this is the 12th fatality on the tracks in 2024, which is higher than the average for an entire year, and it’s only the ninth month of the year.


Passengers report train deaths on social media, and some news outlets, such as the Daily Post, confirm the deaths through other official sources such as fire departments and coroners.

Caltrain Media Relations Manager Tasha Bartholomew said at 8:43 p.m., southbound train 678 struck and killed a person at the Churchill Avenue grade crossing in Palo Alto.

Bartholomew said at 9:19 p.m. that emergency personnel were at the scene and train service was stopped at the incident area.

There are approximately 46 passengers onboard, with no other injuries reported. This is Caltrain’s second fatality of the year.

The person was identified as Stanford graduate student Jonathan San Miguel, according to an April 17 letter by Susie Brubaker-Cole, vice provost for student affairs.

Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin told this news organization that the district doesn’t have any reason to believe the person who died was affiliated with the school district.

Train 678 was released at 10:22 p.m. Northbound tracks were reopened through the area at 9:48 p.m. with speed restrictions of 20 mph.

The San Mateo County Sheriff’s Transit Police Bureau is investigating the fatal incident.

The driver of the Tesla reportedly tried to beat the train through the crossing, NBC Bay Area learned.

Witnesses told NBC Bay Area the Tesla driver was sitting on the tracks and distracted when the crossing arm came down on the car. She reportedly exited the car, moved the arm off the vehicle then tried to beat the train.

A Capitol Corridor train slammed into a Tesla on the tracks Wednesday morning in Santa Clara.

Police, VTA and work crews showed up to the scene where parts of the car were thrown in all directions.

A passing driver who works near the scene of the incident told NBC Bay Area a large section of the Tesla's drive train actually hit his car.

The driver of that car, Emilio Martinez, is a licensed EMT and was able to help the Tesla driver who sustained minor injuries, police said.

The Capitol Corridor train was delayed as crews checked for damage and fortunately, no passengers were injured.

Witnesses who saw the incident happened are shaken up, but relieved.

A crash with a train is definitely one of them. Fortunately for a driver in Santa Clara, she happened to be inside a Tesla, and she was able to escape the frightening ordeal with minor injuries. 



The incident happened on Wednesday morning when a Capitol Corridor train smashed into what appears to be a Midnight Silver Tesla Model Y on the 600 block of Martin Avenue in Santa Clara. Videos taken of the incident’s aftermath show a crushed Tesla with its airbags deployed. 



As noted in a report from NBC Bay Area, the driver of the Tesla reportedly tried to beat the train through the crossing — an incredibly dangerous move and one that could have easily claimed a life. According to witnesses interviewed by the news outlet, the Tesla driver was reportedly sitting on the tracks when the crossing arm came down on the vehicle. 



The Tesla driver reportedly seemed distracted when the crossing arm hit the electric car. Witnesses were then shocked to see the driver reportedly exit the vehicle to move the arm off the Tesla. The driver then reportedly tried to beat the train but was unsuccessful. The train smashed into the all-electric vehicle, and its parts ended up being thrown in all directions. 



Despite the Tesla driver’s apparent carelessness and recklessness, she was ultimately lucky. One driver, Emilio Martinez, whose vehicle was hit by a large section of the Tesla, was actually a licensed EMT, so he ended up being the first responder on the scene. The Tesla driver didn’t respond to the EMT at first, though later statements from the police indicated that the EV driver only sustained minor injuries. No passengers from the train were injured during the crash as well. 
Ultimately, crashes such as this are among the reasons why Tesla is pushing the development of technologies like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. Systems like FSD tend to drive conservatively and cautiously, and they do not get distracted. Thus, when solutions such as FSD are fully rolled out, instances of accidents from distracted drivers would likely see a notable decline.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (KTVU) - The family of a teenage San Jose girl hit and critically injured by a VTA light rail train on Wednesday is asking for the public’s help determining how the accident happened.
Family members say Michelle Espinoza is an effervescent 14-year-old with an infectious personality. She remains at Valley Medical Center where she is fighting for her life.
“It’s hard. We can’t believe this happened. We wanna know how it happened,” said Liliana Rosas, the girl’s aunt.
Rosas and other family members sat outside the hospital Friday morning, trying to make sense of it all.
Espinoza clings to life in critical condition, with a fractured skull, swelling of the brain, broken ribs and clavicle, and other injuries.
Late Wednesday morning, Espinoza was riding her bike near Southwest Expressway and Stokes Street. She was hit by a VTA light rail train as it made its way through the intersection.
“All we know is that we’re thankful she’s alive and she’s fighting. She’s very strong,” said Eliana Espinoza, Michelle’s older sister.
San Jose police say the teen was riding her bike east on Stokes Street and went around the crossing barriers, which were functioning. She peddled across the tracks, but there’s no explanation as to how or why she was hit by the southbound train. VTA officials stress being situationally aware when near or using their system.
“Often times, you may not see or hear a bus coming. So it’s important you look both directions,"" said Holly Perez, a VTA spokeswoman. ""Remove the distractions like earbuds, and really follow the directional signs. Whether it’s lights, directional signs or crossing gates.""
After Espinoza was struck, family member say a Good Samaritan pulled her off the tracks and administered CPR.
In the family's search for answers to the accident, they want to personally thank the stranger who may have helped save a 14-year-old’s life.
“We would love for the person who helped her to come forward. And we would like to meet them, and thank them and just give them a big hug,” said Eliana Espinoza.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- Security video from Hapa's Brewery shows customers outside enjoying their beer when all of a sudden a vehicle collides with a VTA train. The car, a gold Buick Regal, is mangled, while the train runs off its rails.

""The corner of my eye just happen to see this dude turning right when the train came and hit him and for a half a second my brain didn't register what it was and then you heard the loudest sound you've ever heard,"" said witness Ryan Stern.

The train operator and the roughly 20 passengers on board suffered no serious injuries. Passenger Jose Zarate is recovering from a sore hand.

""It felt like a tin can just crunching. You see the walls coming down on you. You don't know what to expect you know? I didn't know if it was a bomb. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know it was a car until after,"" said Zarate.

The male driver of the Buick and his male passenger died at the scene. Witnesses say they may have been living out of their car. They say it was packed with possessions.

""We all went out to the car and the dude was barely breathing and people were telling him to stay with him but it's pretty hard to survive a wreck like that,"" said Stern.

San Jose Police say the crossing arms were down and functioning, but the man behind the wheel still tried to drive around them. Investigators say the Buick was going south while the Mountain View to Winchester VTA train was heading north.

""We're just encouraging everyone that safety is really everyone's job so whether you're a pedestrian, driving a vehicle or a bicyclist, we all need to exhibit caution with the crossing gates, signs and platforms,"" said VTA Spokesperson Holly Perez.

Currently, a bus bridge is transporting passengers between stations. Service disruptions will likely continue for the next day or so. VTA says passengers should check their website and Twitter feed for service updates.

 Danika, a freshman at Del Mar High School in San Jose, was hit while bicycling Friday around 7:35 a.m. near Stokes Street and Southwest Expressway on her way to a singing performance at her school, according to her cousin Jessica Williams.

 

 According to Williams, Danika was rushing to get to the performance on time when she was struck.

 

 Her family waited at a hospital for several hours before they were told Danika had suffered fatal injuries and lost too much blood in the accident, according to Williams.

 

 An online fundraising website has been set up to raise $10,000 to go toward funeral and memorial services.



 A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Willow Glen Funeral Home at 1039 Lincoln Ave. in San Jose. A reception will follow the service at the Fraternal Order of Eagles Hall across the street. 

 

 On Monday, a burial procession will begin at 10 a.m. at the Willow Glen Funeral Home and arrive around 11 a.m. at the Oak Hill Cemetery at 300 Curtner Ave. in San Jose.

 

 On the website, Williams wrote, ""The entire family is deeply saddened by the loss of our sweet dear Danika.""

 

 Danika leaves behind her parents and a brother who is in fifth grade.

 

 As of Thursday morning nearly $7,300 had been raised on the site.

 

 After the high school learned about the incident, additional grief counselors were made available to students and staff, Campbell Union High School District spokesman Michael Posey said.

 

 Support staff continues to be available for students and staff this week, he said.

 

 An informal vigil took place at the site of the crash Saturday night, which is near the school.

 

 A growing memorial with candles, teddy bears, and signs has gone on the side of the school near the train tracks in honor of Danika.

 

 Danika was hit by a northbound train on the Mountain View-Winchester line. There were 40 passengers on the train at the time of the accident, according to VTA officials.

While driver may face charges, friends remember the victim of
Monday night’s train accident
Morgan Hill – Friends and co-workers of 18-year-old Jackie Gamboa gathered at a wooden cross near the railroad tracks Tuesday at San Pedro Avenue to pray and remember the radiant young woman, killed when the truck she was riding in was struck by an oncoming commuter train Monday night.
“If I wish I could have loved anyone, it would have been her,” said Robert Brancato, who came to the site to pay his respects to his friend.
Those who loved the petite teen all painted the same picture of her: Sweet. Happy. Beautiful.
“She was such a sweet, sweet girl,” said Carlota Martinez who worked with Gamboa at Fox Racing. “A beautiful lady.”
After learning of the death of her co-worker, Martinez and others came to the cross to grieve.
“We saw her yesterday. It’s very hard for us. We come to pray for her,” she said. “This morning when we got to work we found out. We’ve been crying all day for her.”
Michelle Ramirez, human resources manager, said Friday that when the announcement was made in the company about Gamboa’s death, employees were told that counseling referrals would be available if needed.
Meanwhile, Morgan Hill police are investigating the accident, which left the driver of the pick up, Morgan Hill resident Nathan Schrock, 20, in critical condition. He regained consciousness Tuesday but remains in serious but stable condition, police said Friday.
According to friends, Gamboa and Schrock had been a couple for the past three years.

The complete investigation may take months, as police wait to speak with Schrock, who witnesses say drove through warning signals and around closed gates at the crossing. The couple’s GMC Sonoma was struck by a southbound commuter train, which Schrock apparently never saw coming, police said.
Now he may face vehicle manslaughter charges for apparently attempting to beat the train across the tracks, punishable by up to six years in prison.
The incidents leading up to the tragic accident began about 7pm as Schrock headed southbound on Railroad Avenue. When he got to Tennant Avenue he saw the railroad arms down for an oncoming northbound freight train, according to police.
Schrock and a truck in front of him both made U-turns and headed back north on Railroad, apparently in an attempt to beat the northbound train to the next intersection at San Pedro Avenue, police said.
When they arrived the gates were down, police said, and Schrock was behind the other truck at the crossing.
Witnesses told police that he apparently became impatient and drove around the pickup in front of him and around the railroad arms. The driver of the first pickup yelled for Schrock to stop. A second train heading southbound saw the pickup and tried to stop, but plowed through the truck, splitting it in half. The bed of the truck ended up 150 feet down the rails.
Gamboa was ejected from the truck and pronounced dead at the scene. Schrock suffered serious trauma to the head and a gash to the thigh. He was flown to Regional Medical Center in San Jose.
Police are waiting for toxicology and alcohol reports for Schrock, which may take several weeks.
“Obviously, he is a big part of the investigation, and we cannot interview him when he is medicated or in any kind of altered state of consciousness,” said Cmdr. Joe Sampson of the Morgan Hill Police Department. “This is very sad. Two young lives have really been destroyed. He will have to live forever with this.”
Once he is interviewed and test results are available, a full report will be given to the District Attorney’s office which will determine whether or not to press manslaughter charges. Passing through activated railroad warning signs is illegal.
The engineer is being provided with counseling services. Rail traffic was stopped until the train was released about 10pm.
“This is just an unfortunate and tragic error in judgment in the part of this young man,” Sampson said.
Family members consoled each other Tuesday and declined to speak with the reporters for South Valley Newspapers, saying that the matter was private.
“It’s a tragedy,” friends said as they gathered on the sidewalks of the Gamboa home. They erected a large wooden cross with pictures of the beautiful young woman at various stages of her young life. It was later placed at the San Pedro Avenue crossing.
News of Gamboa’s death caused staff members to break into tears at Mount Madonna Continuation High School, where she graduated last year.
Journalism teacher Marina Campos grew very close with Gamboa during her senior year.
“I want to give my condolences to the family,” she said clasping a tissue. “She was like a shining light … She was radiant … She was just that one student you just won’t forget. I won’t forget. You won’t forget her face, you just won’t forget her smile.”
Campos described a student eager to please her teachers, making sure she did the job right – a woman whose personality was bigger than her petite frame.
“The essence of her beauty was just the type of person she was,” Campos said. “I am just shocked. This is probably the second time in my career that I can really feel the pain – and it’s not easy. I feel very much for the family. I would tell her, ‘Jackie – I love you,’ And I meant it. I meant it every time.”
Gamboa worked in the front office with Mt. Madonna staff and was close to former Principal John Perales, who met frequently with her and her mother to work with her towards reaching her goal of graduating.
She spoke of one day attending junior college.
“Her boyfriend I know, was a big part of her life,” he said. “I just remember her passion for life. She just loved spending time with her family and friends. We spent a lot of time together dreaming and justifying why she was working so hard,” he said. “Nothing was impossible for Jackie. She could conquer the world tomorrow.”",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,7,PM,Unknown,Unknown,Santa Clara,CA,06,Morgan Hill,Railroad Avenue,D,GMC Sonoma,Unknown,2,3,Unknown,1,commuter train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Commuter Train,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Southbound,1,Gates,Gates,A,Dry,1,Both sides,2,No,3,Unknown,1,18,2,Jackie Gamboa,2,Unknown,1,Unknown,1,Unknown,7,Unknown,1,Nathan Schrock,1,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,2,Unknown,Unknown,No,No,"The accident involved a pick-up truck driven by Nathan Schrock, who attempted to beat a northbound train to the next intersection at San Pedro Avenue.

California Highway Patrol (CHP) officials stated that the crash occurred around 1:45 PM on Old Chittenden Road near Highway 129. A 63-year-old woman from Watsonville driving a white Honda Fit was traveling north on a private road close to Old Chittenden Road. Simultaneously, a train was heading west on the tracks just ahead of her vehicle.
For reasons yet to be determined, the car and the train collided. Fortunately, the driver sustained only minor injuries and was promptly taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance for medical evaluation and treatment. None of the passengers or crew members on the train were injured in the crash.
The CHP is actively investigating the cause of the accident. Preliminary assessments indicate that drugs and alcohol do not appear to be contributing factors.
Personal Injury Claims
Determining fault in a collision can hinge on various factors, and in California, partial liability can be assigned to multiple parties. Assisting in establishing legal liability is one of the key roles that a personal injury attorney can fulfill for victims recovering from a traffic accident.
Suppose it is determined that the actions of another contributed toward the injuries. In that case, victims may qualify to file a personal injury claim with the insurance provider of those responsible. Such a claim can offer compensation to help offset hospital expenses, burial costs, and the loss of income from taking time off work for recovery.

Pedestrian Killed in Suisun City Train Collision Near Main Street
A Suisun City train collision on the Capitol Corridor route caused significant service disruptions on the evening of May 7. According to the Amtrak train status map, train 540, heading toward Sacramento, was halted just east of the Suisun-Fairfield station due to a service disruption on the tracks when a pedestrian was struck and killed.
Passengers Switched to Alternative Following Suisun City Train Collision
Capitol Corridor spokespersons reported shortly before 7:30 p.m. that arrangements were being made for passengers on Train 540 to transfer to an alternative train in Suisun City. The disruption follows an ongoing investigation at the collision scene, and exact details remain unclear. The Suisun City Police Department confirmed they are investigating the incident involving the death and noted that they will provide more information as it becomes available.
Railway Negligence and Legal Responsibility
Railway companies must follow regulations and perform routine maintenance to ensure the safety of vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians who may cross their tracks. Failure to fulfill this responsibility can lead to a Suisun City train collision that results in property damage, severe injuries, or even fatalities. Instances of railway negligence can create grounds for holding railroad companies accountable in the event of a train collision with another vehicle.
- Safety: Railroads and their employees are responsible for adhering to all safety regulations when operating on the tracks. Taking safety precautions at railroad crossings is vital, and railroads can be held liable for any damages or injuries caused by employees who fail to follow these standards.
- Maintenance and Repair: Proper maintenance of tracks and crossings is essential to prevent accidents such as derailments and collisions. Rail companies may be held responsible for damages resulting from train collisions if they neglect to maintain their infrastructure.
- Train Collisions Involving Pedestrians and Vehicles: To ensure safety, it is crucial for railroads to properly maintain crossings and tracks, as well as for individuals to exercise caution when crossing railroad intersections to avoid a Suisun City train collision. Failure by the owner of the tracks and crossings to do so can result in liability for the railroad company in case of accidents or injuries.
Seeking Justice After a Fatal Train Accident
Losing a loved one in a train collision is a devastating experience, and it is crucial to seek legal assistance promptly to ensure accountability for the damages. Consulting with a personal injury attorney can provide valuable guidance and help protect your rights. To recover financial losses and secure compensation for the emotional and psychological impact, families may consider filing a wrongful death claim.

													THIS IS KCRA THREE NEWS AT NOON. THE CONCLAVE TO ELECT A NEW POPE IS UNDERWAY. WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE SECRET PROCESS? AS CARDINALS CAST THEIR VOTES FOR THE NEXT PONTIFF? REAL ID REGULATIONS HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE YET TO GET YOUR ID, AND HOW IT COULD IMPACT YOUR FUTURE TRAVEL PLANS. THE TRIAL AGAINST THE ACCUSED DAVIS STABBER CONTINUES. THE EMOTIONAL TESTIMONIES IN COURT. WE BEGIN AT NOON WITH THE PROCESS TO ELECT A NEW POPE. IT’S OFFICIALLY UNDERWAY AT THE VATICAN TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON. I’M LISA GONZALEZ. THANKS FOR JOINING US AT NOON. AND YOU CAN SEE CARDINALS FROM AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING THE NEXT PONTIFF. HERE THEY ARE. THIS WAS THE SCENE AS 133 CATHOLIC CARDINALS ENTERED THE SISTINE CHAPEL EARLIER TODAY TO BEGIN THE PAPAL CONCLAVE. JAY GRAY HAS MORE AS CARDINAL ELECTORS HAVE CLOSED THE DOORS AND HAVE TAKEN A VOW OF SECRECY. AS WE ALL AWAIT THE SMOKE SIGNALS OF THE CASTED VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON. THE DOORS TO THE SISTINE CHAPEL CLOSED AND LOCKED. THE CONCLAVE HAS OFFICIALLY STARTED HERE. THE CARDINAL VOTERS MOVING INTO THE SISTINE CHAPEL, TAKING THEIR OATH OF SECRECY. AND THEN, AS THOSE DOORS ARE CLOSED, THEY WILL MEDITATE A BIT AND WE EXPECT THEM TO FILE THEIR FIRST BALLOTS TODAY TO TAKE THEIR FIRST VOTE. AFTER THAT IS DONE, WE WILL SEE THE SMOKE. MOST AGREE THAT THEY DON’T BELIEVE A CARDINAL WILL BE PICKED. TODAY. WE EXPECT TO SEE BLACK SMOKE FROM THAT CHIMNEY ATOP THE SISTINE CHAPEL. BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BEGINNING TO THIS CONCLAVE. IT’S ONE WHERE THEY WILL GET A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHO MAY HAVE THE MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW, MOVING INTO ALL OF THIS. AND THIS WILL REALLY FRAME WHAT HAPPENS MOVING FORWARD HERE. THE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE. IF THERE’S NO POPE TOMORROW, TWO VOTES IN THE MORNING, TWO VOTES IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THE WAITING AND WATCHING FOR THAT SMOKE IS ALL THAT’S LEFT. THAT’S THE VERY LATEST RIGHT NOW FROM HERE AT THE VATICAN. I’M JAY GRAY, NBC NEWS, AND WE ARE STANDING BY TO GO TO AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THESE LIVE PICTURES, BLACK SMOKE COMING FROM THE CHIMNEY. THIS IS AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT. HERE’S LESTER HOLT. GOOD EVENING FROM ROME. AS WE LOOK AT THE SISTINE CHAPEL, WE SEE BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING FROM THE CHIMNEY. THIS MEANS THE CARDINALS GATHERED FOR THE CONCLAVE HAVE NOT DECIDED ON A NEW POPE. IN THEIR FIRST BALLOT. THIS MEANS THE CONCLAVE WILL CONTINUE INTO AT LEAST TOMORROW, BEFORE THE WORLD KNOWS WHO THE NEXT LEADER OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL BE. LET ME BRING IN NOW, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT ANNE THOMPSON AND OUR SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST, GEORGE WEIGEL. AND ANNE, LET ME START WITH YOU. NOT UNEXPECTED. NO. THREE HOURS AND 16 MINUTES. I BELIEVE YOU CLOCKED THIS AT SINCE THE DOORS CLOSED IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL. 133 ELECTORS, THE LARGEST NUMBER THEY’VE EVER HAD. SO WE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE LONG. IT WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. BENEDICT’S THE FIRST VOTE, AND BENEDICT’S CONCLAVE WENT TO 805. THIS WAS A LOT LONGER, GEORGE. IT WAS A LOT LONGER, BUT I DON’T THINK IT WILL BE QUITE THIS LONG TOMORROW. THERE WON’T BE A SERMON BEFORE THEY START VOTING. THERE WILL BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL MOVE AT A SLIGHTLY LESS THAN STATELY PACE TOMORROW. LET ME GO TO OUR CORRESPONDENT, MOLLY HUNTER. SHE’S WITH THE CROWD ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE. THE VATICAN HAS BEEN GREAT ANTICIPATION. THOUSANDS OF CROWDED INTO SAINT PETER’S SQUARE. TELL US THE SCENE. WHEN WHEN THAT SMOKE WAS APPARENTLY BLACK, I LASSEN. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU. THE CROWDS ARE NOW STREAMING OUT OF THIS AREA. THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND SO MUCH ANTICIPATION FOR THE LAST THREE HOURS. AND I GOT TO SAY, EVERY TIME THERE WAS KIND OF A GASP OR A CLAP, EVERYONE WOULD GET THEIR PHONES UP AND POINT IT TOWARDS THE CHIMNEY. I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO ELIZABETH AND RANDY GIRLS. YOU’VE BEEN OUT HERE NOW FOR MORE THAN THREE HOURS. WHAT WAS THAT MOMENT LIKE TO SEE THAT BLACK SMOKE COMING OUT? IT WAS, I MEAN, KIND OF CRAZY. IT WAS. YEAH, IT WAS A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE. WE’VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THIS BEFORE, SO IT’S JUST BEEN AWESOME TO GET TO FINALLY HAVE THAT MOMENT OF RELIEF. AND ALSO HISTORICAL, HISTORICAL MOMENT FOR US. SO YOU GUYS ARE ALSO LUCKY YOU’RE IN TOWN FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. SO YOU THINK YOU THINK YOU ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE A NEW POPE COME IN? YEAH, YEAH. WE’RE HOPEFUL. VERY HOPEFUL. SO SEEING THE BLACK SMOKE IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING RIGHT NOW. BUT JUST BECAUSE WE’RE READY AND EXCITED TO SEE WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU, YOU’LL BE BACK IN THE MORNING. YEAH. YES. SO I’LL LET’S LOOK AT THE CROWDS JUST STREAMING OUT RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO FOR THE LAST THREE HOURS, STANDING OUT HERE WILL BE BACK TOMORROW. THEY WILL REMAIN ON SMOKE WATCH AND EVERYONE IS IS ECHOING THAT HOPEFUL IS WHAT WE’RE HEARING TONIGHT. MOLLY THANKS VERY MUCH. REMARKABLE SCENE THERE AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THE BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING FROM THE CHIMNEY. THERE WAS NO MISTAKING IT. AND PAST CONCLAVES THERE WERE A FEW QUESTIONS OF WHAT WE WERE SEEING, BUT VERY CLEARLY BLACK SMOKE, MEANING THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO FOR THE CARDINAL ELECTORS AS THEY RETURN TO VOTING TOMORROW. AND THOMPSON, YOU WERE WITH ME. A LOT OF FOLKS WILL PROBABLY TRY TO READ A LOT INTO THE THE LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY WERE WORKING ESSENTIALLY ON JUST ONE VOTE, RIGHT? WELL, PART OF IT IS THEY HAVE TO GET USED TO IT. I MEAN, THEY PHYSICALLY THEY HAVE TO WRITE THE NAME OF THEIR CANDIDATE AND THEN WALK THE BALLOT UP AND THEN SWEAR AN OATH AND PUT IT IN THE URN. SO THERE’S SOME OF THAT, BUT I DON’T THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE ANYTHING FROM THIS. IT’S JUST THE FIRST VOTE, AND IT’S A BIT OF A BEAUTY PAGEANT. IS THAT. AND IT’S A IT’S A FIRST VOTE THAT WAS PRECEDED BY WHAT I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY ASSUME WAS A FAIRLY LONG SERMON FROM THE FORMER PREACHER TO THE PAPAL HOUSEHOLD. CARDINAL CANTALAMESSA. I WOULDN’T READ MUCH OF ANYTHING INTO THIS EXCEPT THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR 133, OFTEN ELDERLY MEN, TO TO WALK UP AND CAST A BALLOT A LITTLE BIT SHORTER TOMORROW, I THINK. SO NOW THAT THE VOTING IS OVER FOR TODAY, WHAT IS LIKELY HAPPENING, I PRESUME THEY’LL HAVE A MEAL. DO THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE CANDIDATES AT THIS POINT. SO THEY’LL THEY’LL GO BACK TO THE CASTLE OF SANTA MARTA FOR DINNER. THOSE TABLES USUALLY ORGANIZE THEMSELVES BY NATIONAL GROUP OR LANGUAGE GROUP. I’M SURE THERE’LL BE SOME DISCUSSION OF OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY. OF COURSE, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE VOTING PATTERN WAS TODAY. THEY’RE OFTEN COMPLIMENTARY VOTES CAST ON THE FIRST BALLOT IN A CONCLAVE. TO SOMEONE WHO’S SUFFERED GREATLY FOR THE CHURCH, SOMEONE WHO SERVED THE CHURCH A LONG TIME. THE REAL INDICATOR AS TO WHERE THE ELECTORAL LANDSCAPE LIES, HOW IT LIES WILL COME. IN THOSE FIRST TWO BALLOTS. TOMORROW MORNING AND AND THE THE BURNING. OF COURSE, NOT ONLY SIGNIFYING THAT THERE IS NOT A POPE, BUT ALSO WE KNOW THE BALLOTS THEMSELVES ARE BURNED RIGHT BEFORE THEY ARE BURNED. IS EVERYONE IN THE ROOM? IS YOU UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE AT THAT POINT? THEY DO. THERE ARE THREE CARDINALS WHO COUNT THE BALLOTS. THEY’RE CALLED SCRUTINEERS. AND THE THIRD ONE ANNOUNCES THE WHO THE VOTE IS FOR AND KEEPS THE SCORECARD. AND THEN THERE ARE THREE OTHER CARDINALS THAT VERIFY THE COUNT TO MAKE SURE IT’S RIGHT. SO THOSE CARDINALS IN THE ROOM HAVE A VERY GOOD IDEA OF WHO GOT THE MOST BALLOTS ON THE FIRST VOTE. AND NOW I THINK WHAT HAPPENS OVER DINNER AND AT BREAKFAST TOMORROW IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE THE VOTES ARE GOING TO GO IN THE SECOND BALLOT, WHO’S GOT WHO’S GOT MOMENTUM OR WHERE THE MOMENTUM COULD BE. YEAH. AND GEORGE, WHAT I KNOW THIS IS A SECRETIVE PROCESS. SO WE ONLY HAVE SO MUCH INSIGHT INTO THAT. BUT HOW WOULD THAT HOW WOULD THAT LIKELY GO. THE GENERAL PATTERN LESTER LESTER IS THAT IF YOU CAN GROW YOUR VOTE TOTAL, YOU’RE IN GOOD SHAPE. IF YOU PEAK AT A CERTAIN POINT, FLATTEN OUT, YOUR CANDIDACY IS MOST PROBABLY OVER. BUT IN A SUPERMAJORITY VOTING SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHERE YOU NEED TWO THIRDS TO WIN. A STRONG MINORITY OF 45 CAN REALLY DRIVE THE DECISION MAKING IN A WAY THAT’S NOT THE CASE WHEN YOU HAVE A MAJORITY VOTING PROCESS. ONE OTHER THING TO ADD TO WHAT ANNE JUST SAID, INDIVIDUAL CARDINALS ARE KEEPING THEIR OWN SCORECARDS. NOW. THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THOSE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY THEY LEAVE, BUT YEAH. NO, I THINK TOMORROW MORNING THEY’LL HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE CORRELATION OF FORCES, IF I MAY SAY SO. LIKE THAT IS. ALL RIGHT. LET ME GO BACK TO SAINT PETER’S SQUARE. MOLLY IS STANDING BY THERE WITH THE CROWDS. THOUSANDS WHO PACKED IN FOR A VIEW OF A LARGE JUMBOTRON THERE IN FRONT OF THE BASILICA, SHOWING FOCUS ON THAT CHIMNEY. MOLLY. LESTER. VATICAN NEWS TELLS US THAT ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE WERE HERE. I’VE GOT TO SAY, AFTER THAT NEWS CAME OUT, IT LOOKED LIKE PEOPLE WERE STILL STREAMING IN. SO NOW YOU CAN SEE EVERYONE’S LEAVING. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PACKED. AND BEING HERE JUST ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, WITH ABOUT 250,000 PEOPLE, THERE WAS STILL ROOM TO MOVE AROUND AND THERE WAS A LOT OF JOY. EVERYONE WAS VERY RESPECTFUL TONIGHT. AND AGAIN, WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS EARLIER, LESTER. BUT THIS KIND OF COMMUNAL ATMOSPHERE, THOUGH, FOR TOURISTS WHO WERE JUST CURIOUS, WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON VACATION FOR PEOPLE THAT FLEW DIRECTLY OVER FOR THIS, FOR PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE IN ROME WHO KIND OF HEARD EARLIER THE ANNOUNCEMENTS, HEARD THE SINGING COMING OUT FROM THESE JUMBOTRONS AND WERE CALLED TO THE SQUARE. IT WAS THIS UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE TO BE OUT HERE, VERY DIVERSE, LOTS OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, LOTS OF DIFFERENT FLAGS THAT WE STARTED TO SEE. LESTER. AND WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYES OUT, OF COURSE, FOR LITTLE POCKETS, KIND OF NATIONAL POCKETS POPPING UP WITH FLAGS. PEOPLE WERE CHANTING. THE OTHER THING WE NOTICED TONIGHT IS THAT OCCASIONALLY SOMEONE WOULD GET EXCITED SOMEWHERE IN THE CROWD, AND SOME APPLAUSE WOULD BREAK OUT, OR SOMEONE WOULD POINT AT THE CHIMNEY OR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIMNEY, AND IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN A BIRD, BUT PEOPLE WERE GETTING JUMPY BY THE KIND OF THREE HOUR MARK. LESTER. YEAH, WAITING. I THINK WE WERE ALL A BIT CURIOUS AS TO WHAT’S TAKING THEM SO LONG. WE’LL PROBABLY NEVER HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, BUT I THINK IT WAS WIDELY SHARED AROUND HERE, ESPECIALLY AS THE EVENING GROWS COOL AND A LITTLE LESS COMFORTABLE TODAY. MOLLY, THANKS VERY MUCH. AND AND AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO TOMORROW, REMIND US HOW THIS WORKS, THEY’LL TAKE A TOTAL OF FOUR VOTES TOMORROW. THERE’LL BE TWO BALLOTS IN THE MORNING. AND IF THERE IS NO POPE ELECTED ON THE FIRST BALLOT IN THE MORNING, THEY WON’T BURN THAT UNTIL THE SECOND BALLOT HAPPENS. AND THEN THEY’LL BURN BOTH OF THOSE TOGETHER. AND THEN THE SAME PROCESS HAPPENS IN THE AFTERNOON. AND THEN IF WE GET TO SUNDAY AND THERE IS NO ONE SELECTED. THINGS. THERE’S A PAUSE. THERE’S A DAY OFF FROM VOTING. THE SENIOR CARDINAL DEACON, WHO’S CARDINAL DOMINIQUE MAMBERTI, WOULD GIVE AND WOULD ADDRESS THE WHOLE GROUP. THERE WOULD BE A WHOLE DAY FOR PEOPLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, AND THEN THEY’D PICK UP THE VOTING AGAIN ON MONDAY. BUT WE HAVEN’T GOTTEN THERE IN PREVIOUS NO REASON. NO. AND I, I THINK IT WOULD BE EXCEPTIONAL IF WE GOT THERE THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR WAITING IT OUT WITH US HERE AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH. SO THAT CONCLUDES THIS NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS PAPAL CONCLAVE. WE’LL HAVE MUCH MORE AHEAD ON OUR STREAMING NETWORK, NBC NEWS, NOW ONLINE AT NBC NEWS.COM. AND A FULL WRAP UP TONIGHT ON NBC NIGHTLY NEWS. I’M LESTER HOLT IN ROME. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AND GOOD DAY. AND THAT WAS AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT. ONE LAST LIVE LOOK, VATICAN CITY, AND YOU CAN SEE SAINT PETER’S SQUARE THERE. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GATHERED WAITING TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE CHIMNEY. WE DID SEE BLACK SMOKE COMING FROM THE CHIMNEY. AND THAT SIGNALED A VOTE HAD BEEN MADE. NO POPE WAS ELECTED. THAT WAS ABOUT AFTER THREE HOURS OF WAITING. AND WHEN THE DECISION IS OFFICIALLY MADE, WE WILL KNOW THAT THE NEW POPE HAS BEEN SELECTED BECAUSE WE WILL SEE WHITE SMO

An Amtrak train collision occurred with a motor vehicle in Fairfield on April 26, resulting in one fatality and injuries. The accident happened at about 8:39 a.m. at the East Tabor and Railroad Avenues crossing. Authorities with the Fairfield Fire Department reported that the vehicle that was struck by the train initially hit another car, resulting in major damage.

Investigation Underway to Determine Cause of Train Collision

One person died in the collision, while several others suffered major to moderate injuries and were transported to trauma centers for treatment. The accident is being investigated to determine fault and how it occurred.

Negligent Railroads Can Cause Motor Vehicle Collisions

When operating on tracks, railroads are required to obey regulations and perform regular maintenance to protect vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians that may cross. Upon failing to do this, they may cause serious accidents that can damage property, cause injury and even result in death. Railway negligence can result in several ways of holding railroads responsible in a train crash with another vehicle:

Equipment defects: Railroads are responsible for ensuring their equipment, such as brakes, tracks, couplings and engines, are in proper working order. Railroads can be liable for train crashes caused by defective equipment if they fail to perform maintenance or use old, outdated machinery or parts.

Track maintenance resulting in negligence: Railroads are responsible for properly maintaining tracks to ensure they are free of debris or other hazards that might cause an oncoming train to collide. In addition, worn tracks can lead to a train collision or derailment, so maintenance and repair are especially important. Rail companies can be held liable for damages resulting from train-vehicle collisions if they fail to maintain their tracks and crossings properly.

Safety: Taking safety precautions when passing through railroad crossings and following all safety regulations is the responsibility of railroads and their employees when operating on the tracks. Railroads are liable for damages or injuries caused by employees who fail to do so.

Wrongful Death Claims After a Train Accident

In the event of the death of a loved one in a train collision, you should seek legal help as soon as possible so everyone is held accountable for the damages. Your case can be evaluated by a personal injury attorney who will fight for your rights. To recover financial losses and receive compensation for emotional and psychological trauma, the family may wish to file a wrongful death claim.

If an accident attorney determines that negligence by the railway company or others was the cause of death, the family of a deceased loved one can file a wrongful death claim. A person or entity must be proven to have caused the untimely death through negligence. It is possible for the estate administrator or members of the immediate family to file a claim. However, only one claim may be filed. If you would like more information, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

The collision occurred at about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday on a track owned by Union Pacific Railroad, and involved an Amtrak train on the Capitol Corridor service heading northeast from San Jose to Sacramento, according to Kelly Just, an Amtrak spokesperson.
Train 524 on the Capitol Corridor struck a vehicle that was obstructing the track, and that vehicle in turn struck a second vehicle, she said Friday. It was not immediately clear which vehicle Simi was in at the time of the collision.
Several other people were hospitalized after the crash with injuries ranging from major to moderate, CBS affiliate KOVR-TV of Sacramento reported.
No injuries were reported among the train crew or the estimated 120 passengers, according to Just.
The wreck occurred at East Tabor Road and Railroad Avenue, and caused closures of both roads that lasted several hours, police said in a news release. The Amtrak train was delayed by nearly three hours, Just said.
YOUNTVILLE — When the first Rock the Ride fundraiser to end gun violence was held last summer, the Napa Valley community was still reeling fro…
Simi rose to local prominence in the Napa Valley in the wake of Donald Trump’s 2016 election as president, which led her and three others to form Rise Up Napa in response to what they described as a rising threat of racism and intolerance.
“We have a president who doesn’t represent our beliefs,” she told the Napa Valley Register during a December 2016 march Rise Up Napa organized in downtown Napa against the then president-elect. “I realized complacency is no longer an option. We have to get off our couches and out of our houses and organize to stand up for what we believe. This is not politics as usual.”
Simi also was a member of the Napa chapters of the anti-gun-violence group Moms Demand Action, Indivisible and the Rock the Congress political action committee, according to Ermilita Bruce Gulliksen, a friend, neighbor and fellow Rise Up Napa co-founder.
A pair of attacks that killed Napa County residents — the March 2018 Pathway Home shooting in Yountville and a mass shooting that November in Thousand Oaks in which the Napa native Alaina Housley and 12 others died — moved Simi to urge quicker action against “the onslaught of gun violence … in our community and in our country,” she said during the Rock the Ride benefit in 2019 to fundraise for groups battling gun violence.
Lilea Heine, a former neighbor of Simi’s in Browns Valley and the executive director of First 5 Napa Valley, recalled the support Simi lent her and others involved in Rise Up Napa and Moms Demand Action.
“She was so comforting, reminding me of our work to shape the world we want for our kids and for our community,” said Heine, who first came to know Simi when both were serving as volunteer escorts for Planned Parenthood clinic visitors. “She was a great comfort during our time (together).” (Heine is a member of the Napa Valley Register’s editorial board.)
Later Thursday, Bruce Gulliksen reflected on the loss not only of a comrade-in-arms in political activism, but also of a neighbor and loyal friend.
“She was so personable. She would just know you from the first time you met her; she’d find something you had and find something to connect with you,” she said of Simi. “She was just beaming positivity; she was always a great relationship kind of a person.
“I’m still in shock,” said Bruce Gulliksen. “Everyone who knows her is still in shock. She was gone too soon. She had so much life to live.”
Simi leaves behind her husband, daughter and son, along with her parents and two sisters, according to Bruce Gulliksen.

SOLANO COUNTY – A fiery crash involving a vehicle and an Amtrak train has left one person dead near Vacaville early Thursday afternoon. The Vacaville Fire Protection District says they responded to the scene near California Pacific and Elmira roads just before 12:30 p.m. Crews found a vehicle fully engulfed after the crash. 
California Highway Patrol has since confirmed one person in the vehicle died; no one else was in the vehicle, officers say. The train crossing arms were down when the vehicle was hit. Due to the crash, train traffic on the Capitol Corridor is delayed. Train 532 is holding in Fairfield-Vacaville, Capitol Corridor says, while Train 543 is being delayed from departing Sacramento.Amtrak released a statement Thursday afternoon saying more than a hundred people were on board the train and they were investigating the incident with authorities.On January 19, Amtrak train 541 was traveling from Sacramento to San Jose at approx. 12:40 when a vehicle obstructing the track came into contact with the train in Elmira, CA with 106 passengers onboard. Amtrak is working with local law enforcement to investigate the incident. According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), trespassing along railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths in America, and railroad crossing incidents are the second leading cause of rail-related deaths in America. These incidents can affect everyone involved—those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers. They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and crossings. Amtrak continues to work closely with Operation Lifesaver (OLI) to #STOPTrackTragedies by emphasizing the obvious dangers of being on railroad property or disregarding warnings at rail crossings.

Josh Ludtke said. ""The train struck the rear driver’s-side of the vehicle as it crossed the tracks, spinning it around, and it came to rest on the northwest side of the intersection.""

It is more than a mental health condition — states and communities can adopt comprehensive strategies to prevent suicide.  By Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Deputies have identified a Northern California man killed on Sonoma County train tracks on Tuesday as a 68-year-old caretaker who was accused of sexually abusing disabled kids.Keith Marcum of Rohnert Park was struck by the SMART train south of Santa Rosa around 9:30 p.m., according to the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies said they are “investigating the incident as a suicide as the train video clearly shows the man laid on the tracks in front of the train moments before impact.” The death is the third in two weeks on the Sonoma and Marin County train line north of San Francisco, which opened two years ago, according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Marcum represented himself as a certified psychologist and ran an in-home care center for mentally and physically disabled children and adults in Rohnert Park for roughly 30 years, until he was arrested in April on charges of continuous child sexual abuse, sodomy, cruelty to a child and posession of child pornography, according to the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety.Police said Marcum’s arrest came after a former resident revealed a pattern of sexual and physical abuse that began 10 years ago. Two more victims came forward following Marcum’s arrest and said they were sexually abused by Marcum as well from ages 6 to 14, according to police. Police said there could be more victims.During a search of Marcum’s home on Brenda Way in Rohnert Park, detectives discovered more than 600 images of child porn, according to police.“Detectives called family members of the three residents who live there with Marcum to advise them of the investigation and assisted with getting them out of the house,” police said in April, adding that it was then unknown if those residents had been victims as well. Authorities booked Marcum at the Sonoma County jail, where he was held on $765,000 bail, police said. Marcum posted bail and was released, the Press Democrat reported. He was set to appear in court to face charges on July 23, according to KSRO.Sgt. Keith Astley said the investigation revealed Marcum’s clinical psychology bona fides were fraudulent, including claims that he had earned clinical psychology and neurophysiology doctorates, as well as education and cognitive psychology master’s degrees, according to the Press Democrat.“We never found any documentation supporting those degrees Marcum claimed to have obtained,” Astley said, according to the newspaper.Court records said Marcum was arrested in 1981 on child sexual assault allegations in Colorado, but got a deferred four-year sentence, the Press Democrat reports.Marcum wrote a goodbye post on Facebook hours before his death, per the newspaper: “Farewell everyone — it’s been a wonderful life,” Marcum reportedly said.

SANTA ROSA, Calif. (KGO) -- It happens to every major railroad, and SMART train is not immune.

This morning, a female was struck and killed by a Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit train in Santa Rosa Wednesday morning, according to a Sonoma County fire and emergency dispatcher.

The collision was reported at 7:36 a.m. in Santa Rosa at Hearn Avenue near Whitewood Drive. SMART says everything in the intersection functioned normally---the lights, the traffic arms, the horn on the train and a video camera on board that captured everything.

The train hit the victim at full speed, about 79 miles an hour, and the the body came to rest roughly 50 yards down the track.

SMART service was suspended but begin after the crash investigation.

The eastbound lane is closed, and drivers can expect long delays in both directions.

This accident comes one day after The Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit District announced it received more funding from the state, an estimated $10.5 million. It will help increase service because of its popularity.

Mead Clark Lumber confirms that an employee went gone home for the day after seeing the train hit this morning's female victim. They say he tells them that she made no effort to get out of the train's way. @smarttrain #abc7now pic.twitter.com/QX4YJoufwL — Wayne Freedman (@WayneFreedman) January 31, 2018

SMART trains started rolling between Santa Rosa and San Rafael in August.

The trains have carried more than 300, 000 passengers since then, according to the district.

This may be the first fatality involving a SMART train.

A woman well known to many in the Simi Valley community died May 6 after she was struck by a Metrolink train in East Simi Valley, police said.

The victim, identified as 45-yearold

Arlene Stone, was homeless and frequently seen around the Simi Valley train station, according to residents. The Ventura County Medical Examiner’s Office determined she died of blunt head trauma. Her death was ruled an accident.

Simi Valley police said they were notified by Metrolink at 2:41 p.m. that one of its trains had struck a pedestrian along the tracks near the 5200 block of Katherine Street, behind a residential neighborhood near Katherine Elementary School.

Emergency crews from the Ventura County Fire Department responded and pronounced the woman dead at the scene.

The westbound Train 121 was en route from Chatsworth with approximately 35 passengers and crew when it hit Stone. No one aboard the train was injured.

Passengers were transferred to a bus while the train remained stopped for about three hours during the investigation.

Simi Valley Police Sgt. Rick Morton said it appeared the woman was standing too close to the tracks and may not have heard the train approaching until it was too late.

“It appears to be a tragic accident,” Morton said.

Following news of her death, many community members shared condolences online, recalling Stone’s familiar presence in the area.

(This story has been updated with new information from Oxnard police.)
One person was hospitalized with critical injuries Tuesday night after a train struck a semitrailer in Oxnard.
The crash, between a Metrolink train and the big rig, was reported around 7:15 p.m. at Fifth Street and Rice Avenue, according to initial reports.
Battalion Chief John Ceceña, with the Oxnard Fire Department, said at 7:45 p.m. that crews assessed the truck driver and two bystanders — one working at a sidewalk vending location and a woman buying food from the vendor.
Authorities later said debris from the crash struck the patron. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital with a head injury, police officials said in a news release, and was said to be in critical but stable condition Tuesday night.
The food vendor and truck driver refused additional care, Ceceña said.
Of the 13 passengers on the Metrolink train, two complained of pain, authorities said.
The semi had been stopped on southbound Rice when it was hit, Oxnard Police Department officials said in a release. The westbound train hit the rig's trailer.
The Metrolink train started at Los Angeles' Union Station at 5:30 p.m. It had been scheduled to arrive in Oxnard at 7:07 p.m., according to its social media and website.
Oxnard Police Cmdr. Kevin Baysinger said officers also assisted at the scene with the injured.
Because of the crash, both train and vehicle traffic in the immediate vicinity was stopped. Fifth Steet between Rose Avenue and Del Norte Boulevard was closed as were portions of Rice Avenue between Eastman Avenue and East Wooley Road, he said.
The commander said officers were investigating the collision. Alcohol didn't appear to be a factor, department officials later said.
Tuesday's crash happened at a deadly crossing where federal, state and city officials broke ground last month on a major project to build a bridge overpass.
The $134.5 million grade separation project at Rice Avenue and Fifth Street will add up to six lanes to carry vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians over the railroad tracks.
On Feb. 24, 2015, the crossing was the scene of a fatal crash between another Metrolink train and a utility truck that got stuck on the tracks.
Anyone with information about Tuesday's collision is asked to contact traffic coordinator Cpl. Manuel Perez at 805-385-7750 or at manuel.perez@oxnardpd.org.

A Metrolink train and tractor-trailer collided at Rice Avenue and Fifth Street in Oxnard, causing one woman to be hospitalized at about 7:15 p.m. on March 25.
According to the Oxnard Police Department, the train, carrying 13 passengers, struck the trailer of a tractor-trailer as the train crossed Rice Avenue at Fifth Street. The tractor-trailer had been stopped on southbound Rice Avenue and the train was traveling westbound.
Debris from the collision struck a woman at a nearby taco stand. She was transported to a local hospital with a head injury, and was listed in critical but stable condition, according to the Oxnard Police Department.
Two passengers on the train complained of pain, and the driver of the tractor-trailer was not injured.
Alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the collision, according to the Oxnard Police Department's written statement. Traffic investigators also responded to the scene and assisted with the investigation.
The site is the same location where, in 2015, a fatal crash occurred between another Metrolink train and a utility truck that got stuck on the tracks.
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted in July to crack down on sidewalk vending throughout the county, which includes pop-up taco vendors on Rice Avenue.
The 20-month pilot program, costing $1.7 million, was intended to enhance roadside and traffic safety, according to Code Compliance Director Doug Leeper, who provided the supervisors with a presentation, including a video of a vehicle crashing into a food stand also in Oxnard from March 2024.
""It is an issue of safety,"" Leeper said at the July meeting. ""Not just food-borne illness safety and food handling safety, but of personal safety as these folks stop, get out, walk along the roadway, stand and eat in some of these locations.""
Rice Avenue was mentioned specifically during the meeting as the county location with the most vendors observed during the survey, also noting that none of the vending locations observed would be permittable under the ordinance.
Enforcement of the code began in November, with the hiring of a full-time senior code compliance officer, with an annual salary of between $85,068 and $119,302. Enforcement also required the staffing of a senior code compliance officer, a code compliance officer, and a technician, as well as funding for an extra-duty assignment for two senior deputies with the Sheriff’s Office.
For 2025-26, the 12-month pilot program was estimated to require $957,200.
Enforcement was intended to help respond to complaints, make proactive contact with vendors, investigate situations, issue citations and impound equipment and merchandise if it was deemed they presented a safety hazard.
Anyone with more information on the collision is encouraged to contact Corporal Manuel Perez, Oxnard Police Department traffic coordinator, at 805-385-7750 or via email at:manuel.perez@oxnardpd.org.

At least one person died when a Metrolink train collided with a vehicle just south of Camarillo Monday afternoon.
The California Highway Patrol responded to the crash shortly after 2 p.m. near the intersection of Fifth Street and Las Posas Road, according to initial reports. CHP's incident page lists the collision as fatal.
The man driving the SUV died at the scene, the CHP said in a news release.
A preliminary investigation indicated the man had been traveling southbound on Las Posas Road and stopped on the railroad tracks for a red light at Fifth Street. When the train approached the crossing arms and signals activated.
The SUV was still on the tracks when the train entered the crossing and struck the vehicle.
The crash, between a Metrolink train and a Lincoln SUV, at the rail crossing is the second in less than a week. On Tuesday, a train struck a tractor-trailer at Fifth Street and Rice Avenue, injuring one person who was a bystander.
Monday's crash caused closures of Los Posas Road between Fifth Street, also known as State Route 34, and Pleasant Valley Road. The force of the crash tore through the vehicle and wrapped the crossing arm around the traffic signal.
Metrolink train 118 was carrying five passengers and two crew members, said Jeanette Flores, assistant director of public affairs for Metrolink. The train, headed to Los Angeles' Union Station, was stopped after the incident, she said.
No one was injured on the train, according to the Ventura County Fire Department, which responded to the incident.
CHP said the crash is still being investigated. Anyone with additional information about the crash is asked to call the Ventura-area CHP office at 805-662-2640.

A 63-year-old woman died Tuesday after an Amtrak train struck her vehicle in Camarillo.
The incident was reported just after 10:35 a.m. at the railroad crossing near the intersection of Upland and Somis roads.
An Amtrak Surfliner headed northbound crashed into a four-door passenger vehicle with one female occupant, the Ventura County Fire Department said.
A woman was shot and injured at her home on Encino Avenue on New Year’s Eve by an ACS Security guard who was patrolling alone.
The vehicle had been traveling west on Upland Road when it stopped on the railroad tracks, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Tuesday.
The engineer saw the vehicle and applied the emergency brakes but was not able to stop the train.
The locomotive struck the vehicle, pushing it into the crossing arm control box, authorities said.
The woman was pulled from the vehicle in critical condition and flown by helicopter to a trauma center, where she later died. Her name has not been released.
Video posted to X, formerly Twitter, by the Fire Department showed the crumpled remains of the vehicle lying near the stopped train.
The collision did not cause the train to derail, and no injuries were reported on board. The crash remains under investigation.

A woman died after her car was struck by an Amtrak passenger train around 11 a.m. Tuesday in Camarillo.
Ventura County firefighters responded to the scene at the intersection of Lewis and Las roads, where Amtrak’s Surfliner 765 was headed north and struck a white passenger car in the intersection.
The motorist, identified as Carole Schlesinger, 63, was heading west on Upland Road alone and, for unknown reasons, stopped on the tracks. The train engineer noticed the vehicle and applied emergency braking in an attempt to halt the train, according to Ventura County Sheriff’s Deputy Luke Riordan.
The collision pushed the Toyota Yaris into the signal box that controls the railroad crossing arms.
The driver was cut from the vehicle by firefighters and airlifted by helicopter to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in critical condition.
She later succumbed to her injuries.
No injuries were reported on the train.
Lewis, Las Posas, and Upland roads were reopened about an hour after the collision, according to firefighter Andy VanSciver.

The collision remains under investigation by the Camarillo Police Department Traffic Bureau. Anyone who may have witnessed the incident is asked to contact Riordan at (805) 388-5100.

A woman died Tuesday after her car stopped at a railroad crossing and was hit by an Amtrak train.

The crash happened around 10:40 a.m. at a crossing located at North Lewis Road and Upland Road.

According to the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office, a 63-year-old woman was driving her vehicle west on Upland Road. For reasons that are under investigation, the woman stopped the vehicle on the tracks.

The Amtrak Pacific Surfliner train had just entered city limits headed southbound and the conductor immediately applied the emergency brake once recognizing there was a vehicle on the tracks.

Despite the emergency braking, the train crashed into the side of the stationary vehicle, pushing it into the signal control box that controls the railroad arms.

Debris from inside the woman’s car could be seen tossed about the crash site.

Fire crews extricated the woman from the mangled vehicle and she was flown by helicopter to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries.

No injuries were reported on the train, which did not derail, the Ventura County Fire Department said.

Around 5 p.m. Tuesday evening, the Sheriff’s Office confirmed that the woman was killed in the crash. She’s been identified only as a 63-year-old transient woman.

The tracks were closed between Moorpark and Camarillo due to the incident and traffic on both Amtrak and Metrolink was affected by the closure.

Officials say traffic signals at the intersection will be flashing red through Wednesday and possibly later.

The Sheriff’s Office is urging drivers to remember the rules of the road when approaching a railroad crossing: if red lights are flashing, you are required to stop, even if the crossing arms aren’t down yet. You should never, under any circumstances, stop your vehicle on railroad tracks.

This deadly collision is under investigation by the Camarillo Police Department Traffic Bureau and any witnesses are urged to contact Deputy Luke Riordan at 805-388-5100.",Amtrak,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,10,AM,Unknown,Unknown,Ventura,CA,06,Camarillo,North Lewis Road and Upland Road,A,Auto,Unknown,4,1,Stalled or stuck on crossing,1,Amtrak Pacific Surfliner train,Public,A,Unknown,2,Unknown,4,Unknown,4,Unknown,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Passenger Train-Pulling,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2,Southbound,5,Hyw. traffic signals,Traffic signals at the intersection will be flashing red,A,Dry,1,Both sides,1,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,1,63,2,Female,2,No,4,Stopped on crossing,3,Unknown,7,Unknown,1,63-year-old woman,1,0,1,1,Unknown,1,0,Unknown,Yes,Unknown,0,Unknown,Unknown,"A woman died after her car stopped at a railroad crossing and was hit by an Amtrak train.

At least five people were taken to the hospital after a collision between an Amtrak train and a semi-truck in Ventura County Tuesday evening that blocked traffic and led to the suspension of train service overnight.

The collision occurred in Somis, an unincorporated area of Ventura County, at around 6:20 p.m. on State Route 118 at Sand Canyon Road, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter, by the California Highway Patrol.

Video of the crash scene obtained by KTLA showed a large response by Ventura County Firefighters who responded to the scene to help passengers safely off the train and triage those injured.

Fire officials said five people were taken to local hospitals with minor to moderate injuries.

Investigators said the big rig got stuck on the tracks because of the incline. The driver was able to safely get out of the truck before it was struck by Amtrak’s Pacific Sufrliner, which was headed south to Los Angeles with 95 passengers and five crew members.

Shortly after the crash, Amtrak announced the suspension of the Pacific Surfliner service between Moorpark and Camarillo through Wednesday morning. Commuters were urged to call 800-USA-Rail for reservation assistance.

CHP said that State Route 118 between Balcom Canyon Road and State Route 34 (Somis Road) was expected to be completely closed through the early morning hours so crews could remove the semi-truck and make roadway repairs.

“The last train car is back on the tracks and rolling back to the yard. SR-118 is fully REOPENED just in time for your morning commute,” a tweet from the CHP read.

MOORPARK, Calif. (KABC) -- New details emerged Thursday as the investigation continued into the cause of a derailment that occurred after a passenger train struck a water truck in Moorpark.

The driver of the truck was a Ventura County Public Works Agency employee who was providing dust control to nearby workers at the time of the collision on Wednesday morning, according to investigators. The crew was cleaning up a debris basin.

Why the vehicle was in the path of the train, which had about 200 people onboard, remained unclear.

The crash occurred shortly before 11:30 near Los Angeles Avenue and Gabbert Road. Several of the train cars were dislodged from the tracks but all of them remained upright.

Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday night after an Amtrak train was derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

On Thursday afternoon, crews were seen installing new tracks at the crash site as train service remained suspended.

Oxnard resident Ricky Williams, who commutes to downtown Los Angeles, said the trip usually takes him an hour and 40 minutes on the train. On Thursday he was forced to drive to the Moorpark station, which lengthened his commute to more than two hours.

""For me, it's not frustrating at all because I've been doing this for over 10 years,"" Williams said.

No estimate has been given by Amtrak of when train service will resume at the location.

""There were approximately 198 passengers and 13 crew onboard who were evacuated from the train, with no reports of serious injuries,"" Amtrak said in a statement. ""The train derailed as a result of the impact but remained upright. Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements. Amtrak, in coordination with local authorities, is conducting a full investigation. ""

""Suddenly, it flies forward,"" a passenger told NBCLA. ""I felt a little bit of shaking. Really violent. I thought we were going off the rails. Then it stopped.""

Mindy Faver was seated facing the rear of the train after a trip with her mother, Shari Peterson.

“All of a sudden: Smack!” Faver said, describing the impact.

Then Faver saw what she later found out was the water truck’s tank tumbling past her window.

MOORPARK, Calif. (AP) — An Amtrak train carrying nearly 200 passengers struck a county water truck and derailed on Wednesday in Southern California, critically injuring the truck’s driver, authorities said.
Three of the train’s seven cars went off the tracks following the collision in Moorpark, said Ventura County Fire Department Captain Brian McGrath. The derailed train cars remained upright on tracks adjacent to an orchard and bare sections of land.
Fourteen people on the train were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, while the truck driver was taken to a trauma center with a head injury, McGrath said.
Parts of the demolished Ventura County Public Works truck were scattered all around the derailed train cars. McGrath initially said the truck’s driver was believed to have gotten out of the vehicle before the crash, but later clarified that the circumstances leading up to the wreck weren’t known.
“No one’s talked to him, so the whole situation is still being investigated,” he said.
Mindy Faver was seated facing the rear of the train after a trip with her mother, Shari Peterson, returning from visiting family in Oregon.
“All of a sudden: Smack!” Faver said, describing the impact. Then Faver saw what she later found out was the water truck’s tank tumbling past her window.
Most of the passengers were able to get off the train cars on their own or with the aid of first responders, McGrath said. TV news helicopters showed numerous people, many carrying luggage, milling about in a field as firefighters worked the scene.
“It could have been a lot worse,” Faver told the Ventura County Star.
The train was on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle when “it struck a water truck obstructing the tracks” at 11:15 a.m., Amtrak said in a statement.
“There were approximately 198 passengers and 13 crew onboard who were evacuated from the train, with no reports of serious injuries,” the statement said. “Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements. Amtrak, in coordination with local authorities, is conducting a full investigation.”
Crews were able to quickly douse a small fire, McGrath said.

Sixteen people were hospitalized Wednesday after an Amtrak train struck a public works truck and slid off the tracks in the city of Moorpark, Calif. The 10-car Amtrak Coast Starlight passenger train was traveling northbound, from Los Angeles towards Seattle, when it struck the truck around 11:15 a.m. PT, officials said.  The train was carrying a total of 186 passengers and 13 crew members, none whom required extrication to exit the train, according to the Ventura County Fire Department's Public Information Officer. Amtrak put the passenger count higher, at 198. The truck's driver, a public works employee, was taken to a trauma center. 
Statements from several local agencies characterized the passenger injuries as mostly minor, though some told reporters it was a scary and painful incident.  ""I thought we were goners,"" passenger Theresa Darragh told the Ventura County Star.  Kimberly Mathews, who was traveling in the same car as Darragh, described to the outlet how she'd been left with shoulder and back pain after hitting the stairs during the crash.  ""It feels like somebody took a sledgehammer and just whacked me 50 times,"" she said.  The crash's impact caused three of the train's seven passenger cars to derail, but they stayed upright. Smoke poured out from the train's luggage car, but the fire was extinguished quickly, the fire department said.  Amtrak did not immediately return NPR's request for more information. 
The impacted vehicle, a Ventura County Public Works tanker truck, was atop a level-grade crossing as its employees were cleaning out a channel nearby, the The Star reported. Ventura County Sherriff's Capt. Dean Worthy described the site to the outlet as ""a remote farm road."" The crossing has a stop sign, but no electronic crossing arms, photos show.

MOORPARK, Calif. (KABC) -- Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday evening after an Amtrak train derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

Officials said a total of 16 people were injured, including the driver of the water truck, but there were no serious injuries. If train cars had actually toppled over completely, officials believe there would have been a lot more people injured.

""We're very lucky today that the trains stayed on the wheels,"" said Andy Vansciver of Ventura County Fire. ""Obviously, it was derailed but it stayed vertical. I think that really limited the amount of injuries we had.""

AIR7 HD was above the scene and captured the train with several of its cars off the tracks.

People could also be seen on ambulance stretchers. One couple was headed to the hospital after one of them suffered an arm injury.

The train was traveling westbound and filled with more than 200 people at the time at the crash. Some of the passengers spoke with Eyewitness News about the ordeal.

""Yeah, I was listening to an audio tape when and I was laying back on the sofa, and all of a sudden, we hit very hard and things were flying around,"" said Debbie Welsford of Anaheim. ""Our luggage, my cup, the water ... everything was just flying around the room and we realized we hit something so we came out and looked and saw the water tank.""

""It was very brief. Felt the train make impact and, you know, flew me forward in the car,"" said Matthew Roberts of Paso Robles. ""Immediately got up to see if everyone around me was ok. The car filled with a lot of dust and it took about 30 seconds for the train to come to a stop and we assessed the situation, made sure everyone was ok, and got to the exit and that was it.""

Investigators and passengers are asking questions Wednesday night after an Amtrak train was derailed after colliding with a water truck obstructing the tracks in Moorpark.

The water truck was delivering water to local ranches in the rural area when it got in the way of the train. The driver was talking with police before being taken to the hospital. It's unclear why the water truck was in the train's way.

Officials were bussing the uninjured passengers to the Moorpark Senior Center where they could be reunited with loved ones. Amtrak worked with passengers to help them get to their final destination.

The train was set to stop in Oxnard on its way to Seattle.

The tracks themselves have been damaged due to the collision as well and it was unclear how people who use the line to and from work would be able to travel home Wednesday night.

Amtrak released the following statement on the crash:

""On June 28, 2023, Amtrak train 14 was traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle at approx. 11:15 a.m. PT when it struck a water truck obstructing the tracks at Moorpark, California. There were approximately 198 passengers and 13 crew onboard who were evacuated from the train, with no reports of serious injuries. The train derailed as a result of the impact but remained upright. Amtrak is working with customers to make alternate travel arrangements. Amtrak, in coordination with local authorities, is conducting a full investigation.""

- Share via
A woman who police say abandoned her car on railroad tracks in Ventura minutes before the vehicle was struck by a slow-moving Amtrak train has been booked on suspicion of drunk driving, according to police.
Arcelia Delgadillo had unintentionally driven onto the railroad tracks at Garden Street and Harbor Boulevard, where the vehicle became stuck, according to Ventura Police Cmdr. Tom Higgins. The 27-year-old Ventura resident and her passenger then exited the vehicle at about 7:38 p.m. and stood nearby.
About three minutes later, the train’s conductor spotted the vehicle on the tracks and tried to stop. But the train, which was traveling south at 15 to 20 mph, could not stop and plowed into the vehicle.
“When the train struck the vehicle, it possibly caused an electrical shortage which electrified the vehicle and railroad tracks,” Higgins said in a statement. “Due to the rain, this caused an extreme hazard to emergency personnel.”
The vehicle was wedged under the front of the train, which had 60 passengers on board. The passengers were not injured.
The train was delayed for two hours as crews worked to dislodge the vehicle and remove it from the tracks.
Police later arrested Delgadillo and booked her into a Ventura County jail, Higgins said.

The Oxnard rail crossing that was the scene of Tuesday’s Metrolink derailment is the 23rd most hazardous in California, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration.

In 2014, two people were killed when their vehicle was struck by an Amtrak train at the Rice Avenue crossing.

According to data from the U.S. agency, the crossing had two collisions in 2010 and one in 2009.

The data indicate the Rice Avenue crossing had more collisions than any other Ventura County crossing in the 2009-2013 period.

LIVE UPDATES: Oxnard Metrolink crash

The issue of rail crossing safety has been raised before.

In 2009, The Times performed a data analysis showing so-called grade-level street crossings used by Metrolink trains such as the Rice Avenue junction had a particularly high number of accidents or near-collisions.

STORY SO FAR: Metrolink derailment

Twelve locations accounted for about one in five crossing accidents, and of all accidents, nearly one in four were along a 17-mile corridor in the San Fernando Valley. The most dangerous intersection was Sunland Boulevard at San Fernando Road in Los Angeles, at which there were 13 incidents. Buena Vista Street in Burbank, with nine, had the second-worst record.

Officials have talked about making some of these crossings safer, in some cases with extra barriers. But building more grade separations has been a slow process because such projects are expensive.

OXNARD, Calif. (KABC) -- A 54-year-old truck driver from Yuma, Arizona was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run after a Metrolink train headed toward Los Angeles struck his large pickup truck, which was hauling a trailer, on the tracks in Oxnard Tuesday. No fatalities were reported, Oxnard police said.

Ventura County Line Train 102 crashed at about 5:40 a.m. near 5th Street and Rice Avenue. The vehicle caught fire after the crash.

Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez managed to flee the scene, Oxnard fire officials said. An officer spotted Ramirez walking on Rice Avenue about 1.62 miles south of the accident and determined that he was the driver.

""It appeared that he was very distressed. The person appeared to be disoriented and on the phone,"" Oxnard Assistant Police Chief Jason Benites said.

Ramirez was not injured, but was taken to Ventura County Medical Center for observation. He was arrested following his release from the hospital. He has a valid driver's license, police said.

Benites said the 2005 Ford-450 pickup truck appeared to be traveling southbound on 5th Street, and in attempting to make a right turn onto a street, instead turned onto railroad tracks and got stuck. It was unclear if the area was part of his regular route.

Upon impact, five cars derailed, including three seen on their side and two upright, fire officials said.

""The whole truck was just up in flames, or car, I didn't know what it was. It was a fireball,"" Ted Maloney said. He immediately went inside the train car to help passengers. Maloney found a sweater and wrapped it around the neck of a female victim, who was bleeding.

""I just held her hand and comforted her and told her help was on the way,"" Maloney said.

A total of 49 people were on the train, including 46 passengers and three crew members. Authorities say 28 people were taken to area hospitals, with four in critical condition. One of the four in critical condition was the train engineer. The conductor and his assistant were treated and released.

""Patients have complained of dizziness, of headaches, of lower back pain, of pains related to being bumped, thrown, hit and so forth,"" said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer at Ventura County Medical Center.

Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten credited crash safety technology to softening the blow of the collision. About two-thirds of the Metrolink fleet is 5 years old or less and is equipped with the technology.

""The front end of the cab car is designed to crumple by nature to help absorb the energy of that collision,"" Lustgarten said.

The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate the crash.

"" [ Federal Railroad Administration investigators ] will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the factors that contributed to this accident. Safety must be every railroad's absolute top priority and we will establish what lapses, if any, occurred and order any necessary corrective actions,"" a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration said.

Experts will investigate if the crossing arms were working properly. They will also check the train's recorders. Authorities are optimistic the train had inward and outward facing cameras.

Approximately 24 freight trains and four passenger trains pass through the track near 5th Street and Rice Avenue per day, said Constance Gordon, a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission.

There have been 11 incidents on this specific crossing in the last 10 years, not including the incident which occurred Tuesday. The last incident occurred on June 3, 2014. Gordon said two people were killed.

The train tracks appeared to be heavily damaged following the crash Tuesday, which caused delays and cancellations for Metrolink and Amtrak trains. Amtrak train service between Los Angeles and Goleta was suspended for Tuesday.

Regularly scheduled Metrolink service continued between Union Station in Los Angeles and Moorpark. Buses were provided for passengers traveling beyond Moorpark, with stops at Camarillo, Oxnard and east Ventura.

Repairs could take several months, Lustgarten said.

For information related to passengers, Metrolink urged the public to call (877) 248-8381 or visit http://ht.ly/JAW5c.

The impact from the Metrolink train accident in Oxnard, California, northwest of Los Angeles, knocked over three train cars

OXNARD, Calif. - A Metrolink train derailed Tuesday morning after it collided with a tractor trailer on the tracks in Ventura County, injuring dozens, officials said.

The driver of the truck fled the scene when first responders arrived, but was arrested ""some miles down the road unharmed,"" officials said, adding the driver is currently in police custody. It is unclear if charges have been filed.

An investigator has told The Associated Press the accident occurred when the truck became stuck on the tracks as the driver turned before the crossing. The investigator says the driver is not from the area and made a premature right turn.

An official investigation is ongoing.

Sergio Martinez with the Ventura County Fire Department said there were a total of 51 involved in the accident, including the train's engineer and other railroad employees. Of those, 28 were transported to hospitals, with four in critical condition.

The VC Line 102 train, which was headed southbound to Los Angeles, hit the truck around 5:45 a.m. near 5th Avenue and Rice Street in Oxnard, according to the Ventura County Fire Department.

""For some reason there was a tractor trailer on the tracks there at Rice Avenue and Train 102 collided with it,"" Scott Johnson of Metrolink told CBS Los Angeles.

Martinez said the train was being pushed east by a read locomotive at its normal speed in that spot of about 79 miles per hour. Officials said the preliminary investigation indicates the driver saw the truck on the tracks ""from a great distance"" and attempted to apply the brakes.

All five of the train's cars are considered derailed, and three of them are lying on their side.

The truck caught fire and was left such a scorched and mangled wreckage officials were still not sure late Tuesday morning what type of truck it was.

Martinez said lots of Army equipment passes through the area, but he was not sure that the truck involved in the accident was with the military.

OXNARD, Calif. -- National Transportation Safety Board investigators have determined that the truck involved in the Metrolink train crash in Oxnard was not stuck on the tracks as initially believed.

""Our information is the collision occurred about 80 feet down the railroad track toward Oxnard. It had to travel there somehow. It was not stuck, bottomed out on the track or something like that, it had actually traveled down the railroad track itself,"" said Robert Sumwalt with the National Transportation Safety Board.

About 2,100 crossing accident occur each year, but Tuesday's derailment drew NTSB attention because the truck was found having driven down the tracks. Investigators are expected to remain on scene for five to seven days.

""Our objective is to collect perishable evidence,"" Sumwalt added. ""We are not here to speculate. We never speculate at the NTSB. We're not here on scene to determine the cause of the accident. We're not here on scene to analyze. I know everybody wants to know what happened, and we will determine that, but our goal here is to collect that information that will go away with the passage of time.""

The NTSB is also looking at video and data equipment on the train that should reveal the moments before the crash. Their investigation will likely take months to complete.

Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, 55, of Yuma, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of felony hit-and-run after a Metrolink train headed toward Los Angeles struck his large pickup truck, which was hauling a trailer, on the tracks in Oxnard. He was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday.

Information from the control cab showed the train engineer managed to hit the brakes early, but could not avoid the crash.

Ramirez's lawyer Ron Bamieh called the collision an ""accident."" At the time, Ramirez was driving his company's truck and trailer. He has been employed by the same produce trucking company, The Grower's Company, Inc., for 12 years.

""The arrest of Mr. Ramirez is the unfortunate result of law enforcement attempting to cast blame on a man who was caught in a tragic situation with no way to stop the oncoming tragedy. He does not know how or why the truck he was driving stopped on the tracks, and wishes there was something he could have done to prevent this accident,"" Bamieh said.

Bamieh added that his office's investigation showed that Ramirez's truck did become ""entangled and unable to move off the railroad tracks. The truck and the trailer were somehow stuck.""

Ramirez has been married for 30 years and has two children, his lawyer said. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence.

About 50 people were on board. Twenty-eight people were taken to a hospital, including four in critical condition. No fatalities were reported.

On Wednesday, clean-up efforts continued. All derailed cars had been removed from scene. Track repairs were complete by late-Wednesday morning.

Several Metrolink commuters on Wednesday traveled regularly on the same line of the train that had crashed the day prior.

""First, was shocked and actually also blessed that I wasn't on the train, but more shocked to the people on the train. I feel bad for the people who were injured,"" Camarillo resident Gavin Gobuyan said.

""Right now, I'm getting kind of nervous, but it's in God's hands. You just ride and try to deal with it and hopefully get to your destination,"" Camarillo resident Ken Villa said.

Commuting around the area

Metrolink service on the Ventura County Line is expected to resume regular service a day after a train collided with a pickup truck on the tracks in Oxnard.

Metrolink riders for Ventura County Line Trains 102, 104 and 106 were initially bused around the crash site between the Camarillo, Oxnard or Ventura-East stations and the Moorpark station. The track was restored Wednesday morning and the first passenger train to pass through the crash site was scheduled to arrive at about 5:40 p.m.

Amtrak trains, which were suspended in the area on Tuesday, also resumed regular service in the area. The changes impacted Pacific Surfliner and Coast Starlight trains 11 and 14.

Drivers passing through the area may face some delays. Fifth Street between Rice Avenue and Del Norte Boulevard was closed for clean-up crews. One northbound lane on Rice Avenue was shut down near Fifth Street.

No passengers were killed, according to the Ventura County fire department spokesman, Captain Mike Lindbery. It is believed that a tractor trailer was sitting on the tracks when it was struck by the train.

“For some reason there was a tractor trailer on the tracks there at Rice Avenue and train 102 collided with it,” Scott Johnson of Metrolink told CBS Los Angeles. The driver fled but was later apprehended, Lindbery said.

Three toppled rail cars could be seen from local television station helicopter footage, with dozens of firefighters gathered around the scene.

The crash occurred just before 6am. By 6.10am, Metrolink officials announced that the tracks were closed after line 102 struck a vehicle, and photos of a fire on the tracks, believed to be the truck, began surfacing around 6.20am.

on the tracks in Oxnard today and derailed, interrupting rail service from
Ventura County and sending 28 people to hospitals, including four in critical
condition, authorities said.
The crash occurred shortly before 6 a.m. just east of the Oxnard
Station, near Rice Avenue and Fifth Street. Ventura County Line train 102 was
en route to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles when the crash occurred, said
Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten.
The four passenger cars and the locomotive — which was at the rear,
pushing the train — derailed, according to the Oxnard Fire Department. The
three forward passenger cars tipped over on their side, said Metrolink
spokesman Scott Johnson.
The truck driver, who was not injured, got out of the vehicle and ran
off, but was taken into custody by law enforcement officers, the fire
department reported.
The single track is owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad,
and shared by other rail operators, Johnson said. It could take all day to
clear the scene, officials said.
Fifty-one people were assessed at the scene for possible injuries, and
28 of them were transported for hospital treatment, four of them in critical
condition, the fire department reported. No fatalities were reported.
According to the fire department, trains can reach 79 mph along that
stretch of track, but the engineer saw the truck and began slowing the train
before impact.
The train consisted of four passenger cars and a locomotive at the rear,
Johnson said. The engineer was in the first passenger car — known as the
“cab car” — and was operating the train from there. The engineer and the
conductor were among the injured, Johnson said.
The cab car, along with the third and fourth passenger cars, were newer
cars, equipped with “collision energy management technology,” which is
designed to “send the impact outward instead of inward and prevent
crumpling,” Johnson said. The second passenger car was an older car,
retrofitted to accommodate bicycles.
Johnson said the Metrolink/Amtrak “shared train” 761 from Union
Station to Oxnard has been canceled for today. Rail passengers were urged to
use alternate transportation.
Buses were sent to the scene to accommodate stranded rail passengers.
In 2008, a Metrolink train head towards Moorpark from Union Station
colided with a freight train and derailed in Chatsworth, killing 25 and injuring
over 100 people.

OXNARD, CA -- A commuter train bound for Los Angeles derailed before dawn Tuesday in a fiery collision with an abandoned commercial pickup truck after its driver took a wrong turn and got stuck on the tracks.



There was a loud boom and the screech of brakes before three of the train's five cars toppled over, sending 30 people to hospitals. Four were in critical condition, including the engineer.



""It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,"" said passenger Joel Bingham. ""A brush of death definitely came over me.""



Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash. They were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said. The four passenger cars remained largely intact as did the locomotive.



Police found the disoriented driver of the demolished Ford F-450 pickup 1.6 miles from the crossing 45 minutes after the crash, said Jason Benites, an assistant chief of the Oxnard Police Department.



The truck driver, Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday afternoon on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, Benites said.



Sanchez Ramirez was hauling an empty trailer to deliver produce and told police he tried to turn right at an intersection but turned prematurely and his truck got stuck straddling the rails. He was briefly hospitalized but later released and arrested.



The crossing has been the scene of many collisions over the years.



The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles, about 65 miles away, when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m. There were 48 passengers aboard and three crew members who were all injured.



The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes, but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said.



Bingham said the lights went out when the train fell over. He was banged up from head to toe but managed to find an escape for himself and others where the train was resting above a ditch.



""I was just shaking,"" he said. ""I opened the window and told everybody, 'Come to my voice.'""



Firefighters set up red, yellow and green tarps to categorize people according to their injuries, taking 28 to hospitals by ambulance. Two of the 22 people treated at the scene later showed up at hospitals, but only eight were admitted by the end of the day.



""Patients have complained of dizziness, of headaches, of lower back pain, of pains related to being bumped, thrown, hit and so forth,"" said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer at Ventura County Medical Center.



One patient described how he had been working on his laptop and a moment later there was a sudden jerking motion that happened so quickly he wasn't able to grab hold of anything, Wong said. He was violently tossed against a wall of the train.



The train typically would be accelerating out of the Oxnard station past verdant farm fields at about 55 mph, Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said. With braking, he estimated it would have hit the truck at between 40 mph and 55 mph.



The train was pushed by a locomotive in the rear, allowing trains to change direction after their run without having to turn around or swap engines. It's a configuration that has been criticized for putting passengers in a vulnerable position in a crash.



After such a crash killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily to buy passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact.



Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked.



""Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,"" he said.



The city of Oxnard has wanted to build a $30 million bridge over the crossing for 10 years, but is only at the environmental review stage, said Darren Kettle, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission.



There have been six accidents at the crossing in the past seven years, including one in which a driver accidently turned onto the tracks in 2010 and was struck by a Metrolink train and injured, according to federal railroad accident reports. Two people were killed at the crossing last year when a car struck an Amtrak train.



The driver in Tuesday's crash said he turned onto the tracks before the crossing arm came down, which occurs 29 seconds before a train arrives. It wasn't clear how long his truck was stuck before the train hit it.



The accident happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster when 25 people were killed Sept. 12, 2008. A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth. More than 100 people were hurt in what was one of the worst railroad accidents in U.S. history.



The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration were sending investigators to the Tuesday crash in Oxnard.

In Tuesday’s crash of a Metrolink commuter train in Oxnard, the railroad’s new passenger cars, which represent the state of the art in safety design, performed well, officials say.

The collision was, however, the fourth serious accident involving a train that was being pushed from behind by a locomotive -- a common practice that has been questioned in the past.

Keith Millhouse, mayor pro tem of Moorpark in Ventura County and a Metrolink board member, said three of the railroad’s new Rotem passenger cars passed their first test involving an actual crash.

“The injuries came from people being tossed around,” Millhouse said. “The Rotem cars received very minor damage. They performed the way they should in terms of collision absorption. This could have been tremendously worse without them.”

Officials said 28 people were injured and taken to hospitals when the commuter train hit a pickup truck. Four were said to be in critical condition. Twenty-three other passengers were uninjured.

Metrolink has replaced almost all its fleet of passenger cars with the Rotem coaches, which have crush zones, breakaway tables, improved emergency exits and seating arrangements that can reduce the risk of passengers being thrown into fixtures or one another in an accident.

LIVE UPDATES: Oxnard Metrolink crash

Tuesday’s crash, however, is the fourth accident involving Metrolink trains that were being pushed by locomotives from behind and controlled from the front by lighter cab cars, a passenger coach with an engineer’s station.

The practice, which is commonly used by commuter railroads, has been controversial. Some safety experts say that trains with their heavy locomotives at the front might have a lower risk of derailment in collisions with motor vehicles on the tracks.

Millhouse said the National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating all aspects of Tuesday’s crash, including how much the so-called push-pull operation contributed to the crash. He noted that the Rotem cab cars were significantly heavier than the older Bombardier cab cars involved in previous Metrolink crashes.

“We don’t know why this occurred,” Millhouse said. “If the locomotive had been in front, there could have been a fire from leaking fuel due to the impact. I don’t think push-pull had anything to do with it, but that is just speculation.”

The Federal Railroad Administration announced Tuesday that it was sending investigators to the scene.

“Safety must be every railroad’s absolute top priority, and we will establish what lapses, if any, occurred and order any necessary corrective actions,” said Mike England, an agency spokesman. “This morning’s accident on Metrolink’s Ventura County Line is a tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.”

Local  resident  Lowell Withington,  76,  died  when  his pickup  truck  was  hit  by  a  train  at  an  unprotected  private crossing in Moorpark on Monday. 

Withington was heading west on Poindexter Avenue. He turned  onto  a driveway that  crossed  the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks to access open land he was leasing on the north side of the tracks when the train arrived. 

As the vehicle was crossing the tracks, the eastbound Amtrak train headed for San Diego struck the driver’s side of the vehicle, sending it into a nearby drainage ditch, said Ron Nelson, spokesperson for the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department. 
AFTERMATH- Fire  and emergency  crews  clear  away the  wreckage  of Withington’s vehicle after a fatal collision.
The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. No one on the train was injured, Nelson said in a press release. 

The train was traveling about 50 miles per hour, said Sr. Dep. Ed Tumbleson for the Moorpark Police Department. The speed limit in the area is 70 miles per hour. The train’s horns were blaring, but the driver never stopped or slowed down, witnesses told police at the scene.x 

Withington,  who  lived  on  Gabbert  Road,  frequently drove across the private crossing to get to the open lot, the deputy said. 

Withington was president of Midway Drilling and Pump Company in Saticoy. 

“He was a very hard-working and caring individual and would make sure that all jobs were done as best as they could for the customers,” said office manager Sandy Cornelius. Withington was a generous man who would give anybody the shirt off his back, she added. 

The  Moorpark  resident  was married to Willa Withington for 54 years. He had two daughters and one son, Harvey Withington, who will now maintain the company, Cornelius said. 

The  unprotected  railroad tracks have been a longstanding problem, said Hugh Riley, assistant city manager for the city of Moorpark. “But the tracks are on private  property,  so  the  city doesn’t have any jurisdiction.” 

“It’s very sad,” said Councilmember  Keith  Millhouse, who serves on a Metrolink committee. 

Although he didn’t know the circumstances of the accident and what caused it, Millhouse wanted to remind people to be extra cautious around rail crossings. 

“We don’t know what caused the collision but trains are deceptive  in  terms  of  the  speed  they move at,” Millhouse said. 

“My thoughts and prayers go with the family,” he said. Officials will review the complete accident report  in  detail,  he  added,  and determine if anything can be done to prevent a similar accident in the future.

A video being taken to show the dangers of a railway crossing ended up capturing the real thing when an Amtrak train smashed through a truck carrying strawberries in Oxnard, Calif.

Gaspar Medina told Associated Press Television News that the incident happened just minutes after setting up his two cameras on Monday afternoon.

The six-wagon train, carrying 80 passengers, did not derail. Two passengers were treated for neck and chest injuries. The truck driver was not injured.

Witnesses told police that the truck, driven by a Theresa Ann Senator of South Dakota, drove under the crossing arms that were being lowered and then stopped on the tracks, according to the Ventura County Star newspaper.

Amtrak passenger Kathleen Paine described the impact as ""like hitting a brick wall,"" the newspaper reported.

Another passenger, Mark Lindgren, said ""it felt like you were hitting a gigantic pothole.""

Police said the impact caused the train’s engine to separate from the six cars it was pulling, but Amtrak denied that.

Medina said he felt the warning bells had not given the truck driver enough time to move out of the crossing.

The railroad crossing arms had fallen, and the warning bells were clanging — but Mylicia Mailcoff could not move her car.

With seconds to spare, a man ran from a nearby shop and yelled at the teenager to get off the tracks. They bolted to safety moments before a northbound Union Pacific Railroad train demolished her Honda Civic to warped metal and shattered glass.

East-west traffic was cut off around Pennington Road and other nearby Live Oak railroad crossings for more than an hour Friday as the wreck was investigated and cleared. The Pennington crossing reopened at 4:45 p.m.

Mailcoff, 18, was driving east on Pennington Road but was stopped on the tracks because of cars backed up to the traffic signal at Highway 99.

When the light turned green, she tried to drive forward, but her car stalled and she could not start it again, said Sutter County sheriff's Deputy Adrian Perez.

A boy ran to help her, but they could not drive or push the car off the tracks, Perez said.

The Union Pacific Railroad conductor, whose name was not released, tried to slow down about one-half mile before the crash but was unable to avoid the wreck, Perez said. No one was injured in the crash.

Rudy Heredia was the good Samaritan who ran to help Mailcoff. He saw what was about to happen from his auto repair shop across the street.

""I was just being a good citizen,"" he said. ""You see somebody that needs help, it's pretty normal.""

He also attributed his response to parental instinct.

""I have a girl around that age, too,"" he said.

That stretch of Pennington, just before the lights at Highway 99 and adjacent to his shop on Broadway, is a notorious problem spot, Heredia said. The recent start of school only compounds the problem.

""The way they come flying around the corner,"" he said. ""They need more lights. This'll probably wake the City Council up.""

Another train accident stalled traffic in Live Oak for more than two hours in March, when a driver using an unapproved crossing just off Nevada Street, north of Kola Street, became stuck and his truck was hit by an approaching northbound Union Pacific Railroad train.

No one was injured.
