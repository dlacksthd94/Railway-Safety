          "question": "As a remote control operator (RCO), am I required to be certified the same as a locomotive engineer?",
          "answer": "Yes. The engineer certification regulation requires that anyone who moves a locomotive must be certified. There are two exceptions: 1) when operating a locomotive(s) within the confines of a locomotive repair or servicing area (no cars attached); and 2) when moving a locomotive(s) for distances of less than 100 feet for inspection and maintenance purposes.",

        {
          "question": "What is required for certification?",
          "answer": "The railroad must evaluate the employee’s safety conduct. This is accomplished by reviewing the employee’s work records, state and federal motor vehicle operator records, and the employee’s compliance with drug and alcohol regulations. The employee must also meet certain hearing and visual acuity standards and pass a written knowledge test (rules test) and a skills performance test [demonstrate skills to operate a remote control locomotive (RCL) to a designated supervisor of locomotive engineers].",

          "question": "I was convicted of a DWI four years ago. Will this affect my certification status?",
          "answer": "No. The regulation prohibits the railroad from considering information that occurred more than 36 months from the month in which the certification decision will be made.",

        {
          "question": "I had my driver’s license suspended for speeding. Will this affect my certification status?",
          "answer": "No. The railroad is only allowed to consider a conviction or completed state action that resulted in a license suspension for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or a controlled substance, or for refusing to undergo such testing.",

          "question": "I am a new hire and had my driver’s license suspended for a DWI two years ago. What will happen when the railroad discovers this during the motor vehicle operator records check?",
          "answer": "The railroad is required to provide this information to the railroad’s EAP Counselor and refer you for an evaluation to determine if you have an active substance abuse disorder. If the evaluation determines that you do not have a substance abuse problem, nothing further will occur. If it is determined that you do have an active substance abuse disorder, you will be required to complete a program of treatment before you are eligible for certification again.",

        },
        {
          "question": "What if I fail the hearing and visual acuity test?",
          "answer": "You are entitled to a retest. If you fail the retest, it is still possible to be certified if the railroad’s medical examiner, after consultation with the railroad’s DSLE, concludes that you can still operate safely. This is purely elective on the railroad’s part and is usually tied to collective bargaining agreements addressing medical and physical fitness issues. The railroad may issue you a certificate with special restrictions if recommended by the medical examiner.",

        },
        {
          "question": "How far away from the instructor can I be while operating the RCL?",
          "answer": "The instructor must be close enough to monitor your performance and take immediate corrective action in the event of an emergency. To put this into perspective, under traditional locomotive operations, the instructor engineer is not allowed to leave the cab of the locomotive while the student is operating. This would prevent the engineer from placing the train into emergency in the event of trouble. Some railroads provide the instructor with a means to place the RCL into emergency if the student gets into trouble. This would allow the instructor to be some distance from the student. FRA considers this acceptable. However, in each and every case, the instructor must be able to observe the student and his or her actions to properly monitor the student’s activities.",

        {
          "question": "What type of training can I expect to receive as an RCO?",
          "answer": "Until recently, the majority of RCL training programs consisted of approximately 80 hours of classroom and on-the-job training. However, during the latter part of 2008, the major railroads (BNSF, CN, CSX, KCS, NS, UP) implemented new RCL training programs that were jointly developed by FRA, Rail Labor, and Rail management. The new programs contain task lists that will be furnished to RCO Students. The students will practice each task a predetermined number of times and will then be required to demonstrate proficiency in that task. The instructor will be required to sign off on each task completed. This type of training will ensure that the students are trained on all the tasks they are expected to perform as an RCO. These task lists are considered Federal documents and should be completed properly. These programs have been submitted to FRA and have all been approved.",

        {
          "question": "What if I encounter a specific task or movement I was not trained to perform?",
          "answer": "No training is all inclusive. You may encounter moves you have not actually performed, but have made similar moves that provide you with sufficient operating experience to make the move safely. However, if you are confronted with a move you have no idea how to handle, notify the railroad for guidance.",

        {
          "question": "Can I operate from the cab of the locomotive and can I sit in the engineer’s seat?",
          "answer": "Yes. There is nothing in the regulation that prohibits you from occupying the cab of the locomotive while performing RCL operations. However, you should not operate the locomotive from its control stand unless you were specifically trained to do so. If you are performing a train movement (leaving the yard for some other location), you should be located in the cab, out of harms way, and in a position to observe the air gauges and speed recorder during the movement.",

          "question": "Can I leave the yard and operate on the main track or an industrial lead?",
          "answer": "Yes. However, there are certain limitations on the types of trains that can be hauled using the current RCL technology and you must be properly trained for these moves. FRA has taken the position that any move that requires a brake test under Part 232 becomes a train movement rather than a switching movement. Railroads have air brake and train handling instructions to govern engineers operating trains. These instructions are currently incompatible with RCL technology. Therefore, railroads must develop instructions governing RCOs operating RCL trains. The RCOs must be trained on these instructions and trained on the routes they will travel. The amount of training time will depend on the operations involved and should be arrived at through the collaborative efforts of local labor and management.",

        {
          "question": "Can I ride on the side of a car while operating the RCL?",
          "answer": "Yes. However, FRA leaves that decision to the RCO who best knows the conditions at the time. FRA believes that employees are empowered to determine when it is safe to ride a car and when it is not. FRA’s safety advisory initially recommended against this practice with the understanding that an RCO would be required to manipulate two controls simultaneously to control speed while attempting to hold onto the side of a car while riding it. However, the newer technology incorporated a speed control system that allowed the RCO to dial in a speed and maintain three to four points of contact with the car.",

        {
          "question": "If I am accused of committing a rule violation, can the railroad just revoke my certification without an opportunity for a hearing?",
          "answer": "No. Following an alleged rule violation, the railroad is obligated to take the following actions: 1) based upon reliable information, suspend your certification pending an investigation of the incident; 2) notify you of the reasons for the suspension; and 3) inform you that you are entitled to a certification hearing under the regulation. You must be afforded a hearing before your certificate is revoked.",

        },
        {
          "question": "Is a hearing always required for a certificate revocation to occur?",
          "answer": "No. Similar to most collective bargaining agreements, you can waive your right to a certification hearing and accepting responsibility for the incident. However, in order for the waiver to be valid under the regulation it must: 1) be in writing; 2) reflect the fact that you are waiving your right to a Federal certification hearing; and 3) be signed by you.",

        {
          "question": "If the railroad revokes my certification, do I have the right to appeal this decision?",
          "answer": "Yes. The regulation contains a dispute resolution process. You have 120 days from the date on the railroad’s revocation decision letter to file a petition with FRA’s Locomotive Engineer Review Board.",

          "question": "The RCL operations on my railroad involve a “pitch and catch” operation. If for some reason a decertifiable event occurs, such as the locomotive passing a stop signal, will both assigned RCOs be subject to decertification?",
          "answer": "No. Only the RCO operating the RCL at the time of the incident would be subject to decertification. However, if the non-operating RCO or another certified individual is functioning as a pilot or instructor, he or she could also be held responsible and subject to decertification.",

          "question": "The man-down tilt feature located on the remote control transmitter (beltpack) that the RCO wears activates each time I bend over beyond a 45-degree angle. If I purposely attach the beltpack to myself in such a fashion that the device will not activate when I bend over, am I in violation of any regulation?",
          "answer": "Yes. This feature is considered a safety device and is covered by FRA tampering regulations. Tampering with a safety device or knowingly operating a locomotive with the device cutout is a decertifiable event.",

        {
          "question": "In a pitch & catch operation, if one beltpack fails, can the operation continue with one beltpack?",
          "answer": "Yes. Neither FRA’s safety advisory nor any Federal regulation prohibits a one-beltpack operation. However, it is expected that the crew would initiate a thorough job briefing to ensure that each member of the crew understands his or her new responsibilities.",

          "question": "If I am a certified engineer who has been set back as a conductor, do I need the same training as a noncertified employee in order to operate RCLs?",
          "answer": "No. Your training could be significantly reduced since you already possess train handling skills. The training programs vary from railroad to railroad. Some railroads require all employees to complete the entire training program, while others have developed a 2-3 day RCL training program for engineers.",

          "question": "I am an RCO who has not worked an RCL assignment for several months. Do I need some refresher training before I can work an RCL assignment again?",
          "answer": "The railroad should have a policy in place to address this issue. Generally, a short absence from RCL may not be an issue, depending on the initial experience gained after certification. However, if an individual only worked a few weeks as an RCO after certification, and then bid off the job or was bumped to a non-RCL job for several months, the RCO may need some refresher training when coming back to an RCL job. If the technology features have changed significantly since the RCO was last trained, additional training in that area may be warranted as well depending on the nature of the changes. Under most circumstances, RCOs are given a qualifying trip or two with an RCL crew to refamiliarize them with the operation of the equipment.",

          "answer": "- A party adversely affected by the Board decision has the right to request that FRA provide an administrative hearing. Thus, if the Board finds in favor of the railroad, the locomotive engineer or conductor has the right to request a hearing. If the Board finds in favor of the engineer or conductor, the railroad may request a hearing. 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.407(a) or 242.507(a).\n\n- If the Board denies a petition as untimely, the aggrieved party may file an appeal directly with the FRA Administrator in accordance with 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.403(e) and 240.411 (Locomotive Engineer Review Board), or 49 C.F.R. §§ 242.503(d) and 242.511 (Operating Crew Review Board). Where a party files an appeal from a Board decision pursuant to §§ 240.403(e) or 242.503(d), the Administrator may affirm or vacate the Board's decision, and may remand the petition to the Board for further proceedings. An Administrator's decision to affirm the Board's decision constitutes final agency action. 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.411(e) and (f), or 242.511(e) and (f).",

Twenty-three days are provided, rather than the 20 days stated in the regulations, in order to account for the added mailing period. Please note that you are encouraged to retain the envelope from the Board’s decision in case there arises an allegation that you did not file a timely request.\n\n- In computing the 23[rd ]day, please do not count the date the Board’s decision was mailed.\n\n- If the 23[rd] day falls on a day that the DOT’s Docket Operations office is closed [i.e., a Saturday, a Sunday or Federal holiday] you must file your request before the end of the next day in which the DOT’s Docket Operations office is open and accessible.

          "answer": "- A written request for an administrative hearing must be filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Operations (M-30), West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, D.C. 20590, or an electronic request for an administrative hearing must be posted at http://www.regulations.gov. 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.407(b) or 242.507(b). More detailed instructions for submitting acceptable requests for an administrative hearing are answered in response to the next question. Please note that for locomotive engineer cases this office is different than the filing address for the earlier Board review. DO NOT FILE YOUR REQUEST FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING WITH FRA’S DOCKET CLERK - it will only delay the actual filing with the appropriate office listed above. Conductor cases will retain the same docket.\n\n- Background Information: When an administrative hearing is requested, a new docket for a locomotive engineer case is created that will be completely available electronically. While you should reference the FRA docket number used for the Board’s review in your engineer submission, your administrative hearing docket submission will not be put into that FRA docket created just for the Board’s review.\n\n- As the docket will be available electronically to the public, FRA recommends that each party be careful to redact Social Security numbers, employee identification numbers that may be the same as a Social Security number, or any other information that is private in nature and should not be shared with the general public.",

          "question": "What are the acceptable forms of a request for an administrative hearing?",
          "answer": "- Current acceptable forms of such a request include hand delivery, mailing, electronic submission, and fax.\n\n- Hand delivery requires physically delivering your written request to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Operations (M-30), West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., in Washington, D.C.\n\n- Mailing requires sending your written request by United States Postal Service or private delivery service to the same address for hand delivery.\n\n- Filers are encouraged to use the electronic submission system at http://www.regulations.gov but with the understanding that, for locomotive engineer cases, a docket must first be created before a document can be filed in it. To have a docket created, DOT’s Docket Operations and FRA have developed a procedure by which a filer may electronically submit a document to a pre-existing docket called a “shell docket.” When you go to http://www.regulations.gov, enter FRA’s shell docket number “FRA-2007-0003” in the box for “Enter Keyword or ID.” Once you search for this shell docket, you will open a new window for the shell docket and see that it is titled “Instructions on submitting comments for Guidance Documents to FRA.” When you are viewing the shell docket, the abstract explains that you must click on the “Submit a Comment” button at the top of the page and follow the online instructions. FRA would expect that users will enter the required information and upload a file, although it may not be necessary to type a comment in the comment box provided.\n\n- If you wish to file by fax, FRA recommends that you call DOT’s Docket Operations at (202) 366-9826 or toll free at (800) 647-5527 to confirm that its fax number is (202) 493-2251.

Reg. 22 (Jan. 2, 2002). The amended definition states that “[f]ile, filed and filing mean submission of a document under this part on the date when the Docket Clerk receives it, or if sent by mail on or after September 4, 2001, the date mailing was completed.”\n\n- Pursuant to this definition, if you file by hand delivery then you must make sure that DOT’s Docket Operations receives it no later than 5:00 p.m., eastern standard or daylight savings time, whichever is in effect in the District of Columbia at the time, on the date it is due. The business hours for DOT’s Docket Operations facility are Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., except Federal holidays.\n\n- If you file by USPS or other mail services, you must make sure that the postmark or your receipt reflect that your request was mailed no later than the date it is due.\n\n- If you file a request for a hearing electronically through www.regulations.gov then you must make sure that your electronic submission is received no later than midnight the date it is due.\n\n- If you file a request for a hearing by fax, you must make sure that DOT’s Docket Operations receives it no later than 5:00 p.m., eastern standard or daylight savings time, whichever is in effect in the District of Columbia at the time, on the date it is due.

          "answer": "- Yes. Plans for meeting the performance standard at new or altered stations where track adjacent to the platform is shared with freight traffic must be submitted on a station-by-station basis.\n\n- That is, there must be a separate plan for each such station. It is not sufficient to have a generic plan for a line or a system.\n\n- While there may well be common features of a railroad’s plans for various stations in its system, there are also likely to be differences among stations. The design and layout of stations, the number of trains that stop at the station, the passenger volume at the station, whether there are other railroads that use the station, and other factors are likely to vary from station to station. Station plans need to take these variables into account at each station.\n\n- In reviewing station plans, FRA and FTA intend to give particular scrutiny to larger, more complex, stations and those with higher passenger volumes to ensure that the railroad’s plan will fully meet the performance standard in practice.",

          "question": "Where the requirements of Section 37.42 apply, which cars of a train does a railroad operator have to make available to passengers with disabilities?",
          "answer": "- The performance standard of section 37.42(a) requires that passengers with disabilities “must have access to all accessible cars available to passengers without disabilities in each train using the station.\n\n- The standard applies only to “accessible” cars meeting the requirements of 49 CFR Part 38. Some railroads continue to operate a number of inaccessible cars (e.g., 1950s-era double-decker commuter cars) that people with mobility impairments cannot enter and use. The requirement does not apply to cars of this kind.\n\n- Moreover, the standard applies only to “cars available to passengers without disabilities” at a given station. There can be a number of situations in which not all cars in a train are made available to anyone at a station.\n\n- For example, at a station with a relatively short platform, only cars 1-4 of an 8-car train may be available to any passenger. In some commuter rail systems, only two cars are open to be boarded by any passenger at a station.\n\n- In situations like these, only those cars that are made available to other passengers at the station have to be made available to passengers with disabilities. The railroad operator generally would not be required to make cars available to passengers with disabilities that are not made available to other passengers.\n\n- However, if all wheelchair locations are occupied by other wheelchair users in cars where the doors normally open at a station, the Department expects the railroad operator to double-stop or move a lift, where necessary, in order to provide transportation to a wheelchair user in an unoccupied wheelchair location. (Of course, railroad operators are always responsible for moving passengers’ luggage and other items out of wheelchair locations to permit their use by a wheelchair user.) Likewise, if the only way a passenger with a disability can access a food service car is through an adjacent car, then the railroad should provide access to the adjacent car.",

          "question": "When a rail operator constructs a new station platform or alters an existing station platform, does 49 CFR Part 37 require the rail operator ensure that the platform is at least 8 inches above top of rail, even if the railroad operator will provide accessibility consistent with the requirements of Section 37.42?",
          "answer": "- Public entities, such as Amtrak and commuter operators, must construct a new facility for use in designated public transportation so that it is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.41(a)). Likewise, when a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of such a facility, the entity must make the alterations in such a way that the altered part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.43(a)(1)). This latter requirement also specifically applies to alterations of an intercity or commuter rail station by its owner, the 'responsible person' for the station, or a person in control of the station (see sec. 37.43(a)(3)).\n\n- A transportation facility is considered to be accessible if it meets the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG; see 36 CFR Part 1191, including Appendices B and D), as modified by Appendix A to Part 37.\n\n- Appendix A to Part 37 (see section 801.5.3) provides that low-level platforms in rail stations must be at least 8 inches above top of rail (ATR). We note that there may be rare situations in which meeting this requirement is impracticable (e.g., there is a highway grade crossing intersecting the platform). FRA and/or FTA will address such unusual situations on a case-by-case basis, as needed.\n\n- Because of these requirements, when an intercity or commuter railroad constructs or alters a platform, it must ensure the platform is at least 8 inches ATR. Note that alterations to parts of a station other than the platform do not trigger this requirement.\n\n- In addition to this basic facility accessibility requirement, section 37.42 requires a railroad that alters a station platform and does not provide level boarding to ensure that passengers with disabilities can board any accessible car of a train available to other passengers at that station, using means including car-borne lifts, station-based lifts, or mini-high platforms. Meeting this requirement does not exempt the railroad from the separate requirement to ensure that an altered or newly constructed platform is at least 8 inches ATR.\n\n- While a platform 8 inches above ATR generally does not provide level boarding, a platform at this height does facilitate boarding by ambulatory passengers, including passengers (e.g., elderly persons) who might have difficulty ascending a vertical distance greater than the normal vertical gap between an 8-inch ATR platform and the first step of a railroad car.",

          "question": "What is the difference among the terms denial of certification, denial of recertification and revocation?",
          "answer": "- Denial of certification refers to the situation in which a person who is not a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not grant the person initial certification. A railroad might choose to deny a person certification if the railroad decides that the person, despite having finished a railroad-approved training program, cannot pass all of the minimum requirements. For example, the person may not have passed the skills performance or knowledge tests, or the person did not meet the minimum hearing and vision requirements. The rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad’s basis for denying certification. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Denial of recertification refers to the situation in which a person who is a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not be renewing the person’s certificate when it is due to expire. The regulations require that railroads renew a certificate at least every three (3) years. 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.217(c) and 242.201(c). Like a denial of certification, a denial of recertification may be based on a person’s inability to meet any of the minimum requirements and the rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad’s basis for denying recertification. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Certificate revocation refers to the situation in which the railroad determines that a certified locomotive engineer or conductor either (1) has violated a cardinal operating rule or practice [as specified in 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.117(e) and 242.403(e)] or (2) is ineligible to hold a certificate due to a substance abuse disorder or violations of FRA’s alcohol and drug regulations. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.119 and 242.115. Prior to revoking a person’s certificate, the regulations require a railroad to provide the certified engineer or conductor with 'the opportunity for a hearing;' however, that opportunity can be waived. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.307 and 242.407.",

See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.403(c). A person who has been denied a conductor certification or recertification has 120 days from the date of the railroad’s decision to file a petition, however the Board may extend the filing period for cause shown (see below). 49 C.F.R. § 242.503(c).\n\n- CERTIFICATE REVOCATION: A person has 120 days from the date of the railroad’s revocation decision to file a petition. See 49 C.F.R. 240.403(d) and 242.503(c).\n\n- In computing the 180[th] or 120[th] day, please do not count the date the railroad’s decision was issued. Also, please be advised that the date the railroad issued its decision may be earlier than the date you received or were served with a copy of that decision.\n\n- If the 180[th] or 120[th] day falls on a day that the Docket Clerk’s office is closed [i.e., a Saturday, a Sunday or Federal holiday] you must file your request before the end of the next day in which the Docket Clerk’s office is open and accessible.

See 64 Fed. Reg. 60966, 60983 (Nov. 8, 1999). Such a petitioner needs to demonstrate some justification for the Board to grant the extension as the regulation requires cause to be shown. Moreover, it is recommended that a petitioner specify how much additional time will be needed to file the petition keeping in mind that only reasonable requests will be granted.\n\n- If the deadline has already passed, the petitioner must allege the facts constituting “excusable neglect,” and the mere assertion of excusable neglect unsupported by facts is insufficient. Excusable neglect requires a demonstration of good faith on the part of the party seeking an extension of time and some reasonable basis for noncompliance with the time specified in the rules. In most cases, demonstrating justification requires sending the Board evidence substantiating the reason an extension is needed along with any explanation. Absent a showing along these lines, relief will likely be denied.",

In reaching its decision, the Board may request and rely upon additional evidence or argument from the parties that was not initially submitted. The Board is not empowered to mitigate the consequences of the railroad decision, if that decision is valid under this regulation. The Board is only empowered to make determinations concerning qualifications under this regulation. The contractual consequences, if any, of those determinations must be resolved under dispute resolution mechanisms that do not directly involve FRA.

Thus, if the Board finds in favor of the railroad, the locomotive engineer or conductor has the right to request a hearing. If the Board finds in favor of the engineer or conductor, the railroad may request a hearing. 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.407(a) or 242.507(a).\n\n- If the Board denies a petition as untimely, the aggrieved party may file an appeal directly with the FRA Administrator in accordance with 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.403(e) and 240.411 (Locomotive Engineer Review Board), or 49 C.F.R. §§ 242.503(d) and 242.511 (Operating Crew Review Board). Where a party files an appeal from a Board decision pursuant to §§ 240.403(e) or 242.503(d), the Administrator may affirm or vacate the Board's decision, and may remand the petition to the Board for further proceedings.

More detailed instructions for submitting acceptable requests for an administrative hearing are answered in response to the next question. Please note that for locomotive engineer cases this office is different than the filing address for the earlier Board review. DO NOT FILE YOUR REQUEST FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING WITH FRA’S DOCKET CLERK - it will only delay the actual filing with the appropriate office listed above. Conductor cases will retain the same docket.\n\n- Background Information: When an administrative hearing is requested, a new docket for a locomotive engineer case is created that will be completely available electronically. While you should reference the FRA docket number used for the Board’s review in your engineer submission, your administrative hearing docket submission will not be put into that FRA docket created just for the Board’s review.\n\n- As the docket will be available electronically to the public, FRA recommends that each party be careful to redact Social Security numbers, employee identification numbers that may be the same as a Social Security number, or any other information that is private in nature and should not be shared with the general public.",

To have a docket created, DOT’s Docket Operations and FRA have developed a procedure by which a filer may electronically submit a document to a pre-existing docket called a “shell docket.” When you go to http://www.regulations.gov, enter FRA’s shell docket number “FRA-2007-0003” in the box for “Enter Keyword or ID.” Once you search for this shell docket, you will open a new window for the shell docket and see that it is titled “Instructions on submitting comments for Guidance Documents to FRA.” When you are viewing the shell docket, the abstract explains that you must click on the “Submit a Comment” button at the top of the page and follow the online instructions. FRA would expect that users will enter the required information and upload a file, although it may not be necessary to type a comment in the comment box provided.\n\n- If you wish to file by fax, FRA recommends that you call DOT’s Docket Operations at (202) 366-9826 or toll free at (800) 647-5527 to confirm that its fax number is (202) 493-2251.

          "question": "What is the difference among the terms denial of certification, denial of recertification and revocation?",
          "answer": "- Denial of certification refers to the situation in which a person who is not a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not grant the person initial certification. A railroad might choose to deny a person certification if the railroad decides that the person, despite having finished a railroad-approved training program, cannot pass all of the minimum requirements. For example, the person may not have passed the skills performance or knowledge tests, or the person did not meet the minimum hearing and vision requirements. The rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad’s basis for denying certification. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Denial of recertification refers to the situation in which a person who is a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not be renewing the person’s certificate when it is due to expire. The regulations require that railroads renew a certificate at least every three (3) years. 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.217(c) and 242.201(c). Like a denial of certification, a denial of recertification may be based on a person’s inability to meet any of the minimum requirements and the rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad’s basis for denying recertification. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Certificate revocation refers to the situation in which the railroad determines that a certified locomotive engineer or conductor either (1) has violated a cardinal operating rule or practice [as specified in 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.117(e) and 242.403(e)] or (2) is ineligible to hold a certificate due to a substance abuse disorder or violations of FRA’s alcohol and drug regulations. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 240.119 and 242.115.

A person who has been denied a conductor certification or recertification has 120 days from the date of the railroad’s decision to file a petition, however the Board may extend the filing period for cause shown (see below). 49 C.F.R. § 242.503(c).\n\n- CERTIFICATE REVOCATION: A person has 120 days from the date of the railroad’s revocation decision to file a petition.

See 64 Fed. Reg. 60966, 60983 (Nov. 8, 1999). Such a petitioner needs to demonstrate some justification for the Board to grant the extension as the regulation requires cause to be shown. Moreover, it is recommended that a petitioner specify how much additional time will be needed to file the petition keeping in mind that only reasonable requests will be granted.\n\n- If the deadline has already passed, the petitioner must allege the facts constituting 'excusable neglect,' and the mere assertion of excusable neglect unsupported by facts is insufficient. Excusable neglect requires a demonstration of good faith on the part of the party seeking an extension of time and some reasonable basis for noncompliance with the time specified in the rules. In most cases, demonstrating justification requires sending the Board evidence substantiating the reason an extension is needed along with any explanation. Absent a showing along these lines, relief will likely be denied.",

          "answer": "FRA’s RRP is an industry-wide initiative designed to improve safety and build strong safety cultures, by developing innovative methods, processes, and technologies to identify and correct safety risk factors using “upstream” predictive data. The RRP will allow better management and use of precursor (predictive) data, beyond the traditional accident and injury data currently used, and will lead to a safety learning culture that allows open disclosure about safety without the fear of adverse consequences. Although traditional rule-based systems have been effective at establishing minimum safety standards, we believe additional safety improvements can be made through safety enhancements such as risk reduction initiatives.\n\nFRA holds a leadership position from which it can encourage the adoption of risk reduction initiatives, without minimizing its safety compliance and oversight role. With the cooperation of senior leaders in railroad industry – FRA, labor organizations, and railroads – we hope to significantly reduce accidents and injuries. FRA’s long term objective in undertaking these efforts is to reduce reportable accidents and injuries by 50% within 10 years.",

          "answer": "Recognizing indicators of risk before an accident happens provides perhaps one of the greatest opportunities for improved safety and performance. In the past decade many different risk management programs have been implemented in various industries, with varying degrees of success. These programs, designed to systematically collect accident precursor data, reduce risk exposure through a corrective action program.\n\nThe RRP will provide a way for railroads, FRA, and labor organizations to learn about why unsafe events occur, without fear of blame or punishment. It is intended to provide a way for the railroad and its employees to identify the underlying conditions that contribute to the unsafe events rather than focusing only on the employee’s actions. It will also provide methods for employees to report events or safety conditions that could have harmful consequences, but didn’t, without risk of disciplinary action. When fully implemented, the RRP will identify systemic factors that can address multiple problems, and will identify, track, and evaluate corrective actions, and will make information that was previously hidden from view or unknown available for analysis and problem solving.",

Enforcement and compliance efforts have led to recent successes in reducing the numbers of accidents and injuries, and are expected to continue providing a baseline level of safety throughout the industry. FRA has determined, however, that it could build upon the traditional approach. Non-regulatory risk-based approaches present an opportunity to enhance safety beyond the baseline created by the current process. As the figure below illustrates conceptually, encouraging the adoption of new non-regulatory approaches to supplement regulatory approaches creates the opportunity for accelerated improvement. The combination of these two approaches will allow FRA to increase its impact and make more rapid progress in achieving its mission.",

In this report, the GAO recommended against the FRA adopting mandatory risk management approaches, saying that 'the agency is currently pursuing various initiatives to reduce train accident rates. In our view, these initiatives need time to mature to demonstrate their effects and, subsequently, an informed assessment would need to be made about whether additional actions are warranted.' In the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, however, Congress requires the FRA to develop a regulation that requires certain railroads to develop risk reduction programs, and to submit Risk Reduction Program Plans for FRA review and approval. At this time, the regulation is under development and will not be implemented until 2012.

They also involve objective data analysis to systematically identify safety risk factors, and recommendations to prevent or mitigate those identified risk factors in the future. RRP is different from SOFA and CAWG in that it seeks information about unsafe events or at-risk behaviors that have not yet resulted in harm to people, equipment or the environment. The RRP uses 'upstream' or predictive risk-related data, whereas SOFA and CAWG use past accidents to identify risk.

In the case of FRA’s PTC regulations, PTC must be designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zones, and movements of trains through switches left in the wrong position. How and with what technology a railroad reliably implements a PTC system is left for the railroad to decide.\n\nIt should be noted that the PTC statute also requires PTC systems to be interoperable, where interoperability means the ability to control locomotives of the host railroad and tenant railroad to communicate with and respond to the PTC system, including uninterrupted movements over property boundaries. Hence, although a host railroad may select the PTC technology it will use, the host railroad must also ensure that the PTC technology it implements is interoperable for all tenant railroads operating on the host’s infrastructure, and the onboard component of any railroad’s PTC system must be interoperable when operating as a tenant on other railroads’ infrastructure.",

          "question": "What does “reliably and functionally prevent” mean?",
          "answer": "The statutory mandate directed FRA to issue regulations “specifying in appropriate technical [detail the essential functionalities of positive train control systems.” Under 49 CFR § 236.1005, FRA outlines how a PTC system must be configured to be considered to reliably and functionally prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zones, and movements of trains through switches left in the wrong position.\n\nIn general, FRA regulations require the following actions to reliably and functionally execute the four required performance requirements of PTC:\n\n- Train-to-Train Collisions: To prevent collisions, PTC enforces a positive stop in many cases, and it enforces restricted speed in other cases. There are varying requirements associated with interlocking arrangements where one or more PTC routes intersect with one or more non-PTC routes. See 49 CFR § 236.1005(a)(1)(i), (f).\n\n- Overspeed Derailments: To prevent derailments caused by excessive speed, PTC is required to enforce civil speed limits, slow orders, and reduce excessive speeds over switches and through turnouts. See 49 CFR § 236.1005(a)(1)(ii).\n\n- Incursions into Established Work Zone Limits: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to a train entering an established work zone without first receiving appropriate authority and verification from the dispatcher or roadway worker. See 49 CFR § 236.1005(a)(1)(iii).\n\n- Movement of a Train through a Switch in the Improper Position: PTC is required to enforce restricted speed when a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train’s route in advance of the train’s movement, if there is a wayside or cab signal system. PTC is required to enforce a positive stop before any main line switch and any switch on certain sidings, when the switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train’s route in advance of the train’s movement, but only if the movement over the switch is made without the benefit of the indication of a wayside or cab signal system, or in a condition with unacceptable risk. See 49 CFR § 236.1005(a)(1)(iv), (e).\n\nAs each type of PTC system is designed differently, it may perform or execute the mandated functions in different manners, which FRA reviews and approves in the associated PTC Safety Plans to help ensure compliance. In addition, there are four certification classifications under 49 CFR § 236.1015(e)—i.e., a non-vital overlay system, a vital overlay system, a stand-alone system, and a mixed system. For example, a non-vital overlay PTC system is one that reliably executes the above functions and also is shown to obtain at least an 80% reduction of the risk associated with PTC-preventable accidents.",

          "question": "Does PTC prevent all of the four accident types where PTC is installed?",
          "answer": "PTC systems are designed (and implemented) to reliably and functionally prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zones, and movements of trains through switches left in the wrong position. However, there are some events where PTC, as designed, is not able to prevent an accident:\n\n- Train-to-train collisions at or below restricted speed: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to a train moving through a red signal. But there are operating rules that in some cases, allow a train to pass a red signal, with approval, at restricted speed. PTC will enforce the upper limit of restricted speed, which is 20 miles per hour (mph) or 15 mph, per the railroad’s operating rules. There have been some instances where a rear-end collision has occurred when a train is operating at or below restricted speed, when there was limited visibility, and the train operator did not operate the train ready to stop within one-half the range of vision.\n\n- Overspeed derailments at or below restricted speed: PTC is required to enforce civil speed limits, slow orders, and excessive speeds over switches and through turnouts. As noted above, PTC enforces the upper limit of restricted speed. However, PTC will not necessarily prevent an overspeed movement through a turnout within a restricted speed area if the maximum speed of the turnout is below the maximum restricted speed threshold.\n\n- Incursion into an established work zone: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to entering an established work zone. There have been several near-misses between a train and maintenance of way (MOW) workers when the MOW workers inadvertently located themselves outside the established work zone or, alternatively, did not properly establish a work zone.\n\n- Movement through a switch in the wrong position: PTC is required to enforce restricted speed when a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train’s route in advance of the train’s movement, if there is a wayside or cab signal system. As noted above, PTC enforces the upper limit of restricted speed. There have been some instances where a train has derailed due to the movement through a misaligned switch, noting that depending on visibility and terrain, the train operator must operate the train ready to stop within one-half the range of vision.\n\nFRA reminds the industry that Restricted speed means a speed that will permit a train or other equipment to stop within one-half the range of vision of the person operating the train or other equipment, but not exceeding 20 mph, unless further restricted by the operating rules of the railroad. 49 CFR §§ 236.812, 236.1003.",

          "question": "What types of accidents are not prevented by PTC?",
          "answer": "Most PTC systems are an overlay to the underlying signaling system and rely upon the signal system for train detection, interlocking control, and train routing. In the event of a failure of the signal system, PTC may not be able to continue to reliably perform. For example, in the event of a loss of shunt, specifically failure of track circuit train detection, the signal behind this failure may show proceed and a train in PTC could be at risk of a rear-end collision.\n\nFurther, PTC will protect only a correctly established work zone. FRA has seen incidents where a work zone was put into place incorrectly by the roadway worker in a split control point. FRA has also seen a situation where a roadway worker requested a work zone on the wrong main track. PTC will enforce only the work zone put in place by the dispatcher. If the work zone is requested in the wrong location, PTC will enforce the established work zone, not the 'intended' work zone. FRA reminds the industry that following established procedures and being knowledgeable of the track layout and any unique locations, such as split control points, when requesting a work zone is paramount to PTC protecting the work zone.",

The PTCDP is the core document that enables FRA to determine whether the proposed PTC system could, if implemented, meet the statutory and regulatory requirements. If FRA approves a PTCDP for a particular system, FRA may issue that system a Type Approval, which other railroads using the same system may rely on.\n\n- A PTC Implementation Plan (PTCIP) is prepared by each host railroad subject to the PTC regulations that documents, among other things, where a PTC system must be installed, the sequence of installation, and how each applicable tenant railroad will achieve PTC system interoperability.\n\n- A PTC Safety Plan (PTCSP) is prepared by each host railroad to reflect the as-built PTC system and document the design, the system hazards and risks, and the system safety analysis, as well as a range of other information such as the railroad’s approach to testing, verification and validation, configuration management, training, and records management.",

However, FRA’s PTC regulations and the statutory mandate recognize that PTC technology may sometimes experience failures and be disabled.\n\nDisabling a PTC system without permission or circumventing a PTC enforcement is subject to civil penalty or disqualification for the responsible locomotive engineer or conductor. When PTC is disabled, the PTC system is unable to initiate the brakes to prevent a train-to-train collision, over-speed derailment, incursion into an established work zone, or the movement of a train through a switch left in the wrong position.\n\nIn 2023 and beyond, the only time a railroad may lawfully operate on PTC-mandated territory without a functioning PTC system is if the PTC system has failed en route, including malfunctions and other cut outs. In the instance of a PTC failure en route, the train may operate, with speed limitations, no farther than the next forward designed location for the repair or exchange of onboard PTC apparatuses.

Such data supported railroads’ PTCSPs and FRA’s certification of each host railroad’s PTC system.\n\nFRA continues to oversee the performance and reliability of PTC technology by reviewing, for example, failure-related notifications that railroads, vendors, and suppliers submit under 49 CFR § 236.1023, Errors and malfunctions. Of particular note is the requirement to notify FRA, within 15 days of discovery of a failure, malfunction or defective condition that decreased or eliminated the safety functionality. This notification must, in general, provide specific details regarding the failure, malfunction or defective condition, the status of measures to rectify, and any countermeasures to mitigate the condition. FRA tracks these reports, performs inspections to validate rectification of the conditions and performs audits of railroads’ compliance with its processes and procedures to monitor, report and rectify PTC failures, malfunctions, and defective conditions.\n\nNotably, railroads must also submit Quarterly Reports of PTC System Performance (Form FRA F 6180.152, OMB Control No. 2130-0553)—pursuant to FRA’s PTC regulations and 49 U.S.C. § 20157(m).

Before a railroad can make certain changes to an FRA-certified PTC system or the associated FRA-approved PTCSP, a host railroad must submit, and obtain FRA’s approval of, a request for amendment (RFA) to its PTCSP under 49 CFR § 236.1021.\n\nFRA’s regulations at 49 CFR § 236.1021(h) identify the types of proposed changes that trigger the filing of an RFA to a railroad’s PTC system and PTCSP. Specifically, a railroad is required to submit this type of RFA, for FRA’s review and approval, if the railroad seeks to:\n\n- Modify a safety-critical element of its PTC system; or\n- Modify its PTC system in a way that would affect the safety-critical functionality of any other PTC system with which it interoperates.\n\nFRA’s regulations provide, under 49 CFR § 236.1021(e), that FRA will publish a notice in the Federal Register and invite public comment on these RFAs. As such, the public has an opportunity to review a railroad’s incoming RFA and submit comments to FRA during the timeframe specified in the Federal Register notice.

In its own PTCSP, each host railroad must provide a complete description of the 'as built' PTC system with its associated safety case, as each host railroad’s operating environment, design choices, and ongoing operation and maintenance procedures may vary.\n\nFollowing notice-and-comment, FRA modified its PTC regulations in July 2021, among other reasons, to permit host railroads utilizing the same type of PTC system, with the same certification classification, to submit joint RFAs to their PTCSPs and PTC Development Plans. Appreciating that changes to safety-critical elements, including software or system architecture, of a certain PTC system will likely impact multiple, if not most, railroads operating that same type of PTC system, 49 CFR § 236.1021(l) and (m) outline specific instructions for such host railroads to submit joint RFAs. FRA recognizes that modifying and simplifying the process for host railroads to submit RFAs to PTCSPs for FRA-certified PTC systems is necessary to facilitate required maintenance and upgrades to PTC technology and encourage railroads to enhance their PTC systems to continue to improve rail safety.",

The focus and level of detail of cost-benefit comparison will vary by track. Tracks 1 – 3 should demonstrate the benefits of the proposed project – each track consecutively requires more detail; beginning with, at the minimum, a qualitative description of the benefits for Track 1 (Planning), and progressing to a quantitative Benefit-Cost-Analysis for FD/Construction projects eligible for Track 3. In some cases, Track 1 and Track 2 applications may include development or improvement of quantitative Benefit-Cost-Analyses.

For rail, safety benefits usually come in the form of diverting freight traffic away from trucks and diverting passenger traffic away from personal vehicles, which are both less safe. An increase or decrease in risk-level specific to an activity (for example crude and other hazmat by rail) can be also considered, but can be difficult to quantify.",

In general, agglomeration effects should be handled qualitatively and only treated in the BCA narrative sections. If an applicant has sufficient local data at the necessary level to attempt to quantify these types of benefits, they may do so, but they are also strongly cautioned to make sure that they are indeed capturing new benefits not covered under other subheadings.

In general, there are no general O&M cost categories that apply only to rail projects, and all O&M costs associated with the project should be included.\n\nIf a project is a new construction, all ongoing costs that are required to maintain the project over its lifetime should be included in cost calculations. However, for projects that will rehabilitate, modify, or improve existing track, equipment, structures, or facilities, etc., there are often O&M cost reductions or increases as a result.

A crossing is further defined as including those tracks that lie within a pair of warning devices.' Thus, an intersection of a roadway with 3 tracks (2 mainline and 1 spur) where the mainline tracks have flashing lights and the spur has crossbucks, would actually be two crossings with two separate crossing inventory numbers.\n\nFor a public crossing, the roadway must be part of the general system of public roads, and under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public highway authority, and open to the general traveling public.

          "question": "Who is responsible for closing a crossing and how is it done? Also, if a crossing is closed, can it be reopened?",
          "answer": "Closing a crossing is a very simple process. Normally, it will be the Railroad that is responsible for closing a crossing, but it may be performed by the State for Public crossings if the State does a site visit and finds the crossing closed. The closing can be effected by completing an Inventory Form, or printing a copy of the current record from the Safetydata Website and indicating that it is 'Closed' with the Effective Date. A default Effective Date would be the date of notification to FRA. Alternatively, an Excel File or a simple list of the crossing numbers to be closed can be provided via email or in a letter. Again, be sure to include the Effective Date of the closure. If the actual date is unknown, a reasonable guess is sufficient.\n\nA crossing that is closed remains in the National File forever. The crossing number remains with that location forever, and the number cannot be reused at a different location. A crossing that is closed can be reopened at any time in the future by simply notifying FRA and providing updated information. When a Railroad sells or transfers a rail-line with crossings to a different Operating Railroad, it needs to transfer the crossings to the new Operating Railroad and not submit them as closed, even though they might show them as closed in their railroad’s inventory file.",

          "question": "Who needs to provide Latitude/Longitude (GPS) data and in what format?",
          "answer": "Both States and Railroads need to provide GPS data. The States have the responsibility for providing it for all existing open Public at-grade crossings, including those that are grade-separated and Pathway (Pedestrian). The Railroads are responsible for providing GPS data for all Private crossings and any Pedestrian crossings that are private. However, for new or un-inventoried crossings, it is the responsibility of the Railroad to obtain and provide this information when they create the 'new' crossing Inventory Form. By design, for a 'new' crossing, the data cannot be input into the National File without all of the information on the Form for the crossing.\n\nThe FRA Office of Safety uses the WGS-84 (World Geodetic System 1984) datum standard. The National Inventory File requires Latitude and Longitude to be submitted in 'Degrees.Digital Degrees' (DDD) format. The coordinates are to be measured at the center of the highway-rail crossing. The measurement values are to be entered in decimal (DDD) format as (nn.nnnnnnn) for Latitude and as (-nnn.nnnnnnn) for Longitude. The values need to be taken to seven (7) decimal places. Additional information is located on the Inventory Program Webpage under the section on 'Inventory Updating and Database Reconciliation Processes' at http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/content/801, which includes conversion from the 'Degrees.Minutes.Seconds' (DMS) format.",

In such cases, each track crossing with its own pair of warning devices, even if they are the same devices, needs to have a crossing number assigned. \n\nThe determination as to whether or not there should be a pair of warning devices covering all tracks or a pair for each track should be determined by an engineering diagnostic study and will depend on the storage distances and the type of vehicles using the crossing. Usually, a track separation of 100 feet or more will require separate pairs of warning devices and separate crossing inventory numbers.",

For a Pathway (or Pedestrian) crossing to be considered separate from the highway-rail crossing, it must be at least 25 feet from the roadway and be explicitly distinct.

The Federal lead agency or the Secretary (when a Federal lead agency has not been identified) must provide a written response to the project sponsor no later than 45 days after the date on which it receives a project initiation notice (see 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(3)). The written response must either: (1) describe the determination to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process or to decline the application with an explanation for that decision; or (2) request additional information necessary to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process. The Agencies recommend contacting the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) to discuss the proposed project’s details and the Federal lead agency’s preferences before formally submitting the project notification.\n\nWhen submitting a project initiation notice, a project sponsor must continue to provide the project’s type of work, termini, length, general location, and anticipated Federal approvals. However, section 1304(e)(1) clarifies that the project sponsor may provide any additional information it considers important when it proposes to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process for the proposed project. 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(1).\n\n**Request to Designate a Lead Agency**\nSection 1304(e)(2) also establishes a new 'lead agency designation' process (see 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4)). Under this process, a project sponsor may submit a request to the Secretary to designate the operating administration or secretarial office within U.S. DOT with the expertise on the proposed project to serve as the Federal lead agency. The Secretary must respond to the request no later than 45 days after the date of receipt of the request. The response must:\n\n- Approve or deny the request. If the Secretary denies the request, the response must include an explanation for the denial; or\n- Require the project sponsor to submit additional information. If the project sponsor submits additional information, then the Secretary must respond to the submission no later than 45 days after the date of the receipt of the new information.\n\nAlthough project sponsors have the option to request a lead agency designation from the Secretary under 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4), the Agencies recommend that project sponsors first contact the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) (i.e., FHWA, FRA, or FTA) to discuss the project. Where a lead agency is not readily identified, the Agencies will informally consult with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy (OST). For most projects, informal discussions with the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) will result in the identification of the Federal lead agency without using the formal designation process.

The provision allows lead agencies to eliminate from detailed consideration an alternative proposed in an EIS if the lead agency determines the following conditions are met:\n\n- The alternative was considered in a metropolitan planning process or a State environmental review process by a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) or a State or local transportation agency, as applicable;\n\n- The lead agency provided guidance to the MPO or State or local transportation agency, as applicable, regarding the analysis of alternatives in the metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process, including guidance on the NEPA requirements and any other Federal law necessary for approval of the project;\n\n- The applicable metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process included an opportunity for public review and comment;\n\n- The applicable MPO or State or local transportation agency rejected the alternative after considering public comments;\n\n- The Federal lead agency independently reviewed the alternative evaluation approved by the applicable MPO or State or local transportation agency; and\n\n- The Federal lead agency determined:\n\n  - In consultation with Federal participating or cooperating agencies, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for compliance with NEPA; or\n\n  - With the concurrence of Federal agencies with jurisdiction over a permit or approval required for a project, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for any permit or approval under any other Federal law. The Federal lead agency will provide this determination to the Federal agencies with jurisdiction over a permit or approval required for the project.

          "question": "What does the rule mean by 'existing freight operations?'",
          "answer": "- 'Existing freight operations' on a track means that the track is used at the present time by regular freight rail traffic (i.e., revenue freight trains carrying goods or returning from delivering goods on behalf of shippers).\n\n- Use of one or more tracks passing through a station and adjacent to a platform for other purposes (including but not limited to use of maintenance equipment by a freight railroad, the rare or token passage of freight trains, storage of ballast cars, movement of private passenger cars, or use of tracks to park freight trains overnight) does not constitute 'existing freight operations' because these activities do not meet any plausible definition of 'freight rail traffic.'\n\n- In addition, where stations serve lines shared by passenger and freight traffic, and a freight train can bypass the track adjacent to the new or altered passenger platform via a gauntlet or other available track such that the freight train does not need to use the track adjacent to the platform, level-entry boarding is required. This means that even if freight trains could access a track adjacent to a passenger platform via a diverging track or other access point but does not have to do so because other tracks exist for freight passage through the station, level entry boarding is required. This also means that track adjacent to a passenger platform track that would be accessed via a diverging move off the main freight line would never be construed to carry freight rail traffic, and therefore, level-entry boarding is always required at such a platform.\n\n- If more than one platform exists in the station and the station has multiple tracks available to freight trains, only a platform adjacent to a track actually used for freight rail traffic would not need to provide level-entry boarding. Other platforms at the station must provide level-entry boarding.\n\n- The possibility that a freight railroad could use a track for freight rail traffic at some time in the future does not mean that there are 'existing' freight operations.\n\n- Where freight trains have not used a track passing through a station for a significant length of time (e.g., as noted in the Preamble to the rule, 10 years), the Department treats the situation as not constituting 'existing' freight operations. However, entities should be aware that the example provided of '10 years' is as an illustration only. There may be occasions when a railroad not using tracks for freight train service over a period of less than 10 years would still constitute a significant length of time, depending on all the circumstances—e.g., when a freight customer no longer exists for a particular line. In such a case, the Department would regard the track as not being used for 'existing' freight traffic on that track.",

If a Project Sponsor does not follow the SOP, Project Sponsors will need to coordinate separately with FRA and FTA, meet each agencies’ independent requirements, and otherwise maintain two separate oversight processes.

          "answer": "FRA and FTA believe that a risk-based approach will maximize the efficient use of project management and oversight resources on Multimodal-Funded Major Capital Projects by eliminating redundant administrative procedures and focusing resources on complex real property acquisitions. A risk-based approach means that FRA and FTA will identify, assess, and understand on a case-by-case basis the risk that a Project or a particular acquisition may not meet URA requirements. FRA and FTA will use this approach instead of reviewing each facet of all real property acquisitions. An evaluation of risk will be determined at the discretion of the Cognizant Federal Agency, which may include such factors as: the number and complexity of transactions; the number and complexity of relocations; the level of sophistication of the grantee’s acquisition team; or the grantee’s record of URA compliance.

Project Sponsors and Project Partners that do not acquire real property in accordance with the Real Property SOP RAMP requirements, or do not simultaneously follow FRA and FTA real property acquisition and NEPA requirements prior to acquisition, risk the reimbursement eligibility of the cost of the acquisition and the possibility that the real property acquired may not be eligible for use.",

Depending on the circumstances, the Cognizant Federal Agency may increase or decrease the number of acquisition files for review throughout the project lifecycle.

For example, safety benefits for a highway project usually take the form of reduced accidents or reduction of accident severity. For rail, safety benefits usually come in the form of diverting freight traffic away from trucks and diverting passenger traffic away from personal vehicles, which are both less safe. An increase or decrease in risk-level specific to an activity (for example crude and other hazmat by rail) can be also considered, but can be difficult to quantify.",

In general, agglomeration effects should be handled qualitatively and only treated in the BCA narrative sections. If an applicant has sufficient local data at the necessary level to attempt to quantify these types of benefits, they may do so, but they are also strongly cautioned to make sure that they are indeed capturing new benefits not covered under other subheadings. Double counting of benefits is not allowed. If private or local data is used to justify benefits, please include that data in an appendix to the BCA.",

          "question": "What is the minimum width needed for a non-level boarding railroad passenger station platform to meet the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?",
          "answer": "Under 49 CFR Part 37, all new or altered railroad station platforms, including non-level boarding platforms, used for intercity rail passenger service or commuter rail passenger service must be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including persons who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or walkers. 49 CFR 37.9, 37.41-37.43, 37.55. We have received questions from entities constructing or altering platforms regarding the minimum platform width needed to accommodate passengers using such mobility aid devices. This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for non-level boarding platforms.\n\nWhere non-level boarding platforms exist, on-board lifts may be used to move passengers who cannot climb stairs from the platform level up to the passenger car. 49 CFR 37.165(g). The actual design of the platform lift mechanism varies from one builder to another, but it is not uncommon for the passenger car edge of the lift platform in the fully deployed position to be a number of inches away from the actual side of the passenger car body. An allowance of 1 foot from the side of the passenger car to the edge of the lift platform has been made to accommodate various lifting mechanism designs. The lifting platform cannot be more than 3 inches above the platform in the down position with a connecting ramp slope not exceeding 1:8 (49 CFR 38.95(b)(8), 38.125(b)(8)), which could result in a ramp to the lift platform being a maximum of 24 inches long. Per section 304.3 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a person using a wheelchair to turn and enter the on-board lift.\n\nFor a new or altered conventional non-level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width thus should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above – 12 feet.\n\nFor a non-level boarding end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 14 feet for an end loading island platform.\n\nFor a non-level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalator, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access feature (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42 for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet.

We have received questions from entities constructing or altering platforms as to the minimum platform width needed to accommodate passengers using such mobility aid devices. This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for level boarding platforms.\n\nA level boarding intercity or commuter railroad passenger station platform can have a gap between the passenger car door threshold and the edge of the platform that is at the maximum horizontal dimension of 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and a maximum vertical dimension of 5.5 inches. 49 CFR 37.42(f). At level boarding platforms, where the gap exceeds plus or minus 5/8 inch vertical or 3 inches horizontal (49 CFR 37.42(f)), a bridge plate is typically used to allow a passenger using a wheelchair or other mobility device to move from the platform to the passenger car. While they can vary in dimensions, a typical bridge plate is approximately 3 feet long. Per ADAAG 304.3, a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a passenger using a wheelchair to make a turn to enter the bridge plate and onto the passenger car.\n\nFor a conventional level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or a wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above – i.e., 8 feet.\n\nFor an end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 10 feet for an end loading level boarding island platform.\n\nFor a level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalators, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access facility (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42(e)(1) for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet. The level boarding island with vertical pedestrian access platform may be tapered to 10 feet at the end(s) of the platform, as long as the gap between the car and the platform through the curved portion complies with 49 CFR 37.42(f), which defines the maximum allowable gap at level boarding platforms to be 10 inches on tangent and 13 inches on curved tracks.\n\nCircumstances may arise where a 15-inch high passenger platform designed to provide level boarding to typical bi-level passenger cars is also used by conventional single level passenger cars, which typically have 51-inch car door heights. In this case, the 3 feet allocated for a bridge plate should be replaced by either the 5 feet used by an on-board lift or 4 feet used by a platform mounted lift. Thus, a 15-inch high platform used by single level passenger cars should be treated as if it were a non-level boarding platform.",

Normal maintenance . . . painting . . . or changes to mechanical or electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.”\n\nIn the context of a railroad station platform, maintenance and repair activities, such as painting or fixing cracks, would generally not constitute an alteration. Adding accessibility features that do not affect the basic configuration of or access to the platform (e.g., adding a detectable warning strip along a platform edge, installing a public address system or visual paging system) would also not constitute an alteration.\n\nChanges that do affect the basic configuration of a platform or the ability of people with disabilities to have access to the platform would constitute an alteration.\n\nFor example, if the platform height relative to the top of rail is raised, if the old surface is removed and/or a new surface put down, or if there is a reconstruction of or structural change to the platform that affects its usability (e.g., to remedy significant degrading of the facility), there would be an alteration.",

          "question": "What does the rule mean by 'existing freight operations'?",
          "answer": "“Existing freight operations” on a track means that the track is used at the present time by regular freight rail traffic (i.e., revenue freight trains carrying goods or returning from delivering goods on behalf of shippers).\n\nUse of one or more tracks passing through a station and adjacent to a platform for other purposes (including but not limited to use of maintenance equipment by a freight railroad, the rare or token passage of freight trains, storage of ballast cars, movement of private passenger cars, or use of tracks to park freight trains overnight) does not constitute “existing freight operations” because these activities do not meet any plausible definition of “freight rail traffic.”\n\nIn addition, where stations serve lines shared by passenger and freight traffic, and a freight train can bypass the track adjacent to the new or altered passenger platform via a gauntlet or other available track such that the freight train does not need to use the track adjacent to the platform, level-entry boarding is required. This means that even if freight trains could access a track adjacent to a passenger platform via a diverging track or other access point but does not have to do so because other tracks exist for freight passage through the station, level-entry boarding is required. This also means that track adjacent to a passenger platform track that would be accessed via a diverging move off the main freight line would never be construed to carry freight rail traffic, and therefore, level-entry boarding is always required at such a platform.\n\nIf more than one platform exists in the station and the station has multiple tracks available to freight trains, only a platform adjacent to a track actually used for freight rail traffic would not need to provide level-entry boarding. Other platforms at the station must provide level-entry boarding.\n\nThe possibility that a freight railroad could use a track for freight rail traffic at some time in the future does not mean that there are “existing” freight operations.\n\nWhere freight trains have not used a track passing through a station for a significant length of time (e.g., as noted in the Preamble to the rule, 10 years), the Department treats the situation as not constituting “existing” freight operations. However, entities should be aware that the example provided of “10 years” is as an illustration only. There may be occasions when a railroad not using tracks for freight train service over a period of less than 10 years would still constitute a significant length of time, depending on all the circumstances—e.g., when a freight customer no longer exists for a particular line. In such a case, the Department would regard the track as not being used for “existing” freight traffic on that track.",

Plans for meeting the performance standard at new or altered stations where track adjacent to the platform is shared with freight traffic must be submitted on a station-by-station basis.\n\nThat is, there must be a separate plan for each such station. It is not sufficient to have a generic plan for a line or a system.\n\nWhile there may well be common features of a railroad’s plans for various stations in its system, there are also likely to be differences among stations. The design and layout of stations, the number of trains that stop at the station, the passenger volume at the station, whether there are other railroads that use the station, and other factors are likely to vary from station to station. Station plans need to take these variables into account at each station.\n\nIn reviewing station plans, FRA and FTA intend to give particular scrutiny to larger, more complex, stations and those with higher passenger volumes to ensure that the railroad’s plan will fully meet the performance standard in practice.",

          "answer": "Public entities, such as Amtrak and commuter operators, must construct a new facility for use in designated public transportation so that it is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.41(a)). Likewise, when a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of such a facility, the entity must make the alterations in such a way that the altered part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.43(a)(1)). This latter requirement also specifically applies to alterations of an intercity or commuter rail station by its owner, the “responsible person” for the station, or a person in control of the station (see sec. 37.43(a)(3)).\n\nA transportation facility is considered to be accessible if it meets the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG; see 36 CFR Part 1191, including Appendices B and D), as modified by Appendix A to Part 37.\n\nAppendix A to Part 37 (see section 801.5.3) provides that low-level platforms in rail stations must be at least 8 inches above top of rail (ATR). We note that there may be rare situations in which meeting this requirement is impracticable (e.g., there is a highway grade crossing intersecting the platform). FRA and/or FTA will address such unusual situations on a case-by-case basis, as needed.\n\nBecause of these requirements, when an intercity or commuter railroad constructs or alters a platform, it must ensure the platform is at least 8 inches ATR. Note that alterations to parts of a station other than the platform do not trigger this requirement.\n\nIn addition to this basic facility accessibility requirement, section 37.42 requires a railroad that alters a station platform and does not provide level boarding to ensure that passengers with disabilities can board any accessible car of a train available to other passengers at that station, using means including car-borne lifts, station-based lifts, or mini-high platforms. Meeting this requirement does not exempt the railroad from the separate requirement to ensure that an altered or newly constructed platform is at least 8 inches ATR.\n\nWhile a platform 8 inches above ATR generally does not provide level boarding, a platform at this height does facilitate boarding by ambulatory passengers, including passengers (e.g., elderly persons) who might have difficulty ascending a vertical distance greater than the normal vertical gap between an 8-inch ATR platform and the first step of a railroad car.",

          "question": "Where the requirements of section 37.42 apply, which cars of a train does a railroad operator have to make available to passengers with disabilities?",
          "answer": "The performance standard of section 37.42(a) requires that passengers with disabilities “must have access to all accessible cars available to passengers without disabilities in each train using the station.\n\nThe standard applies only to “accessible” cars meeting the requirements of 49 CFR Part 38. Some railroads continue to operate a number of inaccessible cars (e.g., 1950s-era double-decker commuter cars) that people with mobility impairments cannot enter and use. The requirement does not apply to cars of this kind.\n\nMoreover, the standard applies only to “cars available to passengers without disabilities” at a given station. There can be a number of situations in which not all cars in a train are made available to anyone at a station.\n\nFor example, at a station with a relatively short platform, only cars 1-4 of an 8-car train may be available to any passenger. In some commuter rail systems, only two cars are open to be boarded by any passenger at a station.\n\nIn situations like these, only those cars that are made available to other passengers at the station have to be made available to passengers with disabilities. The railroad operator generally would not be required to make cars available to passengers with disabilities that are not made available to other passengers.\n\nHowever, if all wheelchair locations are occupied by other wheelchair users in cars where the doors normally open at a station, the Department expects the railroad operator to double-stop or move a lift, where necessary, in order to provide transportation to a wheelchair user in an unoccupied wheelchair location. (Of course, railroad operators are always responsible for moving passengers’ luggage and other items out of wheelchair locations to permit their use by a wheelchair user.) Likewise, if the only way a passenger with a disability can access a food service car is through an adjacent car, then the railroad should provide access to the adjacent car.",

Such costs are allowable only to the extent that they would have been allowable if incurred after the date of the Federal award and only with the written approval of the Federal awarding agency. If charged to the award, these costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the award, unless otherwise specified by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.\n\nAll Advance Costs are incurred at a Project Sponsor’s risk and the pre-obligation approval of Advance Cost incurrence does not commit FRA to reimburse such costs; only costs properly requested that are otherwise consistent with the terms of the executed grant agreement would be eligible for reimbursement or could be used as match.\n\nApproval of Advance Cost incurrence is not a legal or implied commitment that the subject project will be selected for FRA assistance or that FRA will obligate Federal funds.
