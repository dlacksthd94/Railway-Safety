                "answer": "Yes. The engineer certification regulation requires that anyone who moves a locomotive must be certified. There are two exceptions: 1) when operating a locomotive(s) within the confines of a locomotive repair or servicing area (no cars attached); and 2) when moving a locomotive(s) for distances of less than 100 feet for inspection and maintenance purposes.",

The design and layout of stations, the number of trains that stop at the station, the passenger volume at the station, whether there are other railroads that use the station, and other factors are likely to vary from station to station. Station plans need to take these variables into account at each station.\n\n- In reviewing station plans, FRA and FTA intend to give particular scrutiny to larger, more complex, stations and those with higher passenger volumes to ensure that the railroad\u2019s plan will fully meet the performance standard in practice.",

The requirement does not apply to cars of this kind.\n\n- Moreover, the standard applies only to \u201ccars available to passengers without disabilities\u201d at a given station. There can be a number of situations in which not all cars in a train are made available to anyone at a station.\n\n- For example, at a station with a relatively short platform, only cars 1-4 of an 8-car train may be available to any passenger. In some commuter rail systems, only two cars are open to be boarded by any passenger at a station.\n\n- In situations like these, only those cars that are made available to other passengers at the station have to be made available to passengers with disabilities. The railroad operator generally would not be required to make cars available to passengers with disabilities that are not made available to other passengers.\n\n- However, if all wheelchair locations are occupied by other wheelchair users in cars where the doors normally open at a station, the Department expects the railroad operator to double-stop or move a lift, where necessary, in order to provide transportation to a wheelchair user in an unoccupied wheelchair location. (Of course, railroad operators are always responsible for moving passengers\u2019 luggage and other items out of wheelchair locations to permit their use by a wheelchair user.) Likewise, if the only way a passenger with a disability can access a food service car is through an adjacent car, then the railroad should provide access to the adjacent car.",

                "question": "When a rail operator constructs a new station platform or alters an existing station platform, does 49 CFR Part 37 require the rail operator ensure that the platform is at least 8 inches above top of rail, even if the railroad operator will provide accessibility consistent with the requirements of Section 37.42?",
                "answer": "- Public entities, such as Amtrak and commuter operators, must construct a new facility for use in designated public transportation so that it is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.41(a)). Likewise, when a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of such a facility, the entity must make the alterations in such a way that the altered part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.43(a)(1)). This latter requirement also specifically applies to alterations of an intercity or commuter rail station by its owner, the 'responsible person' for the station, or a person in control of the station (see sec. 37.43(a)(3)).\n\n- A transportation facility is considered to be accessible if it meets the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG; see 36 CFR Part 1191, including Appendices B and D), as modified by Appendix A to Part 37.\n\n- Appendix A to Part 37 (see section 801.5.3) provides that low-level platforms in rail stations must be at least 8 inches above top of rail (ATR). We note that there may be rare situations in which meeting this requirement is impracticable (e.g., there is a highway grade crossing intersecting the platform). FRA and/or FTA will address such unusual situations on a case-by-case basis, as needed.\n\n- Because of these requirements, when an intercity or commuter railroad constructs or alters a platform, it must ensure the platform is at least 8 inches ATR. Note that alterations to parts of a station other than the platform do not trigger this requirement.\n\n- In addition to this basic facility accessibility requirement, section 37.42 requires a railroad that alters a station platform and does not provide level boarding to ensure that passengers with disabilities can board any accessible car of a train available to other passengers at that station, using means including car-borne lifts, station-based lifts, or mini-high platforms. Meeting this requirement does not exempt the railroad from the separate requirement to ensure that an altered or newly constructed platform is at least 8 inches ATR.\n\n- While a platform 8 inches above ATR generally does not provide level boarding, a platform at this height does facilitate boarding by ambulatory passengers, including passengers (e.g., elderly persons) who might have difficulty ascending a vertical distance greater than the normal vertical gap between an 8-inch ATR platform and the first step of a railroad car.",

                "question": "What is the difference among the terms denial of certification, denial of recertification and revocation?",
                "answer": "- Denial of certification refers to the situation in which a person who is not a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not grant the person initial certification. A railroad might choose to deny a person certification if the railroad decides that the person, despite having finished a railroad-approved training program, cannot pass all of the minimum requirements. For example, the person may not have passed the skills performance or knowledge tests, or the person did not meet the minimum hearing and vision requirements. The rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying certification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Denial of recertification refers to the situation in which a person who is a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not be renewing the person\u2019s certificate when it is due to expire. The regulations require that railroads renew a certificate at least every three (3) years. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.217(c) and 242.201(c). Like a denial of certification, a denial of recertification may be based on a person\u2019s inability to meet any of the minimum requirements and the rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying recertification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Certificate revocation refers to the situation in which the railroad determines that a certified locomotive engineer or conductor either (1) has violated a cardinal operating rule or practice [as specified in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.117(e) and 242.403(e)] or (2) is ineligible to hold a certificate due to a substance abuse disorder or violations of FRA\u2019s alcohol and drug regulations. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.119 and 242.115. Prior to revoking a person\u2019s certificate, the regulations require a railroad to provide the certified engineer or conductor with 'the opportunity for a hearing;' however, that opportunity can be waived. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.307 and 242.407.",

See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.403(c). A person who has been denied a conductor certification or recertification has 120 days from the date of the railroad\u2019s decision to file a petition, however the Board may extend the filing period for cause shown (see below). 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.503(c).\n\n- CERTIFICATE REVOCATION: A person has 120 days from the date of the railroad\u2019s revocation decision to file a petition. See 49 C.F.R. 240.403(d) and 242.503(c).\n\n- In computing the 180[th] or 120[th] day, please do not count the date the railroad\u2019s decision was issued. Also, please be advised that the date the railroad issued its decision may be earlier than the date you received or were served with a copy of that decision.\n\n- If the 180[th] or 120[th] day falls on a day that the Docket Clerk\u2019s office is closed [i.e., a Saturday, a Sunday or Federal holiday] you must file your request before the end of the next day in which the Docket Clerk\u2019s office is open and accessible.

                "answer": "- Late petitions will be denied as untimely except that the Board for cause shown may extend the petition filing period at any time in its discretion:\n\n(1) Provided the request for extension is filed before the deadline; or\n(2) Provided that the failure to timely file was the result of excusable neglect. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.403(d) and 242.503(c).\n\n- Thus, a person who has not missed the deadline can file a request for an extension knowing that the Board has wide discretion to grant the request. See 64 Fed. Reg. 60966, 60983 (Nov. 8, 1999). Such a petitioner needs to demonstrate some justification for the Board to grant the extension as the regulation requires cause to be shown. Moreover, it is recommended that a petitioner specify how much additional time will be needed to file the petition keeping in mind that only reasonable requests will be granted.\n\n- If the deadline has already passed, the petitioner must allege the facts constituting \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d and the mere assertion of excusable neglect unsupported by facts is insufficient. Excusable neglect requires a demonstration of good faith on the part of the party seeking an extension of time and some reasonable basis for noncompliance with the time specified in the rules. In most cases, demonstrating justification requires sending the Board evidence substantiating the reason an extension is needed along with any explanation. Absent a showing along these lines, relief will likely be denied.",

More detailed instructions for submitting acceptable requests for an administrative hearing are answered in response to the next question. Please note that for locomotive engineer cases this office is different than the filing address for the earlier Board review. DO NOT FILE YOUR REQUEST FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING WITH FRA\u2019S DOCKET CLERK - it will only delay the actual filing with the appropriate office listed above. Conductor cases will retain the same docket.\n\n- Background Information: When an administrative hearing is requested, a new docket for a locomotive engineer case is created that will be completely available electronically. While you should reference the FRA docket number used for the Board\u2019s review in your engineer submission, your administrative hearing docket submission will not be put into that FRA docket created just for the Board\u2019s review.\n\n- As the docket will be available electronically to the public, FRA recommends that each party be careful to redact Social Security numbers, employee identification numbers that may be the same as a Social Security number, or any other information that is private in nature and should not be shared with the general public.",

If you are represented by an attorney or any other representative, you must also provide the same basic information for that person.\n\n(2) The specific factual issues, industry rules, regulations, or laws that the requesting party alleges need to be examined in connection with the certification decision in question. Please note that this proceeding provides an aggrieved party a de novo hearing at which the relevant facts can be adduced and the correct application of Parts 240 or 242 can be applied. This proceeding does not provide an appellate review of the Board\u2019s decision or the railroad\u2019s hearing; thus, the administrative proceeding will not cover alleged procedural errors which may have occurred at those earlier proceedings.

                "question": "What is the difference among the terms denial of certification, denial of recertification and revocation?",
                "answer": "- Denial of certification refers to the situation in which a person who is not a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not grant the person initial certification. A railroad might choose to deny a person certification if the railroad decides that the person, despite having finished a railroad-approved training program, cannot pass all of the minimum requirements. For example, the person may not have passed the skills performance or knowledge tests, or the person did not meet the minimum hearing and vision requirements. The rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying certification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Denial of recertification refers to the situation in which a person who is a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not be renewing the person\u2019s certificate when it is due to expire. The regulations require that railroads renew a certificate at least every three (3) years. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.217(c) and 242.201(c). Like a denial of certification, a denial of recertification may be based on a person\u2019s inability to meet any of the minimum requirements and the rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying recertification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Certificate revocation refers to the situation in which the railroad determines that a certified locomotive engineer or conductor either (1) has violated a cardinal operating rule or practice [as specified in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.117(e) and 242.403(e)] or (2) is ineligible to hold a certificate due to a substance abuse disorder or violations of FRA\u2019s alcohol and drug regulations. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.119 and 242.115. Prior to revoking a person\u2019s certificate, the regulations require a railroad to provide the certified engineer or conductor with \u201cthe opportunity for a hearing;\u201d however, that opportunity can be waived. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.307 and 242.407.",

See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.403(c). A person who has been denied a conductor certification or recertification has 120 days from the date of the railroad\u2019s decision to file a petition, however the Board may extend the filing period for cause shown (see below). 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.503(c).\n\n- CERTIFICATE REVOCATION: A person has 120 days from the date of the railroad\u2019s revocation decision to file a petition. See 49 C.F.R. 240.403(d) and 242.503(c).\n\n- In computing the 180[th] or 120[th] day, please do not count the date the railroad\u2019s decision was issued. Also, please be advised that the date the railroad issued its decision may be earlier than the date you received or were served with a copy of that decision.\n\n- If the 180[th] or 120[th] day falls on a day that the Docket Clerk\u2019s office is closed [i.e., a Saturday, a Sunday or Federal holiday] you must file your request before the end of the next day in which the Docket Clerk\u2019s office is open and accessible.

                "answer": "- Late petitions will be denied as untimely except that the Board for cause shown may extend the petition filing period at any time in its discretion:\n\n(1) Provided the request for extension is filed before the deadline; or\n(2) Provided that the failure to timely file was the result of excusable neglect. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.403(d) and 242.503(c).\n\n- Thus, a person who has not missed the deadline can file a request for an extension knowing that the Board has wide discretion to grant the request. See 64 Fed. Reg. 60966, 60983 (Nov. 8, 1999). Such a petitioner needs to demonstrate some justification for the Board to grant the extension as the regulation requires cause to be shown. Moreover, it is recommended that a petitioner specify how much additional time will be needed to file the petition keeping in mind that only reasonable requests will be granted.\n\n- If the deadline has already passed, the petitioner must allege the facts constituting 'excusable neglect,' and the mere assertion of excusable neglect unsupported by facts is insufficient. Excusable neglect requires a demonstration of good faith on the part of the party seeking an extension of time and some reasonable basis for noncompliance with the time specified in the rules. In most cases, demonstrating justification requires sending the Board evidence substantiating the reason an extension is needed along with any explanation. Absent a showing along these lines, relief will likely be denied.",

In some cases, state law could require an operator to adopt such a policy.\n\nWhen developing seat-belt-use policies, it must be stressed that Section 38.23(d)(7) prohibits the use of the seat belt and shoulder harness in lieu of securing the wheelchair itself.

                "question": "What does \u201creliably and functionally prevent\u201d mean?",
                "answer": "The statutory mandate directed FRA to issue regulations \u201cspecifying in appropriate technical [detail the essential functionalities of positive train control systems.\u201d Under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005, FRA outlines how a PTC system must be configured to be considered to reliably and functionally prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zones, and movements of trains through switches left in the wrong position.\n\nIn general, FRA regulations require the following actions to reliably and functionally execute the four required performance requirements of PTC:\n\n- Train-to-Train Collisions: To prevent collisions, PTC enforces a positive stop in many cases, and it enforces restricted speed in other cases. There are varying requirements associated with interlocking arrangements where one or more PTC routes intersect with one or more non-PTC routes. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(i), (f).\n\n- Overspeed Derailments: To prevent derailments caused by excessive speed, PTC is required to enforce civil speed limits, slow orders, and reduce excessive speeds over switches and through turnouts. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(ii).\n\n- Incursions into Established Work Zone Limits: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to a train entering an established work zone without first receiving appropriate authority and verification from the dispatcher or roadway worker. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(iii).\n\n- Movement of a Train through a Switch in the Improper Position: PTC is required to enforce restricted speed when a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train\u2019s route in advance of the train\u2019s movement, if there is a wayside or cab signal system. PTC is required to enforce a positive stop before any main line switch and any switch on certain sidings, when the switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train\u2019s route in advance of the train\u2019s movement, but only if the movement over the switch is made without the benefit of the indication of a wayside or cab signal system, or in a condition with unacceptable risk. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(iv), (e).\n\nAs each type of PTC system is designed differently, it may perform or execute the mandated functions in different manners, which FRA reviews and approves in the associated PTC Safety Plans to help ensure compliance. In addition, there are four certification classifications under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1015(e)\u2014i.e., a non-vital overlay system, a vital overlay system, a stand-alone system, and a mixed system. For example, a non-vital overlay PTC system is one that reliably executes the above functions and also is shown to obtain at least an 80% reduction of the risk associated with PTC-preventable accidents.",

                "question": "Does PTC prevent all of the four accident types where PTC is installed?",
                "answer": "PTC systems are designed (and implemented) to reliably and functionally prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zones, and movements of trains through switches left in the wrong position. However, there are some events where PTC, as designed, is not able to prevent an accident:\n\n- Train-to-train collisions at or below restricted speed: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to a train moving through a red signal. But there are operating rules that in some cases, allow a train to pass a red signal, with approval, at restricted speed. PTC will enforce the upper limit of restricted speed, which is 20 miles per hour (mph) or 15 mph, per the railroad\u2019s operating rules. There have been some instances where a rear-end collision has occurred when a train is operating at or below restricted speed, when there was limited visibility, and the train operator did not operate the train ready to stop within one-half the range of vision.\n\n- Overspeed derailments at or below restricted speed: PTC is required to enforce civil speed limits, slow orders, and excessive speeds over switches and through turnouts. As noted above, PTC enforces the upper limit of restricted speed. However, PTC will not necessarily prevent an overspeed movement through a turnout within a restricted speed area if the maximum speed of the turnout is below the maximum restricted speed threshold.\n\n- Incursion into an established work zone: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to entering an established work zone. There have been several near-misses between a train and maintenance of way (MOW) workers when the MOW workers inadvertently located themselves outside the established work zone or, alternatively, did not properly establish a work zone.\n\n- Movement through a switch in the wrong position: PTC is required to enforce restricted speed when a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train\u2019s route in advance of the train\u2019s movement, if there is a wayside or cab signal system. As noted above, PTC enforces the upper limit of restricted speed. There have been some instances where a train has derailed due to the movement through a misaligned switch, noting that depending on visibility and terrain, the train operator must operate the train ready to stop within one-half the range of vision.\n\nFRA reminds the industry that Restricted speed means a speed that will permit a train or other equipment to stop within one-half the range of vision of the person operating the train or other equipment, but not exceeding 20 mph, unless further restricted by the operating rules of the railroad. 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 236.812, 236.1003.",

However, FRA\u2019s PTC regulations and the statutory mandate recognize that PTC technology may sometimes experience failures and be disabled.\n\nDisabling a PTC system without permission or circumventing a PTC enforcement is subject to civil penalty or disqualification for the responsible locomotive engineer or conductor. When PTC is disabled, the PTC system is unable to initiate the brakes to prevent a train-to-train collision, over-speed derailment, incursion into an established work zone, or the movement of a train through a switch left in the wrong position.\n\nIn 2023 and beyond, the only time a railroad may lawfully operate on PTC-mandated territory without a functioning PTC system is if the PTC system has failed en route, including malfunctions and other cut outs. In the instance of a PTC failure en route, the train may operate, with speed limitations, no farther than the next forward designed location for the repair or exchange of onboard PTC apparatuses.

Such data supported railroads\u2019 PTCSPs and FRA\u2019s certification of each host railroad\u2019s PTC system.\n\nFRA continues to oversee the performance and reliability of PTC technology by reviewing, for example, failure-related notifications that railroads, vendors, and suppliers submit under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1023, Errors and malfunctions. Of particular note is the requirement to notify FRA, within 15 days of discovery of a failure, malfunction or defective condition that decreased or eliminated the safety functionality. This notification must, in general, provide specific details regarding the failure, malfunction or defective condition, the status of measures to rectify, and any countermeasures to mitigate the condition. FRA tracks these reports, performs inspections to validate rectification of the conditions and performs audits of railroads\u2019 compliance with its processes and procedures to monitor, report and rectify PTC failures, malfunctions, and defective conditions.\n\nNotably, railroads must also submit Quarterly Reports of PTC System Performance (Form FRA F 6180.152, OMB Control No. 2130-0553)\u2014pursuant to FRA\u2019s PTC regulations and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20157(m).

Before a railroad can make certain changes to an FRA-certified PTC system or the associated FRA-approved PTCSP, a host railroad must submit, and obtain FRA\u2019s approval of, a request for amendment (RFA) to its PTCSP under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021.\n\nFRA\u2019s regulations at 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(h) identify the types of proposed changes that trigger the filing of an RFA to a railroad\u2019s PTC system and PTCSP. Specifically, a railroad is required to submit this type of RFA, for FRA\u2019s review and approval, if the railroad seeks to:\n\n- Modify a safety-critical element of its PTC system; or\n- Modify its PTC system in a way that would affect the safety-critical functionality of any other PTC system with which it interoperates.\n\nFRA\u2019s regulations provide, under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(e), that FRA will publish a notice in the Federal Register and invite public comment on these RFAs. As such, the public has an opportunity to review a railroad\u2019s incoming RFA and submit comments to FRA during the timeframe specified in the Federal Register notice.

                "answer": "As noted above, the statutory mandate requires FRA to certify that each host railroad\u2019s PTC system complies with FRA\u2019s PTC regulations before the technology may be operated in revenue service. In its own PTCSP, each host railroad must provide a complete description of the 'as built' PTC system with its associated safety case, as each host railroad\u2019s operating environment, design choices, and ongoing operation and maintenance procedures may vary.\n\nFollowing notice-and-comment, FRA modified its PTC regulations in July 2021, among other reasons, to permit host railroads utilizing the same type of PTC system, with the same certification classification, to submit joint RFAs to their PTCSPs and PTC Development Plans. Appreciating that changes to safety-critical elements, including software or system architecture, of a certain PTC system will likely impact multiple, if not most, railroads operating that same type of PTC system, 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(l) and (m) outline specific instructions for such host railroads to submit joint RFAs. FRA recognizes that modifying and simplifying the process for host railroads to submit RFAs to PTCSPs for FRA-certified PTC systems is necessary to facilitate required maintenance and upgrades to PTC technology and encourage railroads to enhance their PTC systems to continue to improve rail safety.",

                "answer": "The statute definition of a crossing is defined in 49 CFR Part 234.5(a), in 23 CFR Part 460.2, and in RSIA 2008, Section 204. It is also defined in Section 1.0 of the 'Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory Instructions and Procedures Manual,' dated December 1996, and can be found on the Inventory Program Website at http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/content/801.\n\nFor purposes of the Inventory, 'A highway-rail crossing is the location of an intersection of railroad tracks and a roadway, including associated sidewalks and pathways, and can be either public, private or pedestrian, and either at-grade or grade-separated. A crossing is further defined as including those tracks that lie within a pair of warning devices.' Thus, an intersection of a roadway with 3 tracks (2 mainline and 1 spur) where the mainline tracks have flashing lights and the spur has crossbucks, would actually be two crossings with two separate crossing inventory numbers.\n\nFor a public crossing, the roadway must be part of the general system of public roads, and under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public highway authority, and open to the general traveling public. For a public at-grade crossing, usually both roadway approaches are maintained by a public highway authority, or the public authority accepts responsibility for roadway maintenance through the crossing. All other intersections of railroad tracks with roadways are considered private crossings.",

                "answer": "Yes. Section 1304(e) amends 23 U.S.C. 139(e) by adding: (1) an application review requirement, which requires the Federal lead agency to determine whether to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process (including project readiness), 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(3), and (2) a lead agency designation request process, 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4).\n\n**Review of Project Initiation Application**\nSection 1304(e)(2) adds a new step in the project initiation process. The Federal lead agency or the Secretary (when a Federal lead agency has not been identified) must provide a written response to the project sponsor no later than 45 days after the date on which it receives a project initiation notice (see 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(3)). The written response must either: (1) describe the determination to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process or to decline the application with an explanation for that decision; or (2) request additional information necessary to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process. The Agencies recommend contacting the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) to discuss the proposed project\u2019s details and the Federal lead agency\u2019s preferences before formally submitting the project notification.\n\nWhen submitting a project initiation notice, a project sponsor must continue to provide the project\u2019s type of work, termini, length, general location, and anticipated Federal approvals. However, section 1304(e)(1) clarifies that the project sponsor may provide any additional information it considers important when it proposes to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process for the proposed project. 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(1).\n\n**Request to Designate a Lead Agency**\nSection 1304(e)(2) also establishes a new 'lead agency designation' process (see 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4)). Under this process, a project sponsor may submit a request to the Secretary to designate the operating administration or secretarial office within U.S. DOT with the expertise on the proposed project to serve as the Federal lead agency. The Secretary must respond to the request no later than 45 days after the date of receipt of the request. The response must:\n\n- Approve or deny the request. If the Secretary denies the request, the response must include an explanation for the denial; or\n- Require the project sponsor to submit additional information. If the project sponsor submits additional information, then the Secretary must respond to the submission no later than 45 days after the date of the receipt of the new information.\n\nAlthough project sponsors have the option to request a lead agency designation from the Secretary under 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4), the Agencies recommend that project sponsors first contact the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) (i.e., FHWA, FRA, or FTA) to discuss the project. Where a lead agency is not readily identified, the Agencies will informally consult with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy (OST). For most projects, informal discussions with the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) will result in the identification of the Federal lead agency without using the formal designation process. Should a project sponsor request lead agency designation by the Secretary, OST will consult with the Agencies in making the designation.",

The lead agency must use this approach to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law, unless it must modify the alternatives for either of the following reasons:\n\n- To address significant new information or circumstances, and the lead agency and participating agencies agree that the alternatives must be modified to address new information or circumstances; or\n\n- For the lead agency or a participating agency to fulfill the responsibilities of the agency under NEPA in a timely manner.\n\nApplying a range of alternatives to satisfy multiple Federal environmental reviews and permitting processes will require early and ongoing discussions with the affected Federal agencies.

The new paragraph requires that the lead agency reduce duplication, to the maximum extent practicable, between the evaluation of alternatives under NEPA and the evaluation of alternatives under other processes (i.e., the metropolitan transportation planning process or the State environmental review process). The provision allows lead agencies to eliminate from detailed consideration an alternative proposed in an EIS if the lead agency determines the following conditions are met:\n\n- The alternative was considered in a metropolitan planning process or a State environmental review process by a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) or a State or local transportation agency, as applicable;\n\n- The lead agency provided guidance to the MPO or State or local transportation agency, as applicable, regarding the analysis of alternatives in the metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process, including guidance on the NEPA requirements and any other Federal law necessary for approval of the project;\n\n- The applicable metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process included an opportunity for public review and comment;\n\n- The applicable MPO or State or local transportation agency rejected the alternative after considering public comments;\n\n- The Federal lead agency independently reviewed the alternative evaluation approved by the applicable MPO or State or local transportation agency; and\n\n- The Federal lead agency determined:\n\n  - In consultation with Federal participating or cooperating agencies, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for compliance with NEPA; or\n\n  - With the concurrence of Federal agencies with jurisdiction over a permit or approval required for a project, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for any permit or approval under any other Federal law. The Federal lead agency will provide this determination to the Federal agencies with jurisdiction over a permit or approval required for the project. If the Federal lead agency does not receive a written response within the time period specified in the request for concurrence (typically no more than 30 days, consistent with 23 U.S.C. 139(g)(2)(B)), it will assume concurrence.\n\nThis process does not eliminate the applicability of 23 CFR 450.212 and 450.318 to support the elimination of alternatives.",

Section 139(j)(1) of title 23 U.S.C. is no longer limited to States receiving financial assistance from U.S. DOT under title 23 or chapter 53 of title 49, U.S. Code, but now applies to any public entities receiving those funds.

The agencies will review their Section 4(f) procedures to satisfy this requirement and will announce any changes that result in future guidance.\n\nSection 1301 (23 U.S.C. 138(c)/49 U.S.C. 303(e)) also creates an alternative process for the agencies to comply with Section 4(f) for historic sites when the FHWA, FRA, or FTA determines there is no feasible and prudent alternative to avoid use of a historic site. The alternative process is optional and if used, would require additional concurrence points with other Federal or State entities.

The exemption applies regardless of whether the railroad or rail transit line, or element thereof, is listed on or is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The exemption has two important exceptions:\n\n- First, the exemption does not apply to rail stations or transit stations; and\n- Second, the exemption does not apply to bridges or tunnels located on a rail line that has been abandoned under the process described in 49 U.S.C. 10903 or a transit line that is not in use.\n\nFor purposes of applying this exemption, the following resource types are not considered abandoned or not in use, and thus the exemption applies:\n\n- Railroad and transit lines over which service has been discontinued under the process described in 49 U.S.C. 10903;\n- Railroad and transit lines that have been railbanked (a voluntary agreement between a railroad company and a trail agency to use an out-of-service rail corridor as a trail until a railroad might need the corridor again for rail service as described in 16 U.S.C. 1247(d)); and\n- Railroad and transit lines that have been otherwise reserved for the future transportation of goods or passengers.",

Each railroad would then adopt and comply with the revised model program. Under this scenario, as long as the railroad or contractor appropriately adopted the revised model program, FRA would not consider enforcement action against the railroad or contractor. However, if the model program developer was unresponsive, FRA would need to address that issue with each railroad that adopted the model program.

Any time the training program is modified or otherwise updated, FRA understands that only new employees who have not yet been trained, or employees due for refresher training, would receive training in a given year.

                "question": "What does the rule mean by 'existing freight operations?'",
                "answer": "- 'Existing freight operations' on a track means that the track is used at the present time by regular freight rail traffic (i.e., revenue freight trains carrying goods or returning from delivering goods on behalf of shippers).\n\n- Use of one or more tracks passing through a station and adjacent to a platform for other purposes (including but not limited to use of maintenance equipment by a freight railroad, the rare or token passage of freight trains, storage of ballast cars, movement of private passenger cars, or use of tracks to park freight trains overnight) does not constitute 'existing freight operations' because these activities do not meet any plausible definition of 'freight rail traffic.'\n\n- In addition, where stations serve lines shared by passenger and freight traffic, and a freight train can bypass the track adjacent to the new or altered passenger platform via a gauntlet or other available track such that the freight train does not need to use the track adjacent to the platform, level-entry boarding is required. This means that even if freight trains could access a track adjacent to a passenger platform via a diverging track or other access point but does not have to do so because other tracks exist for freight passage through the station, level entry boarding is required. This also means that track adjacent to a passenger platform track that would be accessed via a diverging move off the main freight line would never be construed to carry freight rail traffic, and therefore, level-entry boarding is always required at such a platform.\n\n- If more than one platform exists in the station and the station has multiple tracks available to freight trains, only a platform adjacent to a track actually used for freight rail traffic would not need to provide level-entry boarding. Other platforms at the station must provide level-entry boarding.\n\n- The possibility that a freight railroad could use a track for freight rail traffic at some time in the future does not mean that there are 'existing' freight operations.\n\n- Where freight trains have not used a track passing through a station for a significant length of time (e.g., as noted in the Preamble to the rule, 10 years), the Department treats the situation as not constituting 'existing' freight operations. However, entities should be aware that the example provided of '10 years' is as an illustration only. There may be occasions when a railroad not using tracks for freight train service over a period of less than 10 years would still constitute a significant length of time, depending on all the circumstances\u2014e.g., when a freight customer no longer exists for a particular line. In such a case, the Department would regard the track as not being used for 'existing' freight traffic on that track.",

                "question": "If a platform is owned by a private entity other than the passenger railroad, what happens if the private entity objects to the creation of a level boarding platform?",
                "answer": "- Under section 37.42(b), if there is a new or altered station serving a passenger rail system, in which no track passing through the station and adjacent to the platform is shared with existing freight rail operations, the passenger railroad must comply with the performance standard by providing level-entry boarding.\n\n- Where a station platform is owned by a private entity (e.g., a freight railroad), other than the passenger railroad operator providing service at the station, section 37.49(e) provides that the passenger railroad operator is the \u201cresponsible person\u201d for complying with the requirements of Subpart C of Part 37 (the subpart concerning transportation facilities).\n\n- Under section 37.57, an owner or the person in control of an intercity or commuter rail station is required to provide reasonable cooperation to the responsible person for that station with respect to the efforts of the responsible person to comply with the requirements of Subpart C of Part 37.\n\n- Consequently, the private entity that owns the station platform is required by section 37.57 to cooperate with the efforts of the passenger railroad to comply with the requirements of section 37.42(b). Because of this requirement, the private entity cannot refuse to permit the passenger railroad to construct or alter a platform that will provide level boarding.",

This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for non-level boarding platforms.\n\nWhere non-level boarding platforms exist, on-board lifts may be used to move passengers who cannot climb stairs from the platform level up to the passenger car. 49 CFR 37.165(g). The actual design of the platform lift mechanism varies from one builder to another, but it is not uncommon for the passenger car edge of the lift platform in the fully deployed position to be a number of inches away from the actual side of the passenger car body. An allowance of 1 foot from the side of the passenger car to the edge of the lift platform has been made to accommodate various lifting mechanism designs. The lifting platform cannot be more than 3 inches above the platform in the down position with a connecting ramp slope not exceeding 1:8 (49 CFR 38.95(b)(8), 38.125(b)(8)), which could result in a ramp to the lift platform being a maximum of 24 inches long. Per section 304.3 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a person using a wheelchair to turn and enter the on-board lift.\n\nFor a new or altered conventional non-level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width thus should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above \u2013 12 feet.\n\nFor a non-level boarding end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 14 feet for an end loading island platform.\n\nFor a non-level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalator, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access feature (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42 for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet. The non-level boarding platform may be tapered to 14 feet at the end(s) of the platform.",

                "answer": "Under 49 CFR Part 37, all new or altered railroad station platforms, including non-level boarding platforms, used for intercity rail passenger service or commuter rail passenger service must be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including persons who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or walkers. 49 CFR 37.9, 37.41-37.43, 37.55. We have received questions from entities constructing or altering platforms as to the minimum platform width needed to accommodate passengers using such mobility aid devices. This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for level boarding platforms.\n\nA level boarding intercity or commuter railroad passenger station platform can have a gap between the passenger car door threshold and the edge of the platform that is at the maximum horizontal dimension of 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and a maximum vertical dimension of 5.5 inches. 49 CFR 37.42(f). At level boarding platforms, where the gap exceeds plus or minus 5/8 inch vertical or 3 inches horizontal (49 CFR 37.42(f)), a bridge plate is typically used to allow a passenger using a wheelchair or other mobility device to move from the platform to the passenger car. While they can vary in dimensions, a typical bridge plate is approximately 3 feet long. Per ADAAG 304.3, a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a passenger using a wheelchair to make a turn to enter the bridge plate and onto the passenger car.\n\nFor a conventional level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or a wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above \u2013 i.e., 8 feet.\n\nFor an end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 10 feet for an end loading level boarding island platform.\n\nFor a level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalators, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access facility (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42(e)(1) for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet. The level boarding island with vertical pedestrian access platform may be tapered to 10 feet at the end(s) of the platform, as long as the gap between the car and the platform through the curved portion complies with 49 CFR 37.42(f), which defines the maximum allowable gap at level boarding platforms to be 10 inches on tangent and 13 inches on curved tracks.\n\nCircumstances may arise where a 15-inch high passenger platform designed to provide level boarding to typical bi-level passenger cars is also used by conventional single level passenger cars, which typically have 51-inch car door heights. In this case, the 3 feet allocated for a bridge plate should be replaced by either the 5 feet used by an on-board lift or 4 feet used by a platform mounted lift. Thus, a 15-inch high platform used by single level passenger cars should be treated as if it were a non-level boarding platform.",

                "answer": "\u201cExisting freight operations\u201d on a track means that the track is used at the present time by regular freight rail traffic (i.e., revenue freight trains carrying goods or returning from delivering goods on behalf of shippers).\n\nUse of one or more tracks passing through a station and adjacent to a platform for other purposes (including but not limited to use of maintenance equipment by a freight railroad, the rare or token passage of freight trains, storage of ballast cars, movement of private passenger cars, or use of tracks to park freight trains overnight) does not constitute \u201cexisting freight operations\u201d because these activities do not meet any plausible definition of \u201cfreight rail traffic.\u201d\n\nIn addition, where stations serve lines shared by passenger and freight traffic, and a freight train can bypass the track adjacent to the new or altered passenger platform via a gauntlet or other available track such that the freight train does not need to use the track adjacent to the platform, level-entry boarding is required. This means that even if freight trains could access a track adjacent to a passenger platform via a diverging track or other access point but does not have to do so because other tracks exist for freight passage through the station, level-entry boarding is required. This also means that track adjacent to a passenger platform track that would be accessed via a diverging move off the main freight line would never be construed to carry freight rail traffic, and therefore, level-entry boarding is always required at such a platform.\n\nIf more than one platform exists in the station and the station has multiple tracks available to freight trains, only a platform adjacent to a track actually used for freight rail traffic would not need to provide level-entry boarding. Other platforms at the station must provide level-entry boarding.\n\nThe possibility that a freight railroad could use a track for freight rail traffic at some time in the future does not mean that there are \u201cexisting\u201d freight operations.\n\nWhere freight trains have not used a track passing through a station for a significant length of time (e.g., as noted in the Preamble to the rule, 10 years), the Department treats the situation as not constituting \u201cexisting\u201d freight operations. However, entities should be aware that the example provided of \u201c10 years\u201d is as an illustration only. There may be occasions when a railroad not using tracks for freight train service over a period of less than 10 years would still constitute a significant length of time, depending on all the circumstances\u2014e.g., when a freight customer no longer exists for a particular line. In such a case, the Department would regard the track as not being used for \u201cexisting\u201d freight traffic on that track.",

Plans for meeting the performance standard at new or altered stations where track adjacent to the platform is shared with freight traffic must be submitted on a station-by-station basis.\n\nThat is, there must be a separate plan for each such station. It is not sufficient to have a generic plan for a line or a system.\n\nWhile there may well be common features of a railroad\u2019s plans for various stations in its system, there are also likely to be differences among stations. The design and layout of stations, the number of trains that stop at the station, the passenger volume at the station, whether there are other railroads that use the station, and other factors are likely to vary from station to station. Station plans need to take these variables into account at each station.\n\nIn reviewing station plans, FRA and FTA intend to give particular scrutiny to larger, more complex, stations and those with higher passenger volumes to ensure that the railroad\u2019s plan will fully meet the performance standard in practice.",

                "answer": "Public entities, such as Amtrak and commuter operators, must construct a new facility for use in designated public transportation so that it is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.41(a)). Likewise, when a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of such a facility, the entity must make the alterations in such a way that the altered part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.43(a)(1)). This latter requirement also specifically applies to alterations of an intercity or commuter rail station by its owner, the \u201cresponsible person\u201d for the station, or a person in control of the station (see sec. 37.43(a)(3)).\n\nA transportation facility is considered to be accessible if it meets the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG; see 36 CFR Part 1191, including Appendices B and D), as modified by Appendix A to Part 37.\n\nAppendix A to Part 37 (see section 801.5.3) provides that low-level platforms in rail stations must be at least 8 inches above top of rail (ATR). We note that there may be rare situations in which meeting this requirement is impracticable (e.g., there is a highway grade crossing intersecting the platform). FRA and/or FTA will address such unusual situations on a case-by-case basis, as needed.\n\nBecause of these requirements, when an intercity or commuter railroad constructs or alters a platform, it must ensure the platform is at least 8 inches ATR. Note that alterations to parts of a station other than the platform do not trigger this requirement.\n\nIn addition to this basic facility accessibility requirement, section 37.42 requires a railroad that alters a station platform and does not provide level boarding to ensure that passengers with disabilities can board any accessible car of a train available to other passengers at that station, using means including car-borne lifts, station-based lifts, or mini-high platforms. Meeting this requirement does not exempt the railroad from the separate requirement to ensure that an altered or newly constructed platform is at least 8 inches ATR.\n\nWhile a platform 8 inches above ATR generally does not provide level boarding, a platform at this height does facilitate boarding by ambulatory passengers, including passengers (e.g., elderly persons) who might have difficulty ascending a vertical distance greater than the normal vertical gap between an 8-inch ATR platform and the first step of a railroad car.",

                "answer": "The performance standard of section 37.42(a) requires that passengers with disabilities \u201cmust have access to all accessible cars available to passengers without disabilities in each train using the station.\n\nThe standard applies only to \u201caccessible\u201d cars meeting the requirements of 49 CFR Part 38. Some railroads continue to operate a number of inaccessible cars (e.g., 1950s-era double-decker commuter cars) that people with mobility impairments cannot enter and use. The requirement does not apply to cars of this kind.\n\nMoreover, the standard applies only to \u201ccars available to passengers without disabilities\u201d at a given station. There can be a number of situations in which not all cars in a train are made available to anyone at a station.\n\nFor example, at a station with a relatively short platform, only cars 1-4 of an 8-car train may be available to any passenger. In some commuter rail systems, only two cars are open to be boarded by any passenger at a station.\n\nIn situations like these, only those cars that are made available to other passengers at the station have to be made available to passengers with disabilities. The railroad operator generally would not be required to make cars available to passengers with disabilities that are not made available to other passengers.\n\nHowever, if all wheelchair locations are occupied by other wheelchair users in cars where the doors normally open at a station, the Department expects the railroad operator to double-stop or move a lift, where necessary, in order to provide transportation to a wheelchair user in an unoccupied wheelchair location. (Of course, railroad operators are always responsible for moving passengers\u2019 luggage and other items out of wheelchair locations to permit their use by a wheelchair user.) Likewise, if the only way a passenger with a disability can access a food service car is through an adjacent car, then the railroad should provide access to the adjacent car.",

                "answer": "Given that this is an emergency situation requiring railroads to quickly and effectively instruct employees, FRA\u2019s expectation is that the minimum initial instruction and distribution of the EO would include one face-to-face on-the-job briefing covering the requirements of this EO and the operating rules to which they relate. This job briefing must include examples or real-time applications of the EO, as well as a reasonable opportunity for employees to ask questions. Regarding periodic instruction, railroads will include this instruction as part of their program of instruction pursuant to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 217.11.",
