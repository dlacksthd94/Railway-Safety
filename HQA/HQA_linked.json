                "question": "As a remote control operator (RCO), am I required to be certified the same as a locomotive engineer?",
                "answer": "Yes. The engineer certification regulation requires that anyone who moves a locomotive must be certified. There are two exceptions: 1) when operating a locomotive(s) within the confines of a locomotive repair or servicing area (no cars attached); and 2) when moving a locomotive(s) for distances of less than 100 feet for inspection and maintenance purposes.",

A plant or installation that operates a locomotive to switch or move cars for other entities, even if solely within the confines of the plant or installation, rather than for its own purposes or industrial processes, will not be considered a plant railroad because the performance of such activity makes the operation part of the general railroad system of transportation.\n\nQualified   means a person who has successfully completed all instruction, training and examination programs required by the employer and the applicable parts of this chapter, and that the person therefore may reasonably be expected to be proficient on all safety-related tasks the person is assigned to perform.\n\nRailroad   means any form of nonhighway ground transportation that runs on rails or electromagnetic guideways and any entity providing such transportation, including\n\n(1) Commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a metropolitan or suburban area and commuter railroad service that was operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation on January 1, 1979; and\n\n(2) High speed ground transportation systems that connect metropolitan areas, without regard to whether those systems use new technologies not associated with traditional railroads; but does not include rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation.\n\nRailroad Officer   means any supervisory employee of a railroad.\n\nRailroad rolling stock   is on-track equipment that is either a \u201crailroad freight car\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 215.5 of this chapter) or a \u201cpassenger car\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 238.5 of this chapter).\n\nRoadway maintenance equipment   is on-track equipment powered by any means of energy other than hand power which is used in conjunction with maintenance, repair, construction or inspection of track, bridges, roadway, signal, communications, or electric traction systems.\n\nSegment   means any portion of a railroad assigned to the supervision of one superintendent or equivalent transportation officer.\n\nServe or service,   in the context of serving documents, has the meaning given in Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as amended. Similarly, the computation of time provisions in Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as amended are also applicable in this part. See also the definition of \u201cfiling\u201d in this section.\n\nSpecialized roadway maintenance equipment   is roadway maintenance equipment that does not have the capability to move railroad rolling stock. Any alteration of such equipment that enables it to move railroad rolling stock will require that the equipment be treated as a dual purpose vehicle.\n\nSubstance abuse disorder   refers to a psychological or physical dependence on alcohol or a drug, or another identifiable and treatable mental or physical disorder involving the abuse of alcohol or drugs as a primary manifestation. A substance abuse disorder is \u201cactive\u201d within the meaning of this part if the person is currently using alcohol or other drugs, except under medical supervision consistent with the restrictions described in \u00a7 219.103 of this chapter or has failed to complete primary treatment successfully or participate in aftercare successfully as directed by a DAC or SAP.\n\nSubstance Abuse Professional (SAP)   means a person who meets the qualifications of a Substance Abuse Professional, as provided in part 40 of this title.\n\nTerritorial qualifications   means possessing the necessary knowledge concerning a railroad's operating rules and timetable special instructions, including familiarity with applicable main track and other than main track physical characteristics of the territory over which the locomotive or train movement will occur.\n\nTourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operations that are not part of the general railroad system of transportation   means a tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operation conducted only on track used exclusively for that purpose (i.e., there is no freight, intercity passenger, or commuter passenger railroad operation on the track).\n\nType I Simulator   means a replica of the control compartment of a locomotive with all associated control equipment that:\n\n(1) Functions in response to a person's manipulation and causes the gauges associated with such controls to appropriately respond to the consequences of that manipulation;\n\n(2) Pictorially, audibly and graphically illustrates the route to be taken;\n\n(3) Graphically, audibly, and physically illustrates the consequences of control manipulations in terms of their effect on train speed, braking capacity, and in-train force levels throughout the train; and\n\n(4) Is computer enhanced so that it can be programmed for specific train consists and the known physical characteristics of the line illustrated.\n\nType II Simulator   means a replica of the control equipment for a locomotive that:\n\n(1) Functions in response to a person's manipulation and causes the gauges associated with such controls to appropriately respond to the consequences of that manipulation;\n\n(2) Pictorially, audibly, and graphically illustrates the route to be taken;\n\n(3) Graphically and audibly illustrates the consequences of control manipulations in terms of their effect on train speed braking capacity, and in-train force levels throughout the train; and\n\n(4) Is computer enhanced so that it can be programmed for specific train consists and the known physical characteristics of the line illustrated.\n\nType III Simulator   means a replica of the control equipment for a locomotive that:\n\n(1) Functions in response to a person's manipulation and causes the gauges associated with such controls to appropriately respond to the consequences of that manipulation;\n\n(2) Graphically illustrates the route to be taken;\n\n(3) Graphically illustrates the consequences of control manipulations in terms of their effect on train speed braking capacity, and in-train force levels throughout the train; and\n\n(4) Is computer enhanced so that it can be programmed for specific train consists and the known physical characteristics of the line illustrated.\n\n[56 FR 28254, June 19, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 19002, Apr. 9, 1993; 60 FR 53136, Oct. 12, 1995; 64 FR 60989, Nov. 8, 1999; 65 FR 58483, Sept. 29, 2000; 67 FR 24, Jan. 2, 2002; 74 FR 68182, Dec. 23, 2009; 85 FR 81307, Dec. 15, 2020]\n\n"

                "answer": "- The performance standard of section 37.42(a) requires that passengers with disabilities \u201cmust have access to all accessible cars available to passengers without disabilities in each train using the station.\n\n- The standard applies only to \u201caccessible\u201d cars meeting the requirements of 49 CFR Part 38. Some railroads continue to operate a number of inaccessible cars (e.g., 1950s-era double-decker commuter cars) that people with mobility impairments cannot enter and use. The requirement does not apply to cars of this kind.\n\n- Moreover, the standard applies only to \u201ccars available to passengers without disabilities\u201d at a given station. There can be a number of situations in which not all cars in a train are made available to anyone at a station.\n\n- For example, at a station with a relatively short platform, only cars 1-4 of an 8-car train may be available to any passenger. In some commuter rail systems, only two cars are open to be boarded by any passenger at a station.\n\n- In situations like these, only those cars that are made available to other passengers at the station have to be made available to passengers with disabilities. The railroad operator generally would not be required to make cars available to passengers with disabilities that are not made available to other passengers.\n\n- However, if all wheelchair locations are occupied by other wheelchair users in cars where the doors normally open at a station, the Department expects the railroad operator to double-stop or move a lift, where necessary, in order to provide transportation to a wheelchair user in an unoccupied wheelchair location. (Of course, railroad operators are always responsible for moving passengers\u2019 luggage and other items out of wheelchair locations to permit their use by a wheelchair user.) Likewise, if the only way a passenger with a disability can access a food service car is through an adjacent car, then the railroad should provide access to the adjacent car.",

                "answer": "- Public entities, such as Amtrak and commuter operators, must construct a new facility for use in designated public transportation so that it is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.41(a)). Likewise, when a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of such a facility, the entity must make the alterations in such a way that the altered part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities (see sec. 37.43(a)(1)). This latter requirement also specifically applies to alterations of an intercity or commuter rail station by its owner, the 'responsible person' for the station, or a person in control of the station (see sec. 37.43(a)(3)).\n\n- A transportation facility is considered to be accessible if it meets the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG; see 36 CFR Part 1191, including Appendices B and D), as modified by Appendix A to Part 37.\n\n- Appendix A to Part 37 (see section 801.5.3) provides that low-level platforms in rail stations must be at least 8 inches above top of rail (ATR). We note that there may be rare situations in which meeting this requirement is impracticable (e.g., there is a highway grade crossing intersecting the platform). FRA and/or FTA will address such unusual situations on a case-by-case basis, as needed.\n\n- Because of these requirements, when an intercity or commuter railroad constructs or alters a platform, it must ensure the platform is at least 8 inches ATR. Note that alterations to parts of a station other than the platform do not trigger this requirement.\n\n- In addition to this basic facility accessibility requirement, section 37.42 requires a railroad that alters a station platform and does not provide level boarding to ensure that passengers with disabilities can board any accessible car of a train available to other passengers at that station, using means including car-borne lifts, station-based lifts, or mini-high platforms. Meeting this requirement does not exempt the railroad from the separate requirement to ensure that an altered or newly constructed platform is at least 8 inches ATR.\n\n- While a platform 8 inches above ATR generally does not provide level boarding, a platform at this height does facilitate boarding by ambulatory passengers, including passengers (e.g., elderly persons) who might have difficulty ascending a vertical distance greater than the normal vertical gap between an 8-inch ATR platform and the first step of a railroad car.",

This requirement also applies to the construction of a new station for use in intercity or commuter rail transportation. For purposes of this section, a facility or station is \u201cnew\u201d if its construction begins (i.e., issuance of notice to proceed) after January 25, 1992, or, in the case of intercity or commuter rail stations, after October 7, 1991.\n\n(b) (1) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\n\n(2) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.\n\n(3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.\n\n[56 FR 45621, Sept. 6, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 63266, Oct. 30, 2006]\n\n\u00a7 37.9(a)\nFor purposes of this part, a transportation facility shall be considered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if it meets the requirements of this part and the requirements set forth in Appendices B and D to 36 CFR part 1191, which apply to buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, as modified by Appendix A to this part.\n\n"

                "question": "What is the difference among the terms denial of certification, denial of recertification and revocation?",
                "answer": "- Denial of certification refers to the situation in which a person who is not a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not grant the person initial certification. A railroad might choose to deny a person certification if the railroad decides that the person, despite having finished a railroad-approved training program, cannot pass all of the minimum requirements. For example, the person may not have passed the skills performance or knowledge tests, or the person did not meet the minimum hearing and vision requirements. The rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying certification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Denial of recertification refers to the situation in which a person who is a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not be renewing the person\u2019s certificate when it is due to expire. The regulations require that railroads renew a certificate at least every three (3) years. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.217(c) and 242.201(c). Like a denial of certification, a denial of recertification may be based on a person\u2019s inability to meet any of the minimum requirements and the rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying recertification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Certificate revocation refers to the situation in which the railroad determines that a certified locomotive engineer or conductor either (1) has violated a cardinal operating rule or practice [as specified in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.117(e) and 242.403(e)] or (2) is ineligible to hold a certificate due to a substance abuse disorder or violations of FRA\u2019s alcohol and drug regulations. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.119 and 242.115. Prior to revoking a person\u2019s certificate, the regulations require a railroad to provide the certified engineer or conductor with 'the opportunity for a hearing;' however, that opportunity can be waived. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.307 and 242.407.",

Excusable neglect requires a demonstration of good faith on the part of the party seeking an extension of time and some reasonable basis for noncompliance with the time specified in the rules.

                "question": "What is the difference among the terms denial of certification, denial of recertification and revocation?",
                "answer": "- Denial of certification refers to the situation in which a person who is not a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not grant the person initial certification. A railroad might choose to deny a person certification if the railroad decides that the person, despite having finished a railroad-approved training program, cannot pass all of the minimum requirements. For example, the person may not have passed the skills performance or knowledge tests, or the person did not meet the minimum hearing and vision requirements. The rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying certification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Denial of recertification refers to the situation in which a person who is a certified locomotive engineer or conductor receives notification from a railroad that it will not be renewing the person\u2019s certificate when it is due to expire. The regulations require that railroads renew a certificate at least every three (3) years. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.217(c) and 242.201(c). Like a denial of certification, a denial of recertification may be based on a person\u2019s inability to meet any of the minimum requirements and the rule provides a person with a reasonable opportunity to explore and respond to the negative information that might serve as the railroad\u2019s basis for denying recertification. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.219 and 242.401.\n\n- Certificate revocation refers to the situation in which the railroad determines that a certified locomotive engineer or conductor either (1) has violated a cardinal operating rule or practice [as specified in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.117(e) and 242.403(e)] or (2) is ineligible to hold a certificate due to a substance abuse disorder or violations of FRA\u2019s alcohol and drug regulations. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.119 and 242.115. Prior to revoking a person\u2019s certificate, the regulations require a railroad to provide the certified engineer or conductor with \u201cthe opportunity for a hearing;\u201d however, that opportunity can be waived.

That waiver shall:\n\n(1) Be made in writing;\n\n(2) Reflect the fact that the person has knowledge and understanding of these rights and voluntarily surrenders them; and\n\n(3) Be signed by the person making the waiver.\n\n(g) A railroad that has relied on the certification by another railroad under the provisions of \u00a7 242.127 or \u00a7 242.301, shall revoke its certification if, during the period that certification is valid, the railroad acquires information which convinces it that another railroad has revoked its certification in accordance with the provisions of this section. The requirement to provide a hearing under this section is satisfied when any single railroad holds a hearing and no additional hearing is required prior to a revocation by more than one railroad arising from the same facts.\n\n(h) The period of certificate suspension prior to the commencement of a hearing required under this section shall be credited towards satisfying any applicable revocation period imposed in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 242.405.\n\n(i) A railroad:\n\n(1) Shall not revoke the person's certification as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section if sufficient evidence exists to establish that an intervening cause prevented or materially impaired the conductor's ability to comply with the railroad operating rule or practice which constitutes a violation under \u00a7 242.403(e)(1) through (e)(11); or\n\n(2) May decide not to revoke the person's certification as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section if sufficient evidence exists to establish that the violation of \u00a7 242.403(e)(1) through (11) was of a minimal nature and had no direct or potential effect on rail safety.\n\n(j) The railroad shall place the relevant information in the records maintained in compliance with \u00a7 242.215 for Class I (including the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) and Class II railroads, and \u00a7 242.203 for Class III railroads if sufficient evidence meeting the criteria provided in paragraph (i) of this section, becomes available either:\n\n(1) Prior to a railroad's action to suspend the certificate as provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or\n\n(2) Prior to the convening of the hearing provided for in this section;\n\n(k) Provided that the railroad makes a good faith determination after a reasonable inquiry that the course of conduct provided for in paragraph (i) of this section is appropriate, the railroad which does not suspend a conductor's certification, as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, is not in violation of paragraph (a) of this section.\n\nSubpart F\u2014Dispute Resolution Procedures\n\n"

Moreover, it is recommended that a petitioner specify how much additional time will be needed to file the petition keeping in mind that only reasonable requests will be granted.\n\n- If the deadline has already passed, the petitioner must allege the facts constituting 'excusable neglect,' and the mere assertion of excusable neglect unsupported by facts is insufficient. Excusable neglect requires a demonstration of good faith on the part of the party seeking an extension of time and some reasonable basis for noncompliance with the time specified in the rules. In most cases, demonstrating justification requires sending the Board evidence substantiating the reason an extension is needed along with any explanation.

Alternatively, transit operators may adopt a policy that allows wheelchairs to ride unsecured. If the rider wishes his or her wheelchair to be secured, however, the operator\u2019s personnel must provide the requested assistance.

For example, on fixed route buses, if none of the other passengers are required to wear shoulder belts then neither can the person in the mobility device be required to do so.\n\nTransit operators may establish a policy that requires the seat belt and shoulder harness to be used by all riders, including those who use wheelchairs as well as those who use vehicle seats, if seat belts and shoulder harnesses are provided at all seating locations. In some cases, state law could require an operator to adopt such a policy.\n\nWhen developing seat-belt-use policies, it must be stressed that Section 38.23(d)(7) prohibits the use of the seat belt and shoulder harness in lieu of securing the wheelchair itself.

                "question": "What does \u201creliably and functionally prevent\u201d mean?",
                "answer": "The statutory mandate directed FRA to issue regulations \u201cspecifying in appropriate technical [detail the essential functionalities of positive train control systems.\u201d Under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005, FRA outlines how a PTC system must be configured to be considered to reliably and functionally prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zones, and movements of trains through switches left in the wrong position.\n\nIn general, FRA regulations require the following actions to reliably and functionally execute the four required performance requirements of PTC:\n\n- Train-to-Train Collisions: To prevent collisions, PTC enforces a positive stop in many cases, and it enforces restricted speed in other cases. There are varying requirements associated with interlocking arrangements where one or more PTC routes intersect with one or more non-PTC routes. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(i), (f).\n\n- Overspeed Derailments: To prevent derailments caused by excessive speed, PTC is required to enforce civil speed limits, slow orders, and reduce excessive speeds over switches and through turnouts. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(ii).\n\n- Incursions into Established Work Zone Limits: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to a train entering an established work zone without first receiving appropriate authority and verification from the dispatcher or roadway worker. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(iii).\n\n- Movement of a Train through a Switch in the Improper Position: PTC is required to enforce restricted speed when a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train\u2019s route in advance of the train\u2019s movement, if there is a wayside or cab signal system. PTC is required to enforce a positive stop before any main line switch and any switch on certain sidings, when the switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train\u2019s route in advance of the train\u2019s movement, but only if the movement over the switch is made without the benefit of the indication of a wayside or cab signal system, or in a condition with unacceptable risk. See 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1005(a)(1)(iv), (e).\n\nAs each type of PTC system is designed differently, it may perform or execute the mandated functions in different manners, which FRA reviews and approves in the associated PTC Safety Plans to help ensure compliance. In addition, there are four certification classifications under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1015(e)\u2014i.e., a non-vital overlay system, a vital overlay system, a stand-alone system, and a mixed system. For example, a non-vital overlay PTC system is one that reliably executes the above functions and also is shown to obtain at least an 80% reduction of the risk associated with PTC-preventable accidents.",
                "context": "\u00a7 236.1005\nRequirements for Positive Train Control systems.\n\n(a) PTC system requirements.  Each PTC system required to be installed under this subpart shall:\n\n(1) Reliably and functionally prevent:\n\n(i) Train-to-train collisions\u2014including collisions between trains operating over rail-to-rail at-grade crossings in accordance with the following risk-based table or alternative arrangements providing an equivalent level of safety as specified in an FRA approved PTCSP:\n\nCrossing type\n\nMax. speed\n\nProtectionrequired\n\n(A) Interlocking\u2014one or more PTC routes intersecting with one or more non-PTC routes\n\n\u226440 miles per hour\n\nInterlocking signal arrangement in accordance with the requirements of subparts A-G of this part and PTC enforced stop on PTC routes.\n\n(B) Interlocking\u2014one or more PTC routes intersecting with one or more non-PTC routes\n\n>40 miles per hour\n\nInterlocking signal arrangement in accordance with the requirements of subparts A-G of this part, PTC enforced stop on all PTC routes, and either the use of other than full PTC technology that provides positive stop enforcement or a split-point derail incorporated into the signal system accompanied by 20 miles per hour maximum allowable speed on the approach of any intersecting non-PTC route.\n\n(C) Interlocking\u2014all PTC routes intersecting\n\nAny speed\n\nInterlocking signal arrangements in accordance with the requirements of subparts A-G of this part, and PTC enforced stop on all routes.\n\n(ii) Overspeed derailments, including derailments related to railroad civil engineering speed restrictions, slow orders, and excessive speeds over switches and through turnouts;\n\n(iii) Incursions into established work zone limits without first receiving appropriate authority and verification from the dispatcher or roadway worker in charge, as applicable and in accordance with part 214 of this chapter; and\n\n(iv) The movement of a train through a main line switch in the improper position as further described in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(2) Include safety-critical integration of all authorities and indications of a wayside or cab signal system, or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety, in a manner by which the PTC system shall provide associated warning and enforcement to the extent, and except as, described and justified in the FRA approved PTCDP or PTCSP, as applicable;\n\n(3) As applicable, perform the additional functions specified in this subpart;\n\n(4) Provide an appropriate warning or enforcement when:\n\n(i) A derail or switch protecting access to the main line required by \u00a7 236.1007, or otherwise provided for in the applicable PTCSP, is not in its derailing or protecting position, respectively;\n\n(ii) A mandatory directive is issued associated with a highway-rail grade crossing warning system malfunction as required by \u00a7\u00a7 234.105, 234.106, or 234.107;\n\n(iii) An after-arrival mandatory directive has been issued and the train or trains to be waited on has not yet passed the location of the receiving train;\n\n(iv) Any movable bridge within the route ahead is not in a position to allow permissive indication for a train movement pursuant to \u00a7 236.312; and\n\n(v) A hazard detector integrated into the PTC system that is required by paragraph (c) of this section, or otherwise provided for in the applicable PTCSP, detects an unsafe condition or transmits an alarm; and\n\n(5) Limit the speed of passenger and freight trains to 59 miles per hour and 49 miles per hour, respectively, in areas without broken rail detection or equivalent safeguards.\n\n(b) PTC system installation \u2014(1) Lines required to be equipped.  Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, each Class I railroad and each railroad providing or hosting intercity or commuter passenger service shall progressively equip its lines as provided in its approved PTCIP such that a PTC system certified under \u00a7 236.1015 is installed and operated by the host railroad on each:\n\n(i) Main line over which is transported any quantity of material poisonous by inhalation (PIH), including anhydrous ammonia, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 171.8, 173.115 and 173.132 of this title;\n\n(ii) Main line used for regularly provided intercity or commuter passenger service, except as provided in \u00a7 236.1019; and\n\n(iii) Additional line of railroad as required by the applicable FRA approved PTCIP, this subpart, or an FRA order requiring installation of a PTC system by that date.\n\n(2) Initial baseline identification of lines.  For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the baseline information necessary to determine whether a Class I railroad's track segment shall be equipped with a PTC system shall be determined and reported as follows:\n\n(i) The traffic density threshold of 5 million gross tons shall be based upon calendar year 2008 gross tonnage, except to the extent that traffic may fall below 5 million gross tons for two consecutive calendar years and a PTCIP or an RFA reflecting this change is filed and approved under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and, if applicable, \u00a7 236.1021.\n\n(ii) The presence or absence of any quantity of PIH hazardous materials shall be determined by whether one or more cars containing such product(s) was transported over the track segment in calendar year 2008 or prior to the filing of the PTCIP, except to the extent that the PTCIP or RFA justifies, under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, removal of the subject track segment from the PTCIP listing of lines to be equipped.\n\n(3) Addition of track segments.  To the extent increases in freight rail traffic occur subsequent to calendar year 2008 that might affect the requirement to install a PTC system on any line not yet equipped, the railroad shall seek to amend its PTCIP by promptly filing an RFA in accordance with \u00a7 236.1021. The following criteria apply:\n\n(i) If rail traffic exceeds 5 million gross tons in any year after 2008, the tonnage shall be calculated for the preceding two calendar years and if the total tonnage for those two calendar years exceeds 10 million gross tons, a PTCIP or its amendment is required.\n\n(ii) If PIH traffic is carried on a track segment as a result of a request for rail service or rerouting warranted under part 172 of this title, and if the line carries in excess of 5 million gross tons of rail traffic as determined under this paragraph, a PTCIP or its amendment is required. This does not apply when temporary rerouting is authorized in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n(iii) Once a railroad is notified by FRA that its RFA filed in accordance with this paragraph has been approved, the railroad shall equip the line with the applicable PTC system by December 31, 2015, or within 24 months, whichever is later.\n\n(4) Exclusion or removal of track segments from PTC baseline \u2014(i) Routing changes.  In a PTCIP or an RFA, a railroad may request review of the requirement to install PTC on a track segment where a PTC system is otherwise required by this section, but has not yet been installed, based upon changes in rail traffic such as reductions in total traffic volume to a level below 5 million gross tons annually, cessation of passenger service or the approval of an MTEA, or the cessation of PIH materials traffic. Any such request shall be accompanied by estimated traffic projections for the next 5 years (e.g., as a result of planned rerouting, coordinations, or location of new business on the line).\n\n(ii) FRA will approve the exclusion requested pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section if the railroad establishes that, as of December 31, 2015:\n\n(A) No passenger service will be present on the involved track segment or the passenger service will be subject to an MTEA approved in accordance with 49 CFR 236.1019; and\n\n(B) No PIH traffic will be present on the involved track segment or the gross tonnage on the involved track segment will decline to below 5 million gross tons annually as computed over a 2-year period.\n\n(iii) Freight lines with de minimis risk not used for regularly provided intercity or commuter rail passenger service. (A) In a PTCIP or an RFA, a railroad may request review of the requirement to install a PTC system on a track segment where a PTC system is otherwise required by this section, but has not yet been installed, based upon the presence of a minimal quantity of PIH materials traffic. Any such request shall be accompanied by estimated traffic projections for the next 5 years (e.g., as a result of planned rerouting, coordination, or location of new business on the line). Where the request involves prior or planned rerouting of PIH materials traffic, the railroad must provide the information and analysis identified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. The submission shall also include a full description of potential safety hazards on the segment of track and fully describe train operations over the line. This paragraph does not apply to line segments used for commuter rail or intercity rail passenger service.\n\n(B) Absent special circumstances related to specific hazards presented by operations on the line segment, FRA will approve a request for relief under this paragraph for a rail line segment that meets all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) That carries less than 15 million gross tons annually;\n\n(2) That does not have a heavy grade as \u201cheavy grade\u201d is defined in \u00a7 232.407 of this chapter for any train operating over the track segment;\n\n(3) Where the railroad adopts and complies with an operating rule requiring the crew of any train approaching working limits established under part 214 of this chapter to notify the roadway worker in charge of the train's approach at least 2 miles in advance of the working limits or, if the train crew does not have advance knowledge of the working limits, as soon as practical;\n\n(4) That carries fewer than 100 cars containing PIH materials per year, excluding those cars containing only a residue, as defined in \u00a7 171.8 of this title, of PIH materials;\n\n(5) That carries 2 or fewer trains per day carrying any quantity of PIH materials;\n\n(6) Where trains carrying any quantity of PIH materials operate at speeds not to exceed 40 miles per hour; and\n\n(7) Where any train transporting a car containing any quantity of PIH materials is operated with a vacant block ahead of and behind the train.\n\n(C) FRA may, in its discretion, approve other track segments not used for regularly provided intercity or commuter passenger service that have posed an equivalent or lesser level of risk of a PTC-preventable accident or PIH materials release as those track segments covered by paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, where such other track segments are similar to those covered by paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section.\n\n(D) Failure to submit sufficient information will result in the denial of any request under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii). If the request is granted, on and after the date the line would have otherwise been required to be equipped under the schedule contained in the PTCIP and approved by FRA, operations on the line shall be conducted in accordance with any conditions attached to the grant, including implementation of proposed mitigations as applicable.\n\n(5) Line sales.  FRA does not approve removal of a line from the PTCIP exclusively based upon a representation that a track segment will be abandoned or sold to another railroad. In the event a track segment is approved for abandonment or transfer by the Surface Transportation Board, FRA will review at the request of the transferring and acquiring railroads whether the requirement to install PTC on the line should be removed given all of the circumstances, including expected traffic and hazardous materials levels, reservation of trackage or haulage rights by the transferring railroad, routing analysis under part 172 of this chapter, commercial and real property arrangements affecting the transferring and acquiring railroads post-transfer, and such other factors as may be relevant to continue safe operations on the line. If FRA denies the request, the acquiring railroad shall install the PTC system on the schedule provided in the transferring railroad's PTCIP, without regard to whether it is a Class I railroad.\n\n(6) New rail passenger service.  No new intercity or commuter rail passenger service shall commence after December 31, 2020, until a PTC system certified under this subpart has been installed and made operative.\n\n(7) Implementation deadlines. (i) Each railroad must complete full implementation of its PTC system by December 31, 2018.\n\n(ii) A railroad is excepted from paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section and must complete full implementation of its PTC system by December 31, 2020, or the date specified in its approved alternative schedule and sequence, whichever is earlier, only if the railroad:\n\n(A) Installs all PTC hardware and acquires all spectrum necessary to implement its PTC system by December 31, 2018;\n\n(B) Submits an alternative schedule and sequence providing for implementation of positive train control system as soon as practicable, but not later than December 31, 2020;\n\n(C) Notifies the Associate Administrator in writing that it is prepared for review of its alternative schedule and sequence under 49 U.S.C. 20157(a)(3)(B); and\n\n(D) Receives FRA approval of its alternative schedule and sequence.\n\n(iii) If a railroad meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, the railroad must adhere to its approved alternative schedule and sequence and any of its subsequently approved amendments or required modifications.\n\n(c) Hazard detectors. (1) All hazard detectors integrated into a signal or train control system on or after October 16, 2008, shall be integrated into PTC systems required by this subpart; and their warnings shall be appropriately and timely enforced as described in the applicable PTCSP.\n\n(2) The applicable PTCSP must provide for receipt and presentation to the locomotive engineer and other train crew members of warnings from any additional hazard detectors using the PTC data network, onboard displays, and audible alerts. If the PTCSP so provides, the action to be taken by the system and by the crew members shall be specified.\n\n(3) The PTCDP (as applicable) and PTCSP for any new service described in \u00a7 236.1007 to be conducted above 90 miles per hour shall include a hazard analysis describing the hazards relevant to the specific route(s) in question (e.g., potential for track obstruction due to events such as falling rock or undermining of the track structure due to high water or displacement of a bridge over navigable waters), the basis for decisions concerning hazard detectors provided, and the manner in which such additional hazard detectors will be interfaced with the PTC system.\n\n(d) Event recorders. (1) Each lead locomotive, as defined in part 229, of a train equipped and operating with a PTC system required by this subpart must be equipped with an operative event recorder, which shall:\n\n(i) Record safety-critical train control data routed to the locomotive engineer's display that the engineer is required to comply with;\n\n(ii) Specifically include text messages conveying mandatory directives, maximum authorized speeds, PTC system brake warnings, PTC system brake enforcements, and the state of the PTC system (e.g., cut in, cut out, active, or failed); and\n\n(iii) Include examples of how the captured data will be displayed during playback along with the format, content, and data retention duration requirements specified in the PTCSP submitted and approved pursuant to this paragraph. If such train control data can be calibrated against other data required by this part, it may, at the election of the railroad, be retained in a separate memory module.\n\n(2) Each lead locomotive, as defined in part 229, manufactured and in service after October 1, 2009, that is equipped and operating with a PTC system required by this subpart, shall be equipped with an event recorder memory module meeting the crash hardening requirements of \u00a7 229.135 of this chapter.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subpart excepts compliance with any of the event recorder requirements contained in \u00a7 229.135 of this chapter.\n\n(e) Switch position.  The following requirements apply with respect to determining proper switch position under this section. When a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train's route in advance of the train's movement, the PTC system will provide warning of the condition associated with the following enforcement:\n\n(1) A PTC system shall enforce restricted speed over any switch:\n\n(i) Where train movements are made with the benefit of the indications of a wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety proposed to FRA and approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with this part; and\n\n(ii) Where wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety, requires the train to be operated at restricted speed.\n\n(2) A PTC system shall enforce a positive stop short of any main line switch, and any switch on a siding where the allowable speed is in excess of 20 miles per hour, if movement of the train over the switch:\n\n(i) Is made without the benefit of the indications of a wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety proposed to FRA and approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with this part; or\n\n(ii) Would create an unacceptable risk. Unacceptable risk includes conditions when traversing the switch, even at low speeds, could result in direct conflict with the movement of another train (including a hand-operated crossover between main tracks, a hand-operated crossover between a main track and an adjoining siding or auxiliary track, or a hand-operated switch providing access to another subdivision or branch line, etc.).\n\n(3) A PTC system required by this subpart shall be designed, installed, and maintained to perform the switch position detection and enforcement described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, except as provided for and justified in the applicable, FRA approved PTCDP or PTCSP.\n\n(4) The control circuit or electronic equivalent for all movement authorities over any switches, movable-point frogs, or derails shall be selected through circuit controller or functionally equivalent device operated directly by the switch points, derail, or by switch locking mechanism, or through relay or electronic device controlled by such circuit controller or functionally equivalent device, for each switch, movable-point frog, or derail in the route governed. Circuits or electronic equivalent shall be arranged so that any movement authorities less restrictive than those prescribed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section can only be provided when each switch, movable-point frog, or derail in the route governed is in proper position, and shall be in accordance with subparts A through G of this part, unless it is otherwise provided in a PTCSP approved under this subpart.\n\n(f) Train-to-train collision.  A PTC system shall be considered to be configured to prevent train-to-train collisions within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section if trains are required to be operated at restricted speed and if the onboard PTC equipment enforces the upper limits of the railroad's restricted speed rule (15 or 20 miles per hour). This application applies to:\n\n(1) Operating conditions under which trains are required by signal indication or operating rule to:\n\n(i) Stop before continuing; or\n\n(ii) Reduce speed to restricted speed and continue at restricted speed until encountering a more favorable indication or as provided by operating rule.\n\n(2) Operation of trains within the limits of a joint mandatory directive.\n\n(g) Temporary rerouting.  A train equipped with a PTC system as required by this subpart may be temporarily rerouted onto a track not equipped with a PTC system and a train not equipped with a PTC system may be temporarily rerouted onto a track equipped with a PTC system as required by this subpart in the following circumstances:\n\n(1) Emergencies.  In the event of an emergency\u2014including conditions such as derailment, flood, fire, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, or other similar circumstance outside of the railroad's control\u2014that would prevent usage of the regularly used track if:\n\n(i) The rerouting is applicable only until the emergency condition ceases to exist and for no more than 14 consecutive calendar days, unless otherwise extended by approval of the Associate Administrator;\n\n(ii) The railroad provides written or telephonic notification to the applicable Regional Administrator of the information listed in paragraph (i) of this section within one business day of the beginning of the rerouting made in accordance with this paragraph; and\n\n(iii) The conditions contained in paragraph (j) of this section are followed.\n\n(2) Planned maintenance.  In the event of planned maintenance that would prevent usage of the regularly used track if:\n\n(i) The maintenance period does not exceed 30 days;\n\n(ii) A request is filed with the applicable Regional Administrator in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section no less than 10 business days prior to the planned rerouting; and\n\n(iii) The conditions contained in paragraph (j) of this section are followed.\n\n(h) Rerouting requests. (1) For the purposes of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the rerouting request shall be self-executing unless the applicable Regional Administrator responds with a notice disapproving of the rerouting or providing instructions to allow rerouting. Such instructions may include providing additional information to the Regional Administrator or Associate Administrator prior to the commencement of rerouting. Once the Regional Administrator responds with a notice under this paragraph, no rerouting may occur until the Regional Administrator or Associate Administrator provides his or her approval.\n\n(2) In the event the temporary rerouting described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is to exceed 30 consecutive calendar days:\n\n(i) The railroad shall provide a request in accordance with paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section with the Associate Administrator no less than 10 business days prior to the planned rerouting; and\n\n(ii) The rerouting shall not commence until receipt of approval from the Associate Administrator.\n\n(i) Content of rerouting request.

                "question": "Does PTC prevent all of the four accident types where PTC is installed?",
                "answer": "PTC systems are designed (and implemented) to reliably and functionally prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work zones, and movements of trains through switches left in the wrong position. However, there are some events where PTC, as designed, is not able to prevent an accident:\n\n- Train-to-train collisions at or below restricted speed: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to a train moving through a red signal. But there are operating rules that in some cases, allow a train to pass a red signal, with approval, at restricted speed. PTC will enforce the upper limit of restricted speed, which is 20 miles per hour (mph) or 15 mph, per the railroad\u2019s operating rules. There have been some instances where a rear-end collision has occurred when a train is operating at or below restricted speed, when there was limited visibility, and the train operator did not operate the train ready to stop within one-half the range of vision.\n\n- Overspeed derailments at or below restricted speed: PTC is required to enforce civil speed limits, slow orders, and excessive speeds over switches and through turnouts. As noted above, PTC enforces the upper limit of restricted speed. However, PTC will not necessarily prevent an overspeed movement through a turnout within a restricted speed area if the maximum speed of the turnout is below the maximum restricted speed threshold.\n\n- Incursion into an established work zone: PTC enforces a positive stop prior to entering an established work zone. There have been several near-misses between a train and maintenance of way (MOW) workers when the MOW workers inadvertently located themselves outside the established work zone or, alternatively, did not properly establish a work zone.\n\n- Movement through a switch in the wrong position: PTC is required to enforce restricted speed when a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train\u2019s route in advance of the train\u2019s movement, if there is a wayside or cab signal system. As noted above, PTC enforces the upper limit of restricted speed. There have been some instances where a train has derailed due to the movement through a misaligned switch, noting that depending on visibility and terrain, the train operator must operate the train ready to stop within one-half the range of vision.\n\nFRA reminds the industry that Restricted speed means a speed that will permit a train or other equipment to stop within one-half the range of vision of the person operating the train or other equipment, but not exceeding 20 mph, unless further restricted by the operating rules of the railroad. 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 236.812, 236.1003.",

Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, each Class I railroad and each railroad providing or hosting intercity or commuter passenger service shall progressively equip its lines as provided in its approved PTCIP such that a PTC system certified under \u00a7 236.1015 is installed and operated by the host railroad on each:\n\n(i) Main line over which is transported any quantity of material poisonous by inhalation (PIH), including anhydrous ammonia, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 171.8, 173.115 and 173.132 of this title;\n\n(ii) Main line used for regularly provided intercity or commuter passenger service, except as provided in \u00a7 236.1019; and\n\n(iii) Additional line of railroad as required by the applicable FRA approved PTCIP, this subpart, or an FRA order requiring installation of a PTC system by that date.\n\n(2) Initial baseline identification of lines.  For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the baseline information necessary to determine whether a Class I railroad's track segment shall be equipped with a PTC system shall be determined and reported as follows:\n\n(i) The traffic density threshold of 5 million gross tons shall be based upon calendar year 2008 gross tonnage, except to the extent that traffic may fall below 5 million gross tons for two consecutive calendar years and a PTCIP or an RFA reflecting this change is filed and approved under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and, if applicable, \u00a7 236.1021.\n\n(ii) The presence or absence of any quantity of PIH hazardous materials shall be determined by whether one or more cars containing such product(s) was transported over the track segment in calendar year 2008 or prior to the filing of the PTCIP, except to the extent that the PTCIP or RFA justifies, under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, removal of the subject track segment from the PTCIP listing of lines to be equipped.\n\n(3) Addition of track segments.  To the extent increases in freight rail traffic occur subsequent to calendar year 2008 that might affect the requirement to install a PTC system on any line not yet equipped, the railroad shall seek to amend its PTCIP by promptly filing an RFA in accordance with \u00a7 236.1021. The following criteria apply:\n\n(i) If rail traffic exceeds 5 million gross tons in any year after 2008, the tonnage shall be calculated for the preceding two calendar years and if the total tonnage for those two calendar years exceeds 10 million gross tons, a PTCIP or its amendment is required.\n\n(ii) If PIH traffic is carried on a track segment as a result of a request for rail service or rerouting warranted under part 172 of this title, and if the line carries in excess of 5 million gross tons of rail traffic as determined under this paragraph, a PTCIP or its amendment is required. This does not apply when temporary rerouting is authorized in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n(iii) Once a railroad is notified by FRA that its RFA filed in accordance with this paragraph has been approved, the railroad shall equip the line with the applicable PTC system by December 31, 2015, or within 24 months, whichever is later.\n\n(4) Exclusion or removal of track segments from PTC baseline \u2014(i) Routing changes.  In a PTCIP or an RFA, a railroad may request review of the requirement to install PTC on a track segment where a PTC system is otherwise required by this section, but has not yet been installed, based upon changes in rail traffic such as reductions in total traffic volume to a level below 5 million gross tons annually, cessation of passenger service or the approval of an MTEA, or the cessation of PIH materials traffic. Any such request shall be accompanied by estimated traffic projections for the next 5 years (e.g., as a result of planned rerouting, coordinations, or location of new business on the line).\n\n(ii) FRA will approve the exclusion requested pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section if the railroad establishes that, as of December 31, 2015:\n\n(A) No passenger service will be present on the involved track segment or the passenger service will be subject to an MTEA approved in accordance with 49 CFR 236.1019; and\n\n(B) No PIH traffic will be present on the involved track segment or the gross tonnage on the involved track segment will decline to below 5 million gross tons annually as computed over a 2-year period.\n\n(iii) Freight lines with de minimis risk not used for regularly provided intercity or commuter rail passenger service. (A) In a PTCIP or an RFA, a railroad may request review of the requirement to install a PTC system on a track segment where a PTC system is otherwise required by this section, but has not yet been installed, based upon the presence of a minimal quantity of PIH materials traffic. Any such request shall be accompanied by estimated traffic projections for the next 5 years (e.g., as a result of planned rerouting, coordination, or location of new business on the line). Where the request involves prior or planned rerouting of PIH materials traffic, the railroad must provide the information and analysis identified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. The submission shall also include a full description of potential safety hazards on the segment of track and fully describe train operations over the line. This paragraph does not apply to line segments used for commuter rail or intercity rail passenger service.\n\n(B) Absent special circumstances related to specific hazards presented by operations on the line segment, FRA will approve a request for relief under this paragraph for a rail line segment that meets all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) That carries less than 15 million gross tons annually;\n\n(2) That does not have a heavy grade as \u201cheavy grade\u201d is defined in \u00a7 232.407 of this chapter for any train operating over the track segment;\n\n(3) Where the railroad adopts and complies with an operating rule requiring the crew of any train approaching working limits established under part 214 of this chapter to notify the roadway worker in charge of the train's approach at least 2 miles in advance of the working limits or, if the train crew does not have advance knowledge of the working limits, as soon as practical;\n\n(4) That carries fewer than 100 cars containing PIH materials per year, excluding those cars containing only a residue, as defined in \u00a7 171.8 of this title, of PIH materials;\n\n(5) That carries 2 or fewer trains per day carrying any quantity of PIH materials;\n\n(6) Where trains carrying any quantity of PIH materials operate at speeds not to exceed 40 miles per hour; and\n\n(7) Where any train transporting a car containing any quantity of PIH materials is operated with a vacant block ahead of and behind the train.\n\n(C) FRA may, in its discretion, approve other track segments not used for regularly provided intercity or commuter passenger service that have posed an equivalent or lesser level of risk of a PTC-preventable accident or PIH materials release as those track segments covered by paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, where such other track segments are similar to those covered by paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section.\n\n(D) Failure to submit sufficient information will result in the denial of any request under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii). If the request is granted, on and after the date the line would have otherwise been required to be equipped under the schedule contained in the PTCIP and approved by FRA, operations on the line shall be conducted in accordance with any conditions attached to the grant, including implementation of proposed mitigations as applicable.\n\n(5) Line sales.  FRA does not approve removal of a line from the PTCIP exclusively based upon a representation that a track segment will be abandoned or sold to another railroad. In the event a track segment is approved for abandonment or transfer by the Surface Transportation Board, FRA will review at the request of the transferring and acquiring railroads whether the requirement to install PTC on the line should be removed given all of the circumstances, including expected traffic and hazardous materials levels, reservation of trackage or haulage rights by the transferring railroad, routing analysis under part 172 of this chapter, commercial and real property arrangements affecting the transferring and acquiring railroads post-transfer, and such other factors as may be relevant to continue safe operations on the line. If FRA denies the request, the acquiring railroad shall install the PTC system on the schedule provided in the transferring railroad's PTCIP, without regard to whether it is a Class I railroad.\n\n(6) New rail passenger service.  No new intercity or commuter rail passenger service shall commence after December 31, 2020, until a PTC system certified under this subpart has been installed and made operative.\n\n(7) Implementation deadlines. (i) Each railroad must complete full implementation of its PTC system by December 31, 2018.\n\n(ii) A railroad is excepted from paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section and must complete full implementation of its PTC system by December 31, 2020, or the date specified in its approved alternative schedule and sequence, whichever is earlier, only if the railroad:\n\n(A) Installs all PTC hardware and acquires all spectrum necessary to implement its PTC system by December 31, 2018;\n\n(B) Submits an alternative schedule and sequence providing for implementation of positive train control system as soon as practicable, but not later than December 31, 2020;\n\n(C) Notifies the Associate Administrator in writing that it is prepared for review of its alternative schedule and sequence under 49 U.S.C. 20157(a)(3)(B); and\n\n(D) Receives FRA approval of its alternative schedule and sequence.\n\n(iii) If a railroad meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, the railroad must adhere to its approved alternative schedule and sequence and any of its subsequently approved amendments or required modifications.\n\n(c) Hazard detectors. (1) All hazard detectors integrated into a signal or train control system on or after October 16, 2008, shall be integrated into PTC systems required by this subpart; and their warnings shall be appropriately and timely enforced as described in the applicable PTCSP.\n\n(2) The applicable PTCSP must provide for receipt and presentation to the locomotive engineer and other train crew members of warnings from any additional hazard detectors using the PTC data network, onboard displays, and audible alerts. If the PTCSP so provides, the action to be taken by the system and by the crew members shall be specified.\n\n(3) The PTCDP (as applicable) and PTCSP for any new service described in \u00a7 236.1007 to be conducted above 90 miles per hour shall include a hazard analysis describing the hazards relevant to the specific route(s) in question (e.g., potential for track obstruction due to events such as falling rock or undermining of the track structure due to high water or displacement of a bridge over navigable waters), the basis for decisions concerning hazard detectors provided, and the manner in which such additional hazard detectors will be interfaced with the PTC system.\n\n(d) Event recorders. (1) Each lead locomotive, as defined in part 229, of a train equipped and operating with a PTC system required by this subpart must be equipped with an operative event recorder, which shall:\n\n(i) Record safety-critical train control data routed to the locomotive engineer's display that the engineer is required to comply with;\n\n(ii) Specifically include text messages conveying mandatory directives, maximum authorized speeds, PTC system brake warnings, PTC system brake enforcements, and the state of the PTC system (e.g., cut in, cut out, active, or failed); and\n\n(iii) Include examples of how the captured data will be displayed during playback along with the format, content, and data retention duration requirements specified in the PTCSP submitted and approved pursuant to this paragraph. If such train control data can be calibrated against other data required by this part, it may, at the election of the railroad, be retained in a separate memory module.\n\n(2) Each lead locomotive, as defined in part 229, manufactured and in service after October 1, 2009, that is equipped and operating with a PTC system required by this subpart, shall be equipped with an event recorder memory module meeting the crash hardening requirements of \u00a7 229.135 of this chapter.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subpart excepts compliance with any of the event recorder requirements contained in \u00a7 229.135 of this chapter.\n\n(e) Switch position.  The following requirements apply with respect to determining proper switch position under this section. When a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train's route in advance of the train's movement, the PTC system will provide warning of the condition associated with the following enforcement:\n\n(1) A PTC system shall enforce restricted speed over any switch:\n\n(i) Where train movements are made with the benefit of the indications of a wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety proposed to FRA and approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with this part; and\n\n(ii) Where wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety, requires the train to be operated at restricted speed.\n\n(2) A PTC system shall enforce a positive stop short of any main line switch, and any switch on a siding where the allowable speed is in excess of 20 miles per hour, if movement of the train over the switch:\n\n(i) Is made without the benefit of the indications of a wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety proposed to FRA and approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with this part; or\n\n(ii) Would create an unacceptable risk. Unacceptable risk includes conditions when traversing the switch, even at low speeds, could result in direct conflict with the movement of another train (including a hand-operated crossover between main tracks, a hand-operated crossover between a main track and an adjoining siding or auxiliary track, or a hand-operated switch providing access to another subdivision or branch line, etc.).\n\n(3) A PTC system required by this subpart shall be designed, installed, and maintained to perform the switch position detection and enforcement described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, except as provided for and justified in the applicable, FRA approved PTCDP or PTCSP.\n\n(4) The control circuit or electronic equivalent for all movement authorities over any switches, movable-point frogs, or derails shall be selected through circuit controller or functionally equivalent device operated directly by the switch points, derail, or by switch locking mechanism, or through relay or electronic device controlled by such circuit controller or functionally equivalent device, for each switch, movable-point frog, or derail in the route governed. Circuits or electronic equivalent shall be arranged so that any movement authorities less restrictive than those prescribed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section can only be provided when each switch, movable-point frog, or derail in the route governed is in proper position, and shall be in accordance with subparts A through G of this part, unless it is otherwise provided in a PTCSP approved under this subpart.\n\n(f) Train-to-train collision.  A PTC system shall be considered to be configured to prevent train-to-train collisions within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section if trains are required to be operated at restricted speed and if the onboard PTC equipment enforces the upper limits of the railroad's restricted speed rule (15 or 20 miles per hour). This application applies to:\n\n(1) Operating conditions under which trains are required by signal indication or operating rule to:\n\n(i) Stop before continuing; or\n\n(ii) Reduce speed to restricted speed and continue at restricted speed until encountering a more favorable indication or as provided by operating rule.\n\n(2) Operation of trains within the limits of a joint mandatory directive.\n\n(g) Temporary rerouting.  A train equipped with a PTC system as required by this subpart may be temporarily rerouted onto a track not equipped with a PTC system and a train not equipped with a PTC system may be temporarily rerouted onto a track equipped with a PTC system as required by this subpart in the following circumstances:\n\n(1) Emergencies.  In the event of an emergency\u2014including conditions such as derailment, flood, fire, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, or other similar circumstance outside of the railroad's control\u2014that would prevent usage of the regularly used track if:\n\n(i) The rerouting is applicable only until the emergency condition ceases to exist and for no more than 14 consecutive calendar days, unless otherwise extended by approval of the Associate Administrator;\n\n(ii) The railroad provides written or telephonic notification to the applicable Regional Administrator of the information listed in paragraph (i) of this section within one business day of the beginning of the rerouting made in accordance with this paragraph; and\n\n(iii) The conditions contained in paragraph (j) of this section are followed.\n\n(2) Planned maintenance.  In the event of planned maintenance that would prevent usage of the regularly used track if:\n\n(i) The maintenance period does not exceed 30 days;\n\n(ii) A request is filed with the applicable Regional Administrator in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section no less than 10 business days prior to the planned rerouting; and\n\n(iii) The conditions contained in paragraph (j) of this section are followed.\n\n(h) Rerouting requests. (1) For the purposes of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the rerouting request shall be self-executing unless the applicable Regional Administrator responds with a notice disapproving of the rerouting or providing instructions to allow rerouting. Such instructions may include providing additional information to the Regional Administrator or Associate Administrator prior to the commencement of rerouting. Once the Regional Administrator responds with a notice under this paragraph, no rerouting may occur until the Regional Administrator or Associate Administrator provides his or her approval.\n\n(2) In the event the temporary rerouting described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is to exceed 30 consecutive calendar days:\n\n(i) The railroad shall provide a request in accordance with paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section with the Associate Administrator no less than 10 business days prior to the planned rerouting; and\n\n(ii) The rerouting shall not commence until receipt of approval from the Associate Administrator.\n\n(i) Content of rerouting request.  Each notice or request referenced in paragraph (g) and (h) of this section must indicate:\n\n(1) The dates that such temporary rerouting will occur;\n\n(2) The number and types of trains that will be rerouted;\n\n(3) The location of the affected tracks; and\n\n(4) A description of the necessity for the temporary rerouting.\n\n(j) Rerouting conditions.  Rerouting of operations under paragraph (g) of this section may occur under the following conditions:\n\n(1) Where a train not equipped with a PTC system is rerouted onto a track equipped with a PTC system, or a train not equipped with a PTC system that is compatible and functionally responsive to the PTC system utilized on the line to which the train is being rerouted, the train shall be operated in accordance with \u00a7 236.1029; or\n\n(2) Where any train is rerouted onto a track not equipped with a PTC system, the train shall be operated in accordance with the operating rules applicable to the line on which the train is rerouted.\n\n(k) Rerouting cessation.  The applicable Regional Administrator may order a railroad to cease any rerouting provided under paragraph (g) or (h) of this section.\n\n[75 FR 2699, Jan. 15, 2010, as amended at 75 FR 59117, Sept. 27, 2010; 77 FR 28305, May 14, 2012; 79 FR 49716, Aug. 22, 2014; 81 FR 10128, Feb. 29, 2016]\n\n\u00a7 236.812\nSpeed, restricted.\n\nA speed that will permit stopping within one-half the range of vision, but not exceeding 20 miles per hour.\n\n[49 FR 3388, Jan. 26, 1984]\n\n\u00a7 236.1003\nDefinitions.\n\n(a) Definitions contained in subparts G and H of this part apply equally to this subpart.\n\n(b) The following definitions apply to terms used only in this subpart unless otherwise stated:\n\nAfter-arrival mandatory directive   means an authority to occupy a track which is issued to a train that is not effective and not to be acted upon until after the arrival and passing of a train, or trains, specifically identified in the authority.\n\nAssociate Administrator   means the FRA Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety/Chief Safety Officer.\n\nClass I railroad   means a railroad which in the last year for which revenues were reported exceeded the threshold established under regulations of the Surface Transportation Board (49 CFR part 1201.1-1 (2008)).\n\nCleartext   means the un-encrypted text in its original, human readable, form.

                "answer": "In general, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20157(h) requires FRA to certify that a host railroad\u2019s PTC system complies with FRA\u2019s PTC regulations, before the technology may be operated in revenue service. Before a railroad can make certain changes to an FRA-certified PTC system or the associated FRA-approved PTCSP, a host railroad must submit, and obtain FRA\u2019s approval of, a request for amendment (RFA) to its PTCSP under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021.\n\nFRA\u2019s regulations at 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(h) identify the types of proposed changes that trigger the filing of an RFA to a railroad\u2019s PTC system and PTCSP. Specifically, a railroad is required to submit this type of RFA, for FRA\u2019s review and approval, if the railroad seeks to:\n\n- Modify a safety-critical element of its PTC system; or\n- Modify its PTC system in a way that would affect the safety-critical functionality of any other PTC system with which it interoperates.\n\nFRA\u2019s regulations provide, under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(e), that FRA will publish a notice in the Federal Register and invite public comment on these RFAs. As such, the public has an opportunity to review a railroad\u2019s incoming RFA and submit comments to FRA during the timeframe specified in the Federal Register notice. FRA reviews any submitted comments during its review-and-decision process.\n\nFRA is required by regulation to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a railroad\u2019s RFA to its PTCSP within 45 days of the date on which the RFA was filed under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(m). A railroad\u2019s incoming RFA and FRA\u2019s decision letters are available to the public in the respective railroad\u2019s PTC docket on regulations.gov. Hyperlinks to railroads\u2019 PTC dockets are available at https://railroads.dot.gov/train-control/ptc/ptc-annual-and-quarterly-reports.\n\nIn addition, railroads are required to submit RFAs to their PTCIPs, subject to FRA\u2019s review and approval, for certain types of proposed changes, including if a railroad seeks to:\n\n- Initiate a new category of service (e.g., passenger or freight);\n- Add, subtract, or otherwise materially modify one or more lines of railroad which implementation of a PTC system is required; or\n- Decrease the PTC system\u2019s limits (e.g., by excluding or removing a PTC system from a track segment).",

                "answer": "Yes. Section 1304(e) amends 23 U.S.C. 139(e) by adding: (1) an application review requirement, which requires the Federal lead agency to determine whether to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process (including project readiness), 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(3), and (2) a lead agency designation request process, 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4).\n\n**Review of Project Initiation Application**\nSection 1304(e)(2) adds a new step in the project initiation process. The Federal lead agency or the Secretary (when a Federal lead agency has not been identified) must provide a written response to the project sponsor no later than 45 days after the date on which it receives a project initiation notice (see 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(3)). The written response must either: (1) describe the determination to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process or to decline the application with an explanation for that decision; or (2) request additional information necessary to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process. The Agencies recommend contacting the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) to discuss the proposed project\u2019s details and the Federal lead agency\u2019s preferences before formally submitting the project notification.\n\nWhen submitting a project initiation notice, a project sponsor must continue to provide the project\u2019s type of work, termini, length, general location, and anticipated Federal approvals. However, section 1304(e)(1) clarifies that the project sponsor may provide any additional information it considers important when it proposes to initiate the Section 139 environmental review process for the proposed project. 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(1).\n\n**Request to Designate a Lead Agency**\nSection 1304(e)(2) also establishes a new 'lead agency designation' process (see 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4)). Under this process, a project sponsor may submit a request to the Secretary to designate the operating administration or secretarial office within U.S. DOT with the expertise on the proposed project to serve as the Federal lead agency. The Secretary must respond to the request no later than 45 days after the date of receipt of the request. The response must:\n\n- Approve or deny the request. If the Secretary denies the request, the response must include an explanation for the denial; or\n- Require the project sponsor to submit additional information. If the project sponsor submits additional information, then the Secretary must respond to the submission no later than 45 days after the date of the receipt of the new information.\n\nAlthough project sponsors have the option to request a lead agency designation from the Secretary under 23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4), the Agencies recommend that project sponsors first contact the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) (i.e., FHWA, FRA, or FTA) to discuss the project. Where a lead agency is not readily identified, the Agencies will informally consult with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy (OST). For most projects, informal discussions with the potential Federal lead agency (or agencies) will result in the identification of the Federal lead agency without using the formal designation process.

                "answer": "Yes, section 1304(f)(2)(C) creates paragraph 23 U.S.C. 139(f)(4)(E), Reduction of Duplication. The new paragraph requires that the lead agency reduce duplication, to the maximum extent practicable, between the evaluation of alternatives under NEPA and the evaluation of alternatives under other processes (i.e., the metropolitan transportation planning process or the State environmental review process). The provision allows lead agencies to eliminate from detailed consideration an alternative proposed in an EIS if the lead agency determines the following conditions are met:\n\n- The alternative was considered in a metropolitan planning process or a State environmental review process by a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) or a State or local transportation agency, as applicable;\n\n- The lead agency provided guidance to the MPO or State or local transportation agency, as applicable, regarding the analysis of alternatives in the metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process, including guidance on the NEPA requirements and any other Federal law necessary for approval of the project;\n\n- The applicable metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process included an opportunity for public review and comment;\n\n- The applicable MPO or State or local transportation agency rejected the alternative after considering public comments;\n\n- The Federal lead agency independently reviewed the alternative evaluation approved by the applicable MPO or State or local transportation agency; and\n\n- The Federal lead agency determined:\n\n  - In consultation with Federal participating or cooperating agencies, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for compliance with NEPA; or\n\n  - With the concurrence of Federal agencies with jurisdiction over a permit or approval required for a project, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for any permit or approval under any other Federal law. The Federal lead agency will provide this determination to the Federal agencies with jurisdiction over a permit or approval required for the project. If the Federal lead agency does not receive a written response within the time period specified in the request for concurrence (typically no more than 30 days, consistent with 23 U.S.C. 139(g)(2)(B)), it will assume concurrence.\n\nThis process does not eliminate the applicability of 23 CFR 450.212 and 450.318 to support the elimination of alternatives.",

                "answer": "- 'Existing freight operations' on a track means that the track is used at the present time by regular freight rail traffic (i.e., revenue freight trains carrying goods or returning from delivering goods on behalf of shippers).\n\n- Use of one or more tracks passing through a station and adjacent to a platform for other purposes (including but not limited to use of maintenance equipment by a freight railroad, the rare or token passage of freight trains, storage of ballast cars, movement of private passenger cars, or use of tracks to park freight trains overnight) does not constitute 'existing freight operations' because these activities do not meet any plausible definition of 'freight rail traffic.'\n\n- In addition, where stations serve lines shared by passenger and freight traffic, and a freight train can bypass the track adjacent to the new or altered passenger platform via a gauntlet or other available track such that the freight train does not need to use the track adjacent to the platform, level-entry boarding is required. This means that even if freight trains could access a track adjacent to a passenger platform via a diverging track or other access point but does not have to do so because other tracks exist for freight passage through the station, level entry boarding is required. This also means that track adjacent to a passenger platform track that would be accessed via a diverging move off the main freight line would never be construed to carry freight rail traffic, and therefore, level-entry boarding is always required at such a platform.\n\n- If more than one platform exists in the station and the station has multiple tracks available to freight trains, only a platform adjacent to a track actually used for freight rail traffic would not need to provide level-entry boarding. Other platforms at the station must provide level-entry boarding.\n\n- The possibility that a freight railroad could use a track for freight rail traffic at some time in the future does not mean that there are 'existing' freight operations.\n\n- Where freight trains have not used a track passing through a station for a significant length of time (e.g., as noted in the Preamble to the rule, 10 years), the Department treats the situation as not constituting 'existing' freight operations. However, entities should be aware that the example provided of '10 years' is as an illustration only. There may be occasions when a railroad not using tracks for freight train service over a period of less than 10 years would still constitute a significant length of time, depending on all the circumstances\u2014e.g., when a freight customer no longer exists for a particular line. In such a case, the Department would regard the track as not being used for 'existing' freight traffic on that track.",

                "question": "What is the minimum width needed for a non-level boarding railroad passenger station platform to meet the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?",
                "answer": "Under 49 CFR Part 37, all new or altered railroad station platforms, including non-level boarding platforms, used for intercity rail passenger service or commuter rail passenger service must be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including persons who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or walkers. 49 CFR 37.9, 37.41-37.43, 37.55. We have received questions from entities constructing or altering platforms regarding the minimum platform width needed to accommodate passengers using such mobility aid devices. This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for non-level boarding platforms.\n\nWhere non-level boarding platforms exist, on-board lifts may be used to move passengers who cannot climb stairs from the platform level up to the passenger car. 49 CFR 37.165(g). The actual design of the platform lift mechanism varies from one builder to another, but it is not uncommon for the passenger car edge of the lift platform in the fully deployed position to be a number of inches away from the actual side of the passenger car body. An allowance of 1 foot from the side of the passenger car to the edge of the lift platform has been made to accommodate various lifting mechanism designs. The lifting platform cannot be more than 3 inches above the platform in the down position with a connecting ramp slope not exceeding 1:8 (49 CFR 38.95(b)(8), 38.125(b)(8)), which could result in a ramp to the lift platform being a maximum of 24 inches long. Per section 304.3 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a person using a wheelchair to turn and enter the on-board lift.\n\nFor a new or altered conventional non-level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width thus should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above \u2013 12 feet.\n\nFor a non-level boarding end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 14 feet for an end loading island platform.\n\nFor a non-level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalator, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access feature (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42 for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet. The non-level boarding platform may be tapered to 14 feet at the end(s) of the platform.",

The railroad operator must submit a copy of this analysis to FTA or FRA at the time it submits the plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) The railroad operator must submit a plan to FRA and/or FTA, describing its proposed means to meet the performance standard of paragraph (a) of this section at that station. The plan must demonstrate how boarding equipment or platforms would be deployed, maintained, and operated; and how personnel would be trained and deployed to ensure that service to individuals with disabilities is provided in an integrated, safe, timely, and reliable manner.\n\n(3) Before proceeding with constructing or modifying a station platform covered by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the railroad must obtain approval from the FTA (for commuter rail systems) or the FRA (for intercity rail systems). The agencies will evaluate the proposed plan and may approve, disapprove, or modify it. The FTA and the FRA may make this determination jointly in any situation in which both a commuter rail system and an intercity or high-speed rail system use the tracks serving the platform. FTA and FRA will respond to the railroad's plan in a timely manner, in accordance with the timetable set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(iii) of this paragraph.\n\n(i) FTA/FRA will provide an initial written response within 30 days of receiving a railroad's written proposal. This response will say either that the submission is complete or that additional information is needed.\n\n(ii) Once a complete package, including any requested additional information, is received, as acknowledged by FRA/FTA in writing, FRA/FTA will provide a substantive response accepting, rejecting, or modifying the proposal within 120 days.\n\n(iii) If FTA/FRA needs additional time to consider the railroad's proposal, FRA/FTA will provide a written communication to the railroad setting forth the reasons for the delay and an estimate of the additional time (not to exceed an additional 60 days) that FRA/FTA expect to take to finalize a substantive response to the proposal.\n\n(iv) In reviewing the plan, FRA and FTA will consider factors including, but not limited to, how the proposal maximizes accessibility to individuals with disabilities, any obstacles to the use of a method that could provide better service to individuals with disabilities, the safety and reliability of the approach and related technology proposed to be used, the suitability of the means proposed to the station and line and/or system on which it would be used, and the adequacy of equipment and maintenance and staff training and deployment.\n\n(e) In any situation using a combination of high and low platforms, a commuter or intercity rail operator shall not employ a solution that has the effect of channeling passengers into a narrow space between the face of the higher-level platform and the edge of the lower platform.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this paragraph, any obstructions on a platform (mini-high platforms, stairwells, elevator shafts, seats etc.) shall be set at least six feet back from the edge of a platform.\n\n(2) If the six-foot clearance is not feasible (e.g., where such a clearance would create an insurmountable gap on a mini-high platform or where the physical structure of an existing station does not allow such clearance), barriers must be used to prevent the flow of pedestrian traffic through these narrower areas.\n\n(f) For purposes of this part, level-entry boarding means a boarding platform design in which the horizontal gap between a car at rest and the platform is no more than 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and the vertical height of the car floor is no more than 5.5 inches above the boarding platform. Where the horizontal gap is more than 3 inches and/or the vertical gap is more than 5\u20448 inch, measured when the vehicle is at rest, the horizontal and vertical gaps between the car floor and the boarding platform must be mitigated by a bridge plate, ramp, or other appropriate device consistent with 49 CFR 38.95(c) and 38.125(c).\n\n[76 FR 57935, Sept. 19, 2011]\n\n"

                "question": "What is the minimum width needed for a level boarding railroad passenger station platform to meet the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?",
                "answer": "Under 49 CFR Part 37, all new or altered railroad station platforms, including non-level boarding platforms, used for intercity rail passenger service or commuter rail passenger service must be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including persons who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or walkers. 49 CFR 37.9, 37.41-37.43, 37.55. We have received questions from entities constructing or altering platforms as to the minimum platform width needed to accommodate passengers using such mobility aid devices. This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for level boarding platforms.\n\nA level boarding intercity or commuter railroad passenger station platform can have a gap between the passenger car door threshold and the edge of the platform that is at the maximum horizontal dimension of 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and a maximum vertical dimension of 5.5 inches. 49 CFR 37.42(f). At level boarding platforms, where the gap exceeds plus or minus 5/8 inch vertical or 3 inches horizontal (49 CFR 37.42(f)), a bridge plate is typically used to allow a passenger using a wheelchair or other mobility device to move from the platform to the passenger car. While they can vary in dimensions, a typical bridge plate is approximately 3 feet long. Per ADAAG 304.3, a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a passenger using a wheelchair to make a turn to enter the bridge plate and onto the passenger car.\n\nFor a conventional level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or a wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above \u2013 i.e., 8 feet.\n\nFor an end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 10 feet for an end loading level boarding island platform.\n\nFor a level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalators, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access facility (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42(e)(1) for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet. The level boarding island with vertical pedestrian access platform may be tapered to 10 feet at the end(s) of the platform, as long as the gap between the car and the platform through the curved portion complies with 49 CFR 37.42(f), which defines the maximum allowable gap at level boarding platforms to be 10 inches on tangent and 13 inches on curved tracks.\n\nCircumstances may arise where a 15-inch high passenger platform designed to provide level boarding to typical bi-level passenger cars is also used by conventional single level passenger cars, which typically have 51-inch car door heights. In this case, the 3 feet allocated for a bridge plate should be replaced by either the 5 feet used by an on-board lift or 4 feet used by a platform mounted lift. Thus, a 15-inch high platform used by single level passenger cars should be treated as if it were a non-level boarding platform.",

                "answer": "\u201cExisting freight operations\u201d on a track means that the track is used at the present time by regular freight rail traffic (i.e., revenue freight trains carrying goods or returning from delivering goods on behalf of shippers).\n\nUse of one or more tracks passing through a station and adjacent to a platform for other purposes (including but not limited to use of maintenance equipment by a freight railroad, the rare or token passage of freight trains, storage of ballast cars, movement of private passenger cars, or use of tracks to park freight trains overnight) does not constitute \u201cexisting freight operations\u201d because these activities do not meet any plausible definition of \u201cfreight rail traffic.\u201d\n\nIn addition, where stations serve lines shared by passenger and freight traffic, and a freight train can bypass the track adjacent to the new or altered passenger platform via a gauntlet or other available track such that the freight train does not need to use the track adjacent to the platform, level-entry boarding is required. This means that even if freight trains could access a track adjacent to a passenger platform via a diverging track or other access point but does not have to do so because other tracks exist for freight passage through the station, level-entry boarding is required. This also means that track adjacent to a passenger platform track that would be accessed via a diverging move off the main freight line would never be construed to carry freight rail traffic, and therefore, level-entry boarding is always required at such a platform.\n\nIf more than one platform exists in the station and the station has multiple tracks available to freight trains, only a platform adjacent to a track actually used for freight rail traffic would not need to provide level-entry boarding. Other platforms at the station must provide level-entry boarding.\n\nThe possibility that a freight railroad could use a track for freight rail traffic at some time in the future does not mean that there are \u201cexisting\u201d freight operations.\n\nWhere freight trains have not used a track passing through a station for a significant length of time (e.g., as noted in the Preamble to the rule, 10 years), the Department treats the situation as not constituting \u201cexisting\u201d freight operations. However, entities should be aware that the example provided of \u201c10 years\u201d is as an illustration only. There may be occasions when a railroad not using tracks for freight train service over a period of less than 10 years would still constitute a significant length of time, depending on all the circumstances\u2014e.g., when a freight customer no longer exists for a particular line. In such a case, the Department would regard the track as not being used for \u201cexisting\u201d freight traffic on that track.",

FRA and/or FTA will address such unusual situations on a case-by-case basis, as needed.\n\nBecause of these requirements, when an intercity or commuter railroad constructs or alters a platform, it must ensure the platform is at least 8 inches ATR. Note that alterations to parts of a station other than the platform do not trigger this requirement.\n\nIn addition to this basic facility accessibility requirement, section 37.42 requires a railroad that alters a station platform and does not provide level boarding to ensure that passengers with disabilities can board any accessible car of a train available to other passengers at that station, using means including car-borne lifts, station-based lifts, or mini-high platforms. Meeting this requirement does not exempt the railroad from the separate requirement to ensure that an altered or newly constructed platform is at least 8 inches ATR.\n\nWhile a platform 8 inches above ATR generally does not provide level boarding, a platform at this height does facilitate boarding by ambulatory passengers, including passengers (e.g., elderly persons) who might have difficulty ascending a vertical distance greater than the normal vertical gap between an 8-inch ATR platform and the first step of a railroad car.",
                "context": "\u00a7 37.41\nConstruction of transportation facilities by public entities.\n\n(a) A public entity shall construct any new facility to be used in providing designated public transportation services so that the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. This requirement also applies to the construction of a new station for use in intercity or commuter rail transportation. For purposes of this section, a facility or station is \u201cnew\u201d if its construction begins (i.e., issuance of notice to proceed) after January 25, 1992, or, in the case of intercity or commuter rail stations, after October 7, 1991.\n\n(b) (1) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\n\n(2) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.\n\n(3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.\n\n[56 FR 45621, Sept. 6, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 63266, Oct. 30, 2006]\n\n\u00a7 37.9(a)\nFor purposes of this part, a transportation facility shall be considered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if it meets the requirements of this part and the requirements set forth in Appendices B and D to 36 CFR part 1191, which apply to buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, as modified by Appendix A to this part.\n\n"

                "question": "Where the requirements of section 37.42 apply, which cars of a train does a railroad operator have to make available to passengers with disabilities?",
                "answer": "The performance standard of section 37.42(a) requires that passengers with disabilities \u201cmust have access to all accessible cars available to passengers without disabilities in each train using the station.\n\nThe standard applies only to \u201caccessible\u201d cars meeting the requirements of 49 CFR Part 38. Some railroads continue to operate a number of inaccessible cars (e.g., 1950s-era double-decker commuter cars) that people with mobility impairments cannot enter and use. The requirement does not apply to cars of this kind.\n\nMoreover, the standard applies only to \u201ccars available to passengers without disabilities\u201d at a given station. There can be a number of situations in which not all cars in a train are made available to anyone at a station.\n\nFor example, at a station with a relatively short platform, only cars 1-4 of an 8-car train may be available to any passenger. In some commuter rail systems, only two cars are open to be boarded by any passenger at a station.\n\nIn situations like these, only those cars that are made available to other passengers at the station have to be made available to passengers with disabilities. The railroad operator generally would not be required to make cars available to passengers with disabilities that are not made available to other passengers.\n\nHowever, if all wheelchair locations are occupied by other wheelchair users in cars where the doors normally open at a station, the Department expects the railroad operator to double-stop or move a lift, where necessary, in order to provide transportation to a wheelchair user in an unoccupied wheelchair location. (Of course, railroad operators are always responsible for moving passengers\u2019 luggage and other items out of wheelchair locations to permit their use by a wheelchair user.) Likewise, if the only way a passenger with a disability can access a food service car is through an adjacent car, then the railroad should provide access to the adjacent car.",

                "question": "What constitutes an alteration to a platform for purposes of triggering the application of section 37.42 requirements?",
                "answer": "Section 37.3 defines an alteration as \u201ca change to an existing facility including, but not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction . . . changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements . . . Normal maintenance . . . painting . . . or changes to mechanical or electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.\u201d\n\nIn the context of a railroad station platform, maintenance and repair activities, such as painting or fixing cracks, would generally not constitute an alteration. Adding accessibility features that do not affect the basic configuration of or access to the platform (e.g., adding a detectable warning strip along a platform edge, installing a public address system or visual paging system) would also not constitute an alteration.\n\nChanges that do affect the basic configuration of a platform or the ability of people with disabilities to have access to the platform would constitute an alteration.\n\nFor example, if the platform height relative to the top of rail is raised, if the old surface is removed and/or a new surface put down, or if there is a reconstruction of or structural change to the platform that affects its usability (e.g., to remedy significant degrading of the facility), there would be an alteration.",
