Section 37.165(c)(3) of the DOT ADA regulations allows a transit operator to establish a policy that requires all riders to have their wheelchairs secured while aboard a transit bus or van. Therefore, the operator may decline to provide service to a rider who refuses to allow his or her wheelchair to be secured. Alternatively, transit operators may adopt a policy that allows wheelchairs to ride unsecured. If the rider wishes his or her wheelchair to be secured, however, the operator\u2019s personnel must provide the requested assistance.

Securement systems on vehicles with GVWRs of up to 30,000 pounds, and their attachments to such vehicles, shall restrain a force in the forward longitudinal direction of up to 2,500 pounds per securement leg or clamping mechanism and a minimum of 5,000 pounds for each mobility aid.\n\n(2) Location and size.  The securement system shall be placed as near to the accessible entrance as practicable and shall have a clear floor area of 30 inches by 48 inches. Such space shall adjoin, and may overlap, an access path. Not more than 6 inches of the required clear floor space may be accommodated for footrests under another seat provided there is a minimum of 9 inches from the floor to the lowest part of the seat overhanging the space. Securement areas may have fold-down seats to accommodate other passengers when a wheelchair or mobility aid is not occupying the area, provided the seats, when folded up, do not obstruct the clear floor space required.

In vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length, at least one securement device or system required by paragraph (a) of this section shall secure the wheelchair or mobility aid facing toward the front of the vehicle. Additional securement devices or systems shall secure the wheelchair or mobility aid facing forward, or rearward with a padded barrier, extending from a height of 38 inches from the vehicle floor to a height of 56 inches from the vehicle floor with a width of 18 inches, laterally centered immediately in back of the seated individual. In vehicles 22 feet in length or less, the required securement device may secure the wheelchair or mobility aid either facing toward the front of the vehicle or facing rearward, with a padded barrier as described. Additional securement locations shall be either forward or rearward facing with a padded barrier. Such barriers need not be solid provided equivalent protection is afforded.\n\n(5) Movement.

                "answer": "Under the broad nondiscrimination provisions in Section 37.5 of the DOT ADA regulations, a transit operator is not permitted to mandate the use by wheelchair users of seat belts and shoulder harnesses, unless the operator mandates the use of these devices by all passengers, including those sitting in vehicle seats. For example, on fixed route buses, if none of the other passengers are required to wear shoulder belts then neither can the person in the mobility device be required to do so.\n\nTransit operators may establish a policy that requires the seat belt and shoulder harness to be used by all riders, including those who use wheelchairs as well as those who use vehicle seats, if seat belts and shoulder harnesses are provided at all seating locations. In some cases, state law could require an operator to adopt such a policy.\n\nWhen developing seat-belt-use policies, it must be stressed that Section 38.23(d)(7) prohibits the use of the seat belt and shoulder harness in lieu of securing the wheelchair itself. If the passenger\u2019s wheelchair cannot be secured, or cannot be secured adequately to the satisfaction of both passenger and transit personnel, the seat belt and shoulder harness must not be used.",

However, FRA\u2019s PTC regulations and the statutory mandate recognize that PTC technology may sometimes experience failures and be disabled.\n\nDisabling a PTC system without permission or circumventing a PTC enforcement is subject to civil penalty or disqualification for the responsible locomotive engineer or conductor. When PTC is disabled, the PTC system is unable to initiate the brakes to prevent a train-to-train collision, over-speed derailment, incursion into an established work zone, or the movement of a train through a switch left in the wrong position.\n\nIn 2023 and beyond, the only time a railroad may lawfully operate on PTC-mandated territory without a functioning PTC system is if the PTC system has failed en route, including malfunctions and other cut outs. In the instance of a PTC failure en route, the train may operate, with speed limitations, no farther than the next forward designed location for the repair or exchange of onboard PTC apparatuses.

                "answer": "In general, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20157(h) requires FRA to certify that a host railroad\u2019s PTC system complies with FRA\u2019s PTC regulations, before the technology may be operated in revenue service. Before a railroad can make certain changes to an FRA-certified PTC system or the associated FRA-approved PTCSP, a host railroad must submit, and obtain FRA\u2019s approval of, a request for amendment (RFA) to its PTCSP under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021.\n\nFRA\u2019s regulations at 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(h) identify the types of proposed changes that trigger the filing of an RFA to a railroad\u2019s PTC system and PTCSP. Specifically, a railroad is required to submit this type of RFA, for FRA\u2019s review and approval, if the railroad seeks to:\n\n- Modify a safety-critical element of its PTC system; or\n- Modify its PTC system in a way that would affect the safety-critical functionality of any other PTC system with which it interoperates.\n\nFRA\u2019s regulations provide, under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(e), that FRA will publish a notice in the Federal Register and invite public comment on these RFAs. As such, the public has an opportunity to review a railroad\u2019s incoming RFA and submit comments to FRA during the timeframe specified in the Federal Register notice. FRA reviews any submitted comments during its review-and-decision process.\n\nFRA is required by regulation to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a railroad\u2019s RFA to its PTCSP within 45 days of the date on which the RFA was filed under 49 CFR \u00a7 236.1021(m). A railroad\u2019s incoming RFA and FRA\u2019s decision letters are available to the public in the respective railroad\u2019s PTC docket on regulations.gov. Hyperlinks to railroads\u2019 PTC dockets are available at https://railroads.dot.gov/train-control/ptc/ptc-annual-and-quarterly-reports.\n\nIn addition, railroads are required to submit RFAs to their PTCIPs, subject to FRA\u2019s review and approval, for certain types of proposed changes, including if a railroad seeks to:\n\n- Initiate a new category of service (e.g., passenger or freight);\n- Add, subtract, or otherwise materially modify one or more lines of railroad which implementation of a PTC system is required; or\n- Decrease the PTC system\u2019s limits (e.g., by excluding or removing a PTC system from a track segment).",

                "question": "What is the minimum width needed for a non-level boarding railroad passenger station platform to meet the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?",
                "answer": "Under 49 CFR Part 37, all new or altered railroad station platforms, including non-level boarding platforms, used for intercity rail passenger service or commuter rail passenger service must be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including persons who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or walkers. 49 CFR 37.9, 37.41-37.43, 37.55. We have received questions from entities constructing or altering platforms regarding the minimum platform width needed to accommodate passengers using such mobility aid devices. This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for non-level boarding platforms.\n\nWhere non-level boarding platforms exist, on-board lifts may be used to move passengers who cannot climb stairs from the platform level up to the passenger car. 49 CFR 37.165(g). The actual design of the platform lift mechanism varies from one builder to another, but it is not uncommon for the passenger car edge of the lift platform in the fully deployed position to be a number of inches away from the actual side of the passenger car body. An allowance of 1 foot from the side of the passenger car to the edge of the lift platform has been made to accommodate various lifting mechanism designs. The lifting platform cannot be more than 3 inches above the platform in the down position with a connecting ramp slope not exceeding 1:8 (49 CFR 38.95(b)(8), 38.125(b)(8)), which could result in a ramp to the lift platform being a maximum of 24 inches long. Per section 304.3 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a person using a wheelchair to turn and enter the on-board lift.\n\nFor a new or altered conventional non-level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width thus should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above \u2013 12 feet.\n\nFor a non-level boarding end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 14 feet for an end loading island platform.\n\nFor a non-level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalator, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access feature (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42 for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet. The non-level boarding platform may be tapered to 14 feet at the end(s) of the platform.",

The railroad operator must submit a copy of this analysis to FTA or FRA at the time it submits the plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) The railroad operator must submit a plan to FRA and/or FTA, describing its proposed means to meet the performance standard of paragraph (a) of this section at that station. The plan must demonstrate how boarding equipment or platforms would be deployed, maintained, and operated; and how personnel would be trained and deployed to ensure that service to individuals with disabilities is provided in an integrated, safe, timely, and reliable manner.\n\n(3) Before proceeding with constructing or modifying a station platform covered by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the railroad must obtain approval from the FTA (for commuter rail systems) or the FRA (for intercity rail systems). The agencies will evaluate the proposed plan and may approve, disapprove, or modify it. The FTA and the FRA may make this determination jointly in any situation in which both a commuter rail system and an intercity or high-speed rail system use the tracks serving the platform. FTA and FRA will respond to the railroad's plan in a timely manner, in accordance with the timetable set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(iii) of this paragraph.\n\n(i) FTA/FRA will provide an initial written response within 30 days of receiving a railroad's written proposal. This response will say either that the submission is complete or that additional information is needed.\n\n(ii) Once a complete package, including any requested additional information, is received, as acknowledged by FRA/FTA in writing, FRA/FTA will provide a substantive response accepting, rejecting, or modifying the proposal within 120 days.\n\n(iii) If FTA/FRA needs additional time to consider the railroad's proposal, FRA/FTA will provide a written communication to the railroad setting forth the reasons for the delay and an estimate of the additional time (not to exceed an additional 60 days) that FRA/FTA expect to take to finalize a substantive response to the proposal.\n\n(iv) In reviewing the plan, FRA and FTA will consider factors including, but not limited to, how the proposal maximizes accessibility to individuals with disabilities, any obstacles to the use of a method that could provide better service to individuals with disabilities, the safety and reliability of the approach and related technology proposed to be used, the suitability of the means proposed to the station and line and/or system on which it would be used, and the adequacy of equipment and maintenance and staff training and deployment.\n\n(e) In any situation using a combination of high and low platforms, a commuter or intercity rail operator shall not employ a solution that has the effect of channeling passengers into a narrow space between the face of the higher-level platform and the edge of the lower platform.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this paragraph, any obstructions on a platform (mini-high platforms, stairwells, elevator shafts, seats etc.) shall be set at least six feet back from the edge of a platform.\n\n(2) If the six-foot clearance is not feasible (e.g., where such a clearance would create an insurmountable gap on a mini-high platform or where the physical structure of an existing station does not allow such clearance), barriers must be used to prevent the flow of pedestrian traffic through these narrower areas.\n\n(f) For purposes of this part, level-entry boarding means a boarding platform design in which the horizontal gap between a car at rest and the platform is no more than 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and the vertical height of the car floor is no more than 5.5 inches above the boarding platform. Where the horizontal gap is more than 3 inches and/or the vertical gap is more than 5\u20448 inch, measured when the vehicle is at rest, the horizontal and vertical gaps between the car floor and the boarding platform must be mitigated by a bridge plate, ramp, or other appropriate device consistent with 49 CFR 38.95(c) and 38.125(c).\n\n[76 FR 57935, Sept. 19, 2011]\n\n"

                "question": "What is the minimum width needed for a level boarding railroad passenger station platform to meet the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?",
                "answer": "Under 49 CFR Part 37, all new or altered railroad station platforms, including non-level boarding platforms, used for intercity rail passenger service or commuter rail passenger service must be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including persons who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or walkers. 49 CFR 37.9, 37.41-37.43, 37.55. We have received questions from entities constructing or altering platforms as to the minimum platform width needed to accommodate passengers using such mobility aid devices. This Q&A may be used as guidance for the minimum width needed for level boarding platforms.\n\nA level boarding intercity or commuter railroad passenger station platform can have a gap between the passenger car door threshold and the edge of the platform that is at the maximum horizontal dimension of 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and a maximum vertical dimension of 5.5 inches. 49 CFR 37.42(f). At level boarding platforms, where the gap exceeds plus or minus 5/8 inch vertical or 3 inches horizontal (49 CFR 37.42(f)), a bridge plate is typically used to allow a passenger using a wheelchair or other mobility device to move from the platform to the passenger car. While they can vary in dimensions, a typical bridge plate is approximately 3 feet long. Per ADAAG 304.3, a space of at least 5 feet is required on the platform for a passenger using a wheelchair to make a turn to enter the bridge plate and onto the passenger car.\n\nFor a conventional level boarding side passenger platform with a railing or a wall on the platform side opposite the track, the minimum platform width should be the sum of the maximum dimensions listed above \u2013 i.e., 8 feet.\n\nFor an end loading island passenger platform (where passengers are entering or exiting the platforms of a stub-end station) located between two tracks, our calculation needs to account for the width of tactile strips. The additional width of the tactile strips (2 feet) required by 49 CFR 37.9(a) (applying ADAAG 705.2 and 810.5.2) for the next track should be added to the above dimension, which yields a total minimum width of 10 feet for an end loading level boarding island platform.\n\nFor a level boarding island passenger platform with vertical pedestrian access (by elevator, stairs, escalators, etc.), the minimum width should be the width of the vertical access facility (typically in the range of 8-12 feet) plus twice the 6 feet required by 49 CFR 37.42(e)(1) for clearances around the sides of the stairwell, yielding 20-24 feet. The level boarding island with vertical pedestrian access platform may be tapered to 10 feet at the end(s) of the platform, as long as the gap between the car and the platform through the curved portion complies with 49 CFR 37.42(f), which defines the maximum allowable gap at level boarding platforms to be 10 inches on tangent and 13 inches on curved tracks.\n\nCircumstances may arise where a 15-inch high passenger platform designed to provide level boarding to typical bi-level passenger cars is also used by conventional single level passenger cars, which typically have 51-inch car door heights. In this case, the 3 feet allocated for a bridge plate should be replaced by either the 5 feet used by an on-board lift or 4 feet used by a platform mounted lift. Thus, a 15-inch high platform used by single level passenger cars should be treated as if it were a non-level boarding platform.",

For purposes of this section, a facility or station is \u201cnew\u201d if its construction begins (i.e., issuance of notice to proceed) after January 25, 1992, or, in the case of intercity or commuter rail stations, after October 7, 1991.\n\n(b) (1) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\n\n(2) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.\n\n(3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.\n\n[56 FR 45621, Sept. 6, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 63266, Oct. 30, 2006]\n\n\u00a7 37.55\nIntercity rail station accessibility.\n\nAll intercity rail stations shall be made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than July 26, 2010. This requirement is separate from and in addition to requirements set forth in \u00a7 37.43 of this part.\n\n\u00a7 37.42(f)\nFor purposes of this part, level-entry boarding means a boarding platform design in which the horizontal gap between a car at rest and the platform is no more than 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and the vertical height of the car floor is no more than 5.5 inches above the boarding platform. Where the horizontal gap is more than 3 inches and/or the vertical gap is more than 5\u20448 inch, measured when the vehicle is at rest, the horizontal and vertical gaps between the car floor and the boarding platform must be mitigated by a bridge plate, ramp, or other appropriate device consistent with 49 CFR 38.95(c) and 38.125(c).\n\n[76 FR 57935, Sept. 19, 2011]\n\n\u00a7 37.9(a)\nFor purposes of this part, a transportation facility shall be considered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if it meets the requirements of this part and the requirements set forth in Appendices B and D to 36 CFR part 1191, which apply to buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, as modified by Appendix A to this part.\n\n\u00a7 37.42(e)\nIn any situation using a combination of high and low platforms, a commuter or intercity rail operator shall not employ a solution that has the effect of channeling passengers into a narrow space between the face of the higher-level platform and the edge of the lower platform.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this paragraph, any obstructions on a platform (mini-high platforms, stairwells, elevator shafts, seats etc.) shall be set at least six feet back from the edge of a platform.\n\n(2) If the six-foot clearance is not feasible (e.g., where such a clearance would create an insurmountable gap on a mini-high platform or where the physical structure of an existing station does not allow such clearance), barriers must be used to prevent the flow of pedestrian traffic through these narrower areas.\n\n\u00a7 37.42(f)\nFor purposes of this part, level-entry boarding means a boarding platform design in which the horizontal gap between a car at rest and the platform is no more than 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and the vertical height of the car floor is no more than 5.5 inches above the boarding platform. Where the horizontal gap is more than 3 inches and/or the vertical gap is more than 5\u20448 inch, measured when the vehicle is at rest, the horizontal and vertical gaps between the car floor and the boarding platform must be mitigated by a bridge plate, ramp, or other appropriate device consistent with 49 CFR 38.95(c) and 38.125(c).\n\n[76 FR 57935, Sept. 19, 2011]\n\n"

                "answer": "Under 49 CFR section 37.42(c), when a new or altered platform is adjacent to a track shared with existing freight operations, the railroad providing passenger service, and other responsible parties, can either provide level boarding or ensure nondiscriminatory service to persons with disabilities by other means, such as car-borne lifts.\n\nWhen such a track is owned and controlled by a public entity receiving Federal financial assistance, such as Amtrak, a commuter authority, or a state or local agency, the recipient\u2019s obligation under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 also must be a consideration.\n\nUnder the Department's Section 504 rules (49 CFR section 27.7(b)(2)), public entities must provide persons with disabilities \u201cequal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting that is reasonably achievable.\u201d\n\nThe Department has long held that level-entry boarding provides passenger rail service in the most integrated setting reasonably achievable to persons with disabilities who are unable to climb steps.\n\nConsequently, even though section 37.42(c) provides discretion to provide access to rail cars through level boarding or other means when a track adjacent to a new or altered platform is shared with freight rail operations, recipients that own and control the track have an obligation under Section 504 to use that discretion to provide level boarding.",

                "answer": "There may be some situations where level boarding is not physically feasible (e.g., where the curvature of the track is too great to make level boarding workable).\n\nA railroad operator facing a potential situation of this kind should consult with FRA or FTA, as appropriate.\n\nIf FRA or FTA agrees that level boarding is not physically feasible, then the railroad would meet the performance standard of section 37.42(a) at the station through the means and process provided in section 37.42(c) \u2013 (d).\n\nHowever, the fact that other stations on a line do not provide level boarding is not a justification for failing to meet the level boarding requirement of section 37.42(b) at any particular station at which the rule applies. The Department views compliance with the requirements of the rule on a station-by-station basis.",
