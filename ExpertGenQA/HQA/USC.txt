(3)the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.).
(c)Grant Conditions.—The Secretary shall require as a condition of making any grant under this chapter for a project that uses rights-of-way owned by a railroad that—
(1)a written agreement exist between the applicant and the railroad regarding such use and ownership, including—
(A)any compensation for such use;
(B)assurances regarding the adequacy of infrastructure capacity to accommodate both existing and future freight and passenger operations;
(C)an assurance by the railroad that collective bargaining agreements with the railroad’s employees (including terms regulating the contracting of work) will remain in full force and effect according to their terms for work performed by the railroad on the railroad transportation corridor; and
(D)an assurance that an applicant complies with liability requirements consistent with section 28103 of this title; and
(2)the applicant agrees to comply with—
(A)the standards of section 24312 of this title, as such section was in effect on September 1, 2003, with respect to the project in the same manner that Amtrak is required to comply with those standards for construction work financed under an agreement made under section 24308(a) of this title; and
(B)the protective arrangements that are equivalent to the protective arrangements established under section 22404 with respect to employees affected by actions taken in connection with the project to be financed in whole or in part by grants under this chapter.
(d)Replacement of Existing Intercity Passenger Rail Service.—
(1)Collective bargaining agreement for intercity passenger rail projects.—Any entity providing intercity passenger railroad transportation that begins operations after the date of enactment of this Act [1] on a project funded in whole or in part by grants made under this chapter and replaces intercity rail passenger service that was provided by Amtrak, unless such service was provided solely by Amtrak to another entity or unless Amtrak ceased providing intercity passenger railroad transportation over the affected route more than 3 years before the commencement of new service, as of such date shall enter into an agreement with the authorized bargaining agent or agents for adversely affected employees of the predecessor provider that—
(A)gives each such qualified employee of the predecessor provider priority in hiring according to the employee’s seniority on the predecessor provider for each position with the replacing entity that is in the employee’s craft or class and is available within 3 years after the termination of the service being replaced;
(B)establishes a procedure for notifying such an employee of such positions;
(C)establishes a procedure for such an employee to apply for such positions; and
(D)establishes rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.
(2)Immediate replacement service.—
(A)Negotiations.—
If the replacement of preexisting intercity rail passenger service occurs concurrent with or within a reasonable time before the commencement of the replacing entity’s rail passenger service, the replacing entity shall give written notice of its plan to replace existing rail passenger service to the authorized collective bargaining agent or agents for the potentially adversely affected employees of the predecessor provider at least 90 days before the date on which it plans to commence service. Within 5 days after the date of receipt of such written notice, negotiations between the replacing entity and the collective bargaining agent or agents for the employees of the predecessor provider shall commence for the purpose of reaching agreement with respect to all matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1). The negotiations shall continue for 30 days or until an agreement is reached, whichever is sooner. If at the end of 30 days the parties have not entered into an agreement with respect to all such matters, the unresolved issues shall be submitted for arbitration in accordance with the procedure set forth in subparagraph (B).
(B)Arbitration.—
If an agreement has not been entered into with respect to all matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) as described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the parties shall select an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon the selection of such arbitrator within 5 days, either or both parties shall notify the National Mediation Board, which shall provide a list of seven arbitrators with experience in arbitrating rail labor protection disputes. Within 5 days after such notification, the parties shall alternately strike names from the list until only 1 name remains, and that person shall serve as the neutral arbitrator. Within 45 days after selection of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall conduct a hearing on the dispute and shall render a decision with respect to the unresolved issues among the matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1). The arbitrator shall be guided by prevailing national standard rates of pay, benefits, and working conditions for comparable work. This decision shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties. The salary and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties; all other expenses shall be paid by the party incurring them.
(3)Service commencement.—
A replacing entity under this subsection shall commence service only after an agreement is entered into with respect to the matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) or the decision of the arbitrator has been rendered.
(4)Subsequent replacement of service.—
If the replacement of existing rail passenger service takes place within 3 years after the replacing entity commences intercity passenger rail service, the replacing entity and the collective bargaining agent or agents for the adversely affected employees of the predecessor provider shall enter into an agreement with respect to the matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1). If the parties have not entered into an agreement with respect to all such matters within 60 days after the date on which the replacing entity replaces the predecessor provider, the parties shall select an arbitrator using the procedures set forth in paragraph (2)(B), who shall, within 20 days after the commencement of the arbitration, conduct a hearing and decide all unresolved issues. This decision shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties.
(e)Inapplicability to Certain Rail Operations.—Nothing in this section applies to—
(1)commuter rail passenger transportation (as defined in section 24102) operations of a State or local governmental authority (as those terms are defined in section 5302) eligible to receive financial assistance under section 5307 of this title, or to its contractor performing services in connection with commuter rail passenger operations (as so defined);
(2)the Alaska Railroad or its contractors; or
(3)Amtrak’s access rights to railroad rights of way and facilities under current law.
(f)Limitation.—
No grants shall be provided under this chapter for commuter rail passenger transportation (as defined in section 24102(3)).
